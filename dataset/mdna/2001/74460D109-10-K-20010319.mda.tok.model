item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors include the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  the company s ability to evaluate  finance  and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations  the company s ability to effectively compete in the markets that it does business in  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  the acceptance by consumers of the containerized storage concept  the impact of general economic conditions upon rental rates and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  and the availability of permanent capital at attractive rates 
overview the storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and is increasing from additional development of storage facilities in many markets which may negatively impact occupancy levels and rental rates at the storage facilities 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics which enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests as of december  in  storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of storage space in each market in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as radio advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals and  to a lesser extent  television advertising  which are generally not economically viable to our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  ii increasing our ownership of storage facilities through additional investments  iii improving the operating performance of the containerized storage business and iv participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc major elements of these strategies are as follows we will continue to focus upon enhancing the operating performance of our existing traditional self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
these increases in revenue levels are expected to result primarily from increases in realized rent per occupied square foot rather than significant increases in occupancy levels 
we expect to continue our storage facility development program 
over the past three years  the company and related development joint ventures opened a total of storage facilities at a cost of approximately million  with  net rentable square feet 
the company and a related development joint venture partnership have a total of projects identified for openings after december  at a total cost of million 
these projects which includes combination facilities are comprised of storage facilities for which we have acquired the land at december  total estimated costs upon completion of million  storage facilities identified for which we have not acquired the land estimated costs upon completion of approximately million and expansions of existing self storage facilities total estimated costs upon completion of million 
generally  the construction period takes nine to months  followed by an to month fill up process 
throughout the fill up period  we experience earnings dilution to the extent of our interest in the developed properties 
we will acquire facilities from third parties and affiliated entities when appropriate 
during  we acquired a total of storage properties and two commercial properties from third parties 
in addition  during  we acquired storage properties as well as the remaining partnership interest in properties that we did not already own from affiliated entities 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and marketing organization present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
we will continue to focus on improving the operations of the containerized storage operations 
the company is developing facilities that combine containerized storage and traditional self storage combination facilities which will replace existing third party leased facilities and reduce third party lease expense 
we believe that combination facilities offer efficiencies and a more effective method to meet customers needs than a stand alone containerized storage facility 
we expect that  upon completion of our combination facility development program  substantially all of the containerized storage facilities will be operated in combination facilities 
through our investment in ps business parks  inc  we will continue to participate in the growth of this company s investment in approximately commercial properties 
results of operations net income and earnings per common share net income for  and was   and  respectively 
the increase in net income was primarily the result of improved property operations  reduced operating losses from the containerized storage business  and the acquisition of additional real estate investments during and including the acquisition of storage trust 
the impact of these items was offset partially by an increased allocation of income to minority interests as a result of the issuance of preferred operating partnership units  referred to below combined with an increase in general and administration expense 
during  our capital raising activities included the issuance of approximately million in preferred operating partnership units in one of our controlled partnerships 
unlike distributions to preferred shareholders  distributions to preferred unitholders are presented as minority interest in income and a reduction in computing the company s net income 
as a result of these preferred distributions  minority interest in income increased  in the year ended december  as compared to and net income allocable to common shareholders for  and was   and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  net income was per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for  per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for and per common share based on weighted average shares outstanding of  for the decrease in net income per common share in as compared to reflects the inclusion of  common equivalent shares related to the company s class b common shares in  but not in or  as described more fully below 
the decrease in net income per share also includes increased dilution from uninvested proceeds from the company s issuance of fixed rate preferred securities  increased dilution from development activities  increased general and administrative expense  and the impact of the company s issuance of the equity stock  series a 
these factors were offset partially by improved property operations and reduced operating losses from the containerized storage business 
the increase in net income per share for compared to was principally the result of improved real estate operations and the impact of decreased operating losses of the containerized storage business 
in computing net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  aggregate dividends paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a and preferred equity securities have been deducted in determining net income allocable to the common shareholders 
distributions paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a totaled  in none in or 
distributions paid to preferred shareholders totaled  in   in and  in commencing january   the company s  class b common shares outstanding began to participate in distributions of the company s earnings 
distributions per share of class b common stock are equal to of the per share distribution paid to the company s regular common shares 
as a result of this participation in distributions of earnings  for purposes of computing net income per common share  the company began to include   x class b common shares in the weighted average common equivalent shares effective january  weighted average diluted shares for the years ended and do not include any shares with respect to the class b common stock as these shares did not participate in distributions of the company s earnings prior to january  real estate operations self storage operations our self storage operations are by far the largest component of our operations  representing approximately of total revenues generated during at the end of  we had a total of self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements 
since that time we have increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
as a result of significant acquisitions of self storage facilities in each of the past three years  year over year comparisons as presented on the consolidated statements of income with respect to our self storage operations are not meaningful 
to enhance year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes the operating results before depreciation of i the self storage facilities that are reflected in the financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the consistent group and ii all other self storage facilities for which operations were not reflected in the financial statements for the entire three years ended december  the other facilities self storage operations year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands  except rents per square foot rental income a consistent group     other facilities     cost of operations consistent group     other facilities     net operating income consistent group     other facilities     depreciation and amortization     operating income     consistent group data gross margin weighted average occupancy realized annual rent per square foot b scheduled annual rent per square foot

at end of period consistent group     other facilities     a rental income includes late charges and administrative fees 
for the consistent group late charges and administrative fees in aggregate totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
b realized annual rent per square foot is computed by annualizing rental income excluding late charges and administrative fees divided by the weighted average occupied square footage for the period 
the consistent group of facilities experienced increased revenues in and of and  respectively  as compared to the preceding year 
the increase in revenues in as compared to was caused primarily by a increase in realized rent per occupied square foot  offset by a reduction in average occupancy levels 
similarly  the increase in revenues in as compared to was caused primarily by a increase in realized rent per occupied square foot  with no change in average occupancy levels 
over the past several months  we have increased scheduled rents rental rates charged to new customers throughout the portfolio 
scheduled rental rates for the consistent group of facilities are approximately higher as of december  than they were at the same time last year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of higher rental rates on our move in and move out activity 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based on these analysis we may adjust rental rates further  either increasing or decreasing them 
as indicated above  the scheduled rental rates are the rates being charged to new customers 
the rental rates charged to our existing customer base  is on average  less than the current scheduled rates 
for  the average realized rental rate per square foot was approximately or below current scheduled rents 
our rental agreements are generally on a month by month basis giving us the flexibility to increase rates to our existing customers 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began to implement higher rental rates to our existing customer base 
the amount of increase will depend on a number of factors and may not result in rental rates equal to the level of scheduled rental rates 
there can be no assurance that higher rental rates will not adversely affect our occupancies 
cost of operations includes all direct and indirect costs of operating  marketing and managing the facilities 
the following table summarizes major operating expenses with respect to the consistent group in thousands payroll expense    property taxes    repairs and maintenance    advertising    telephone reservation center costs    other    increases in advertising cost are principally due to expanded yellow page advertising in telephone directories 
promotional advertising is an important part of our operational strategy 
our advertising activities have increased customer call volume into our national reservation system  where one of our representatives discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
during  call volume averaged approximately  calls per month  as compared to approximately  and  in and  respectively 
while there can be no assurance  we do not believe that the power crisis experienced currently in california will have any material impact upon our operations  for the year ended december   total consistent group utility expense was less than of total revenues 
telephone reservation center costs have increased due to the expansion of our telephone reservation system 
during  we opened our second call center in plano  texas 
in connection with the national telephone reservation system  we implement various pricing and promotional discount strategies designed to increase rental activity 
for the consistent group promotional discounts which are included as a reduction to gross rents to arrive at rental income were  in   in  and  in during the past three years  we have opened newly developed facilities in  in and none in with a total cost of approximately million 
included in the above table  under the caption other facilities  are revenues of  and  for and  respectively  and cost of operations of  and  for and  respectively  with respect to these facilities 
due to the fill up nature of a newly developed self storage facility  our earnings have been negatively impacted by our development activities 
unlike many other types of real estate  we do not pre lease our storage space prior to the opening of a newly developed facility 
generally  it takes approximately months for a newly developed facility to reach a stabilized occupancy level of 
at this stabilized occupancy level  operating costs represent approximately of stabilized rental revenues 
since the operating costs are substantially fixed in nature  a newly developed facility will not reach a break even operating cash flow until it achieves an occupancy level of approximately 
at december   the newly developed facilities had an average occupancy level of approximately 
we expect that over at least the next twelve months our development activities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings as additional newly developed facilities are opened 
see liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities 
during  the company acquired operating self storage facilities for an aggregate cost of million 
included in the above table for  under the caption other facilities  are revenues of  and cost of operations of  with respect to these facilities 
as described in note to the financial statements  on september   we acquired the remaining ownership interests in a partnership of which we are the general partner  for an aggregate acquisition cost of million  consisting of cash of million and the reduction of our pre existing investment in the amount of million 
included in the above table  under the caption other facilities  for are revenues of  and cost of operations of  with respect to these facilities 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in the consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and consolidated entities 
effective april   our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities 
during  we acquired two commercial facilities which are expected to be converted into storage facilities for an aggregate cost of  included within commercial property operations for with respect to these facilities was revenues of  and cost of operations of  the following table sets forth the historical commercial property amounts included in the financial statements commercial property operations year ended december  year ended december  change change amounts in thousands rental income     cost of operations     net operating income     depreciation expense     operating income     from the time of psb s formation through march   we consolidated the accounts of psb in our financial statements 
during the second quarter of  our ownership interest in psb was reduced below and  as a result  we no longer had a controlling interest in psb 
accordingly  effective april   we no longer include the accounts of psb in the consolidated financial statements and have accounted for our investment using the equity method 
for all periods after march   the income statement includes our share of income in psb 
further  commercial property operations for the periods after march  reflect only the commercial property operations of facilities owned by us which have both storage and commercial use combined at the same property location 
containerized storage operations in august  public storage pickup delivery psud  a subsidiary of the company  made its initial entry into the containerized storage business through its acquisition of a single facility operator located in irvine  california 
at december   pspud operated facilities in states 
the facilities are located in major markets in which we have significant market presence with respect to our traditional storage facilities 
due to the start up nature of the business  pspud incurred operating losses totaling approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  summarized as follows containerized storage year ended december  year ended december  dollar dollar change change dollar amounts in thousand rental and other income       cost of operations direct operating costs       marketing and advertising      facility lease expense       total cost of operations       operating gain loss prior to depreciation      depreciation expense a     operating losses       a depreciation for includes  with respect to real estate assets 
rental and other income includes monthly rental charges to customers for storage of the containers and service fees charged for pickup and delivery of containers to customers homes 
rental income increased to  in as compared to  in as a result of higher per container rents and an increase in occupied containers 
rental income increased to  in compared to  in principally as a result in increases in the number of occupied containers 
at december   there were approximately  occupied containers compared to  at december  and  at december  direct operating costs principally includes payroll  equipment lease expense  utilities and vehicle expenses fuel and insurance 
in addition  during  included in direct operating costs was  expensed due to the obsolescence of containers 
marketing and advertising expense decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the curtailment of television advertising in the second half of substantially all of the facilities in which pspud operates are leased from third parties 
over the past three years  facility lease expense has continued to decrease  in   in  and  in 
the reduction from to is principally the result of moving the operations from leased facilities to wholly owned facilities  and thus eliminating the lease expense paid to third parties 
the reduction from to is principally the result of the reduction in the number of facilities being operated 
at december   of the containerized storage facilities are leased from third parties 
we anticipate developing combination facilities which includes storage facilities that are being converted to combination facilities that combine self storage and containerized storage space in the same location 
these facilities are expected to replace of the leased facilities during we expect that an increasing part of the containerized storage business will be operated from this type of facility 
to the extent that these developed combination facilities replace existing third party leased facilities  lease expense should continue to be reduced 
the containerized storage operations may continue to adversely impact the company s future earnings and cash flows 
there can be no assurance as to the level of the containerized storage business s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of move outs or profitability 
equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of our pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon our ownership interest for the period 
similar to the company  the unconsolidated entities other than psb generate substantially all of their income from their ownership of storage facilities  which we manage 
in the aggregate  the unconsolidated entities including psb own a total of real estate facilities  of which are storage facilities

during  the company also recorded its pro rata share of gain on disposition of real estate investments totaling  this gain is included in the line item gain on disposition of real estate and real estate investments on our consolidated statements of income 
the increase in equity in earnings as compared to is principally the result of improved operations of psb  offset partially by the impact of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby we obtained a controlling interest in certain entities and began to include the accounts of such entities in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the consolidated financial statements  we used the equity method to report our share of the entities earnings 
equity in earnings of real estate entities includes income of   and  for  and  respectively  with respect to investments which no longer existed at december  the increase in equity in earnings of real estate entities compared to is principally the result of improved operations of psb  as well as the impact of the deconsolidation of psb effective april  whereby s equity in earnings includes a full year with respect to our interest in the operations of psb  and includes nine months of such interest 
the increase is partially offset by the impact of certain business combinations occurring in and whereby we acquired a controlling interest in certain entities and began to include the accounts of such entities in the consolidated financial statements 
prior to the inclusion of these entities in the consolidated financial statements  we used the equity method to report our share of the entities earnings 
equity in earnings of psb represents our pro rata share approximately of earnings of ps business parks  inc  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
as of december   we owned  common shares and  operating partnership units units which are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis in psb 
psb is a publicly traded real estate investment trust organized by the company on january  at december   psb owned properties located in states 
psb also manages the commercial properties owned by the company and affiliated entities in april  we formed a joint venture partnership the development joint venture with an institutional investor to participate in the development of approximately million of storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the institutional investor 
equity in earnings from the development joint venture reflects our pro rata share  based upon our ownership interest  of the operations of the development joint venture 
since inception through december   the development joint venture has developed and opened storage facilities with an aggregate cost of approximately million 
generally the construction period takes nine to months followed by a to month fill up process until the newly constructed facility reaches a stabilized occupancy level of approximately 
for fiscal   and  the majority of the completed facilities are in the fill up process and had not reached a stabilized occupancy level 
we expect that our earnings with respect to our investment in the development joint venture will continue to increase in as compared to as the existing properties continue to fill up 
during the first six months of fiscal  we acquired controlling interests in certain entities 
as a result of our ownership and control  we began to consolidate the accounts of these entities into our financial statements 
since we no longer account for our investment using the equity method  equity in earnings with respect to the other partnerships has decreased in as compared other income and expense items interest and other income interest in other income includes i the net operating results from our property management operations  ii merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals and iii interest income 
interest and other income has increased in as compared to principally as a result of higher cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts 
higher cash balances are primarily due to our issuance of preferred operating partnership units in and the timing of investing the proceeds into real estate assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in depreciation expense with respect to the real estate facilities was  in   in and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to non real estate assets  primarily depreciation of equipment associated with the containerized storage operations  was  in   in and  in amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for each of the three years ended december  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  certain overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  and overhead associated with the containerized storage business 
the increase includes an expansion in our product research and development efforts  as well as costs associated with lease terminations on leased containerized storage facilities which were replaced by newly developed facilities  and increased consulting fees 
the total amount of such expenses was approximately  in and  in none in 
in addition  during  we experienced an increase in costs relating to our development activities of approximately  when compared to although we expect that our general and administrative expense for fiscal will be less than what we experienced in we expect to exceed the level of general and administrative expense experienced in due to the following i the growth in the size of the company  ii additional lease termination cost with respect to the leased containerized storage facilities  and iii company s property acquisition and development activities have continued to expand  resulting in certain additional costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of additional real estate facilities 
interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is principally the result of increased capitalized interest 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in and  in in connection with our development activities 
the combined interest expense and capitalized interest was  in   in and  in the increase in as compared to is due to the carrying the million of notes payable assumed in the merger with storage trust for one full year in compared to months during  partially offset by regular principal amortization 
the increase in as compared to is due to the million of notes payable assumed in the merger with storage trust 
minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities  which are not owned by the company 
since  we have acquired portions of these equity interests through our acquisition of limited and general partnership interests in the consolidated entities 
these acquisitions have resulted in reductions to the minority interest in income from what it would otherwise have been in the absence of such acquisitions  and accordingly  have increased our share of the consolidated entities income 
in fiscal and  we acquired sufficient ownership interest and control in various partnerships and commenced including the accounts of these partnerships in the consolidated financial statements  resulting in an increase in minority interest in income 
the increase in minority interest in income in compared to is primarily related to the issuance of preferred operating partnership units in one of our consolidated partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in minority interest in income in compared to is the result of the deconsolidation of psb  partially offset by the consolidation of additional partnerships 
in determining income allocable to the minority interest for  and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense of approximately   and  respectively  was allocated to the minority interest 
the changes in depreciation allocated to the minority interest were principally the result of the factors denoted above with respect to minority interest in income 
supplemental property data and trends at december   there were approximately ownership entities owning in aggregate  storage facilities  including the facilities which we own and or operate 
at december   of these facilities were owned by unconsolidated entities  entities in which we have an ownership interest and use the equity method for financial statement presentation 
the remaining  facilities are owned by the company and consolidated entities

the facilities represent a consistent pool of properties which have been operated under the public storage name  at a stabilized level  by the company since january  from time to time  we remove facilities from the same store pool as a result of expansions  dispositions or other activities which make such facilities results not comparable to previous periods 
the same store group of properties includes facilities that are not consolidated in the financial statements 
accordingly  rental income and cost of operations with respect to these facilities are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the remaining facilities are included in the consolidated financial statements  however  many of them were not included in the consolidated financial statements throughout each of the three years presented

realized annual rent per square foot is computed by annualizing rental income excluding late charges and administrative fees divided by weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
in early  we implemented a national telephone reservation system designed to provide added customer service for all the storage facilities under management 
we believe that the improved operating results  as indicated in the above table  in large part are due to the success of the national telephone reservation system 
rental income for the same store facilities was net of promotional discounts totaling  in compared to  in and  in the storage facilities experience minor seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months

number of facilities liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see reit status below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to make the minority interests distributions  dividend payments to the preferred shareholders and capital improvements to maintain our facilities through the use of cash provided by operating activities

our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  proceeds from issuing equity securities and borrowings under our credit facility 
we intend to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facility from undistributed operating cash flow or  as market conditions permit and are determined to be advantageous  from the public or private placement of equity securities 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit 
outstanding debt at december  totaled million  consisting of mortgage debt of million and unsecured debt of million 
by comparison  our real estate facilities had a net book value of billion at december  accordingly  our portfolio of real estate facilities is substantially unencumbered 
we have generally only increased our debt in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred stock 
we have elected to use preferred stock as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred stock exceeds current interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  ii preferred stock allows us to leverage the common stock without the attendant interest rate or refinancing risks of debt  and iii like interest payments  dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distributions requirements  which have helped us to maintain a low common stock dividend payout ratio and retain cash flow 
our credit ratings on our senior preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by standard and poor s and fitch ibca 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate 
during  despite difficult capital markets  we privately issued million of preferred partnership units as follows million of series n cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units issued march   million of series o cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units issued march   and million of series p cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units issued august  
in addition  in december   we publicly issued million of equity stock  series a 
subsequent to december   we issued approximately million of our series q cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
distribution requirements we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since during  we paid regular quarterly distributions of per common share 
in addition  during the quarter ended september   a special distribution in the amount of per common share an aggregate of million was declared and paid 
distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
we expect to increase our common distribution in and beyond from the level of our regularly quarterly distribution level of per common share assuming a continuation of our increasing level of taxable income 
these increased distributions will be in the form of special distributions of cash or securities  an increase in the regular quarterly common distribution  or a combination thereof 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are noncumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
during  we paid dividends totaling million to the holders of our senior preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock  million to the holders of our class b common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to senior preferred stock outstanding at december  will be approximately million 
we estimate the annual distribution requirement with respect to the series q cumulative perpetual preferred stock to be approximately million per year 
our conservative distribution policy has been the principal reason for our ability to retain significant operating cash flows which have been used to make additional investments and reduce debt 
during  and  we paid regular distributions to common and class b shareholders of approximately  and of our cash available from operations allocable to common shareholders  respectively 
including the special distributions paid in and  we paid total distributions to common and class b shareholders of and  respectively  of our cash available from operations allocable to common shareholders

from time to time  some of these storage facilities or interests in them are available for purchase  providing us with a source of additional acquisition opportunities

in addition  on september   we acquired the remaining ownership interests in a partnership  of which we were the general partner  for an aggregate acquisition cost of million

our share of the cost of the real estate in the joint venture is approximately million at december  as of december   the joint venture had operating facilities  with  net rentable square feet and total development costs of approximately million 
in november  we formed a second joint venture partnership for the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from us and from the joint venture partner 
the term of the joint venture is years 
after six years  the joint venture partner has the right to cause the company to purchase the joint venture partner s interest for an amount necessary to provide them with a maximum return of or less in certain circumstances

approximately million of development cost is incurred as of december  we have acquired the land for of these projects  which have an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million  and costs incurred as of december  of approximately million 
the remaining facilities represent identified sites where we have an agreement in place to acquire the land generally within one year 
the development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies 
we estimate that the amount remaining to be spent of approximately million will be incurred over the next months

funds from operations total funds from operations or ffo increased to million for the year ended compared to million for the year ended and million in ffo available to common shareholders after deducting preferred stock dividends increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in and million in ffo means net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles before i gain loss on early extinguishment of debt  ii minority interest in income and iii gain loss on disposition of real estate  adjusted as follows i plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate assets including the company s pro rata share of depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated equity interests and amortization of assets acquired in a merger  including property management agreements and goodwill  and ii less ffo attributable to minority interests 
ffo is a supplemental performance measure for equity reits as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
the nareit definition does not specifically address the treatment of minority interest in the determination of ffo or the treatment of the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
in the case of the company  ffo represents amounts attributable to its shareholders after deducting amounts attributable to the minority interests and before deductions for the amortization of property management agreements and goodwill 
ffo is presented because management  as well as many industry analysts  consider ffo to be one measure of the performance of the company and it is used in establishing the terms of the class b common stock 
ffo does not take into consideration capital improvements  scheduled principal payments on debt  distributions and other obligations of the company 
accordingly  ffo is not a substitute for the company s cash flow or net income as discussed above as a measure of the company s liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define it exactly as we have defined it
