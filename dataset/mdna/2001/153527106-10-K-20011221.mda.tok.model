item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal  central s operations were grouped into three business segments  the lawn and garden branded products business  the pet branded products business and the distribution business 
in fiscal  central reorganized its garden and pet businesses 
under the reorganization  central s garden branded products and distribution businesses became one operating unit  garden products  while its pet branded products and distribution businesses became another operating unit  pet products 
for fiscal  garden products and pet products accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated net sales before corporate eliminations 
these businesses accounted for income from operations before other charges and the allocation of certain corporate costs and eliminations of million and million  respectively  in fiscal the company experienced a net loss of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
one of the measures management uses to evaluate the performance of its business segments is earnings before other charges  unusual items  interest  taxes and amortization and depreciation ebitda excluding other income  other charges and unusual items  which represented income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the discussion below  and the following presentation  are intended to assist the reader in understanding the results of our operations 
this presentation is not intended to replace net income loss  cash flows or financial position  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

shown below is a summary of these expenses  which the company believes were unusual in nature during fiscal pet products garden products corporate company in thousands closed branches   personnel reductions    excess freight   legal professional   excess bad debt   pre press publication inventory write downs    during the last two fiscal years  the company has been adversely affected by a number of events 
at the end of fiscal  the company s exclusive distribution agreement for solaris products ended 
during fiscal  scotts began to distribute both its miracle gro and solaris products through a system that involved a combination of distributors as well as direct sales to certain major retailers 
this change  compared with fiscal  reduced revenue by approximately million in fiscal before the end of fiscal  scotts discontinued its distribution relationship with the company 
as a consequence  sales volumes for future periods were expected to significantly decline  which resulted in the company initiating a plan to close distribution centers 
the closures and the related workforce reductions  employee benefit obligations and asset impairments resulted in other charges for fiscal of million 
as a result  sales of other companies products by garden products in fiscal declined approximately million compared with fiscal also in fiscal  both scotts and pharmacia initiated litigation against the company arising out of the prior distribution relationship  and the company filed suit against scotts and pharmacia for breach of contract and violations of the antitrust laws as discussed above in item legal proceedings 
in august  a fire destroyed the company s leased facility in arizona and an adjoining warehouse space leased by a third party 
various parties have filed lawsuits  and both the arizona department of environmental quality and the us environmental protection agency have requested information relating to the fire 
lawyers and specialists representing several insurance companies have been meeting since august to determine the extent of liability for the various parties involved 
at this time the precise amount of damages  the ultimate determination of the parties responsible and the availability of insurance coverage are likely to depend on the outcome of complex litigation 
much of the discovery work on the above lawsuits and the other litigation described above in item legal proceedings was conducted during fiscal and will continue into fiscal as a result of the litigation  the company incurred legal  accounting and other professional expenses of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company believes that legal and professional fees for fiscal will approximate the fiscal level and will decline significantly in subsequent years 
despite downsizing  the distribution operations of our garden products segment continued to adversely affect profitability in fiscal in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america  certain costs related to the closed distribution centers were not included as part of the million of other charges recorded in fiscal these costs included wages and related benefits for those employees who stayed on to either sell off certain of the remaining inventory or arrange to ship inventory to other central locations  or arrange to secure temporary storage until the inventory could be moved to other central locations 
likewise  freight costs incurred to ship inventory from the closed locations to open facilities were not included in the fiscal other charges 
these costs were incurred and recorded in fiscal the company underestimated the costs the remaining distribution centers would incur to service customers formerly serviced by the closed locations 
since many of these customers were outside of the local area  most of the product sold to them was shipped by common carrier 
additionally  assimilating the extra inventory from the closed locations created inefficient warehouse operations 
with warehouse space severely limited because of the additional inventory  picking  packing and shipping an order took significantly longer than normal 
to ship product timely under these conditions meant increasing the amount of outside labor 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  two large customers of garden products filed for bankruptcy 
during the last quarter of fiscal  and continuing in the first quarter of fiscal  the company further reduced personnel and related people costs in both our businesses 
the reductions in our garden products segment were largely in the administrative areas where the company consolidated certain computer operations and administrative functions into one logistics operation 
pet products closed three smaller under performing distribution centers during fiscal and a small manufacturing facility which produced nylon collars and leashes 
these products are now secured through outside vendors 
these closures resulted in additional facility and personnel costs being incurred in fiscal which totaled million 
in addition  sales of tfh pet books are declining due to  among other things  reduced floor space allocated to books by the larger retailers in favor of other pet products which turn faster than books 
however  book production was not reduced to meet the lower sales volume 
on hand inventory of books included titles with little current consumer appeal  and in certain cases large quantities of books remained on hand  which had been produced in and prior 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of book inventory to its estimated realizable value 
in addition  million of pre press publication costs  which were being amortized over the anticipated useful life of specific titles  were determined to be unrecoverable in light of the sales decline and were written off 
in garden products  pennington wrote down its bahia grass seed inventory as a result of a significant decline in the market price for that particular variety 
in connection with the closure of distribution centers in fiscal  management evaluated the inventory remaining from such locations during fiscal to determine its estimated realizable value 
due to the age of the inventory which remained combined with the fact that more of this inventory became obsolete due to packaging changes made by the manufacturer  a further write down was taken in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to net sales fiscal year ended september  september  september  net sales cost of goods sold and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative other charges income from operations interest expense  net other income income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased by or million to  million from  million for fiscal the decrease is due to a million decrease in net sales of garden products offset in part by a sales increase in pet products of million 
adjusting for newly acquired operations  the sales decrease in garden products was million and in pet products net sales would have resulted in a decrease of million 
the decrease in garden products relates to the sales and logistics group  which was expected after we closed distribution centers in late fiscal as a result of the termination of our distribution relationship with scotts 
the sales decrease in our pet products business was attributable to the closure of three pet distribution centers during fiscal and a modest decline in kaytee sales of wild birdseed 
in fiscal  arch  a major pool chemical supplier  and kal kan  a supplier of dog food  notified us that they each intend to terminate their relationship with the company and distribute their products directly to retailers 
in fiscal  sales of arch products were approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
sales of kal kan products to independent retailers were approximately million in fiscal the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was estimated to be million based on historical customer profitability 
in addition  the kal kan business lost includes approximately million of fees related to shipments to petsmart 
the loss of the kal kan business contributed to the decision to close two smaller pet distribution centers during the first quarter of fiscal with a third facility closure planned for february gross profit decreased by million or from million during fiscal to million for fiscal adjusting for newly acquired operations  gross profit would have decreased by or million 
the decrease in gross profit dollars relates principally to the sales and logistics group within garden products  while pet products generated approximately the same gross profit dollars as in fiscal gross profit for both segments was adversely affected by inventory and inventory related write downs in fiscal in pet products  tfh reduced the carrying value of their book inventory by million and wrote off million of pre press publication costs 
the inventory write down is primarily the result of a continuing sales decline in pet books which in turn has created excess and obsolete book inventory 
the decline in pet book sales relates principally to reduced floor space allocated to books by the large retailers coupled with a reduction in the number of titles they will carry 
in garden products  pennington wrote down its bahia grass seed inventory by million as a result of a significant decline in the market price for that particular variety 
in connection with the closure of distribution centers in fiscal  management  at the existing centers  evaluated the inventory at these facilities to determine the amount of potential overstock and to assess how much inventory could be moved to those locations which would remain open 
this evaluation resulted in a write down of million in fiscal to adjust the inventory to its estimated realizable value 
due to the age of the inventory which remained combined with the fact that more of this inventory became obsolete due to packaging changes made by the manufacturer  management s evaluation of its estimated realizable value resulted in a further write down of million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to during fiscal from for fiscal the percentage improvement is principally due to a reduction in sales of other companies products within garden products  which accounted for a significantly lower percentage of total sales 
sales of other companies products result in lower gross margins compared to sales of central s own proprietary branded products 
overall  garden products gross profit improved from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million during fiscal to million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to for fiscal selling and delivery expenses decreased by million  which was net of a million increase related to newly acquired operations  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling and delivery expenses related to existing business in fiscal relates principally to a sales decline in garden products compared with fiscal of million offset by increased freight costs 
included in fiscal selling and delivery expense was approximately million attributable to the closure of three pet products branches during fiscal and increased freight costs to service out of market customers transferred from garden products distribution centers closed in fiscal facilities expense decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in fiscal is approximately million related to newly acquired businesses 
warehouse and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately million related to newly acquired businesses 
of the million increase from existing operations  approximately million was attributable to pet products  million to garden products and million to corporate 
the increase of million compared with fiscal related principally to additional bad debt provisions of million  of which million relates to two large garden products customers who went bankrupt or ceased operations during the last month of fiscal  increased legal and professional fees of million  which included in fiscal approximately million associated with the fire at our arizona warehouse and the litigation work related to the scotts and tfh lawsuits  an increase in general and medical insurance of million  increased depreciation and goodwill amortization of million  as a result of the closure of garden products and pet products locations  there has been a significant decrease in both sales and inventory levels  which resulted in an million increase in the amount of purchasing  merchandise handling and storage costs charged to warehouse and administration expense  and not included as inventory costs  compared to the prior year  increased information systems costs of million primarily new systems being implemented to centralize sales  marketing  inventory and financial data  an increase in personnel and other professional costs for research and development of million  and increases in office rents and general increases in normal operating expenses of million 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million to million from million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is due to new long term borrowings resulting principally from the businesses acquired  offset by lower average short term interest rates 
average short term borrowings for the fiscal year ended september  were million compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  the average short term interest rates for the fiscal years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recognized a tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the tax benefit was affected by certain goodwill amortization which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal decreased by or million to  million from  million for fiscal the decrease was due to a million decrease in garden products sales million attributable to reduced sales of other companies products  primarily sales of solaris products  which was partially offset by million in sales of existing branded product offerings and million in sales attributable to businesses acquired norcal pottery  acquired in january  unicorn laboratories  acquired in december  and the amdro and image product lines  acquired in march being partially offset by a million increase in pet products sales 
gross profit decreased by million or from million during fiscal to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars was principally related to a million decrease in garden products gross profit partially offset by a million increase in pet products gross profit 
as a result of resizing our lawn and garden distribution operations  the carrying value of inventory at the distribution centers to be closed was evaluated to determine what products could be moved to the locations remaining open  how much of it would represent significant overstock and what products would have to be liquidated at the individual distribution centers 
this evaluation resulted in a write down of lawn and garden inventory of million to adjust such inventory to its estimated realizable value 
this write down resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold and occupancy of million in fiscal compared with the inventory write down of million recorded in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by an increase in garden products resulting from a larger proportion of higher margin branded product sales relative to total sales due to the reduction in sales of low margin solaris products principally to retailers distribution centers 
pet products gross profit percentage remained relatively constant 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million during fiscal to million for fiscal of the million increase  approximately million was attributed to newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during fiscal to for fiscal selling and delivery expenses increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
these increases were offset by a decrease from existing operations of million primarily attributable to a million decrease in lawn and garden distribution operations resulting from lower sales  offset by a million increase principally related to pennington as a result of increased coop and media advertising  and expanded use of common freight carriers coupled with increased fuel costs 
facilities expense totaled million in both fiscal and this results from an increase in costs associated with newly acquired businesses of million  offset by a reduction in costs associated with existing operations of million 
the decrease in existing operations related principally to lawn and garden distribution operations resulting from certain facilities which were closed during fiscal warehouse and administrative expense increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal of this increase  million related to newly acquired businesses 
the increase from existing operations  million  related principally to increases in legal and professional fees of million related to our strategic planning and evaluation process  increases in corporate personnel and related travel of million and million in additional corporate office space costs 
in september  the company recorded million of charges resulting from workforce reductions  employee benefit obligations  facility closures  and asset impairments that were necessary due to the termination of the company s distribution arrangement with scotts and other anticipated sales decreases in garden products 
these charges were offset by the reversal of million of certain exit related costs recorded in connection with the fiscal restructuring plan for which the company was no longer obligated 
as a result of the fiscal  and anticipated future  sales decreases in garden products  the company initiated a plan to close distribution centers and reduce its workforce which was completed in fiscal in connection with this plan  the company recorded a severance charge of million associated with the termination of employees  primarily in the sales force and distribution centers 
severance of million was paid to employees terminated during fiscal  with the balance expected to be paid to employees who will be terminated in fiscal in connection with the facilities closures  million was accrued for estimated lease costs  and million for estimated property tax and facilities maintenance costs  that the company is obligated to pay for periods subsequent to closure 
the company also recorded an million impairment charge to reduce certain facility assets to their estimated fair value based on an independent appraisal  and an million provision for estimated uncollectible receivables from customers of the closed facilities 
in addition  as a direct result of the termination of the distribution relationship with scotts  the company recorded a charge of million as the company became obligated to make cash payments which were guaranteed to certain employees in the event of such termination 
these payments were paid during fiscal as a result of the events described above  management reevaluated the recoverability of certain intangible assets in garden products 
based on an evaluation of estimated future cash flows associated with affected facilities  the company determined that goodwill and certain trademarks were impaired  and accordingly recorded charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce those assets to estimated fair values 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million to million from million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase is due to higher average outstanding short term debt resulting principally from the company s stock repurchase program and the businesses acquired 
during the fiscal year ended september   the company repurchased  shares of its stock for a total cost of approximately million  primarily through the use of its revolving credit facility 
average short term borrowings for the fiscal year ended september  were million compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  the average short term interest rates for the fiscal years ended september  and september  were and  respectively 
during fiscal the company recognized tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million primarily as the result of non deductible charges  primarily goodwill amortization and impairment charges  recorded during the year 
new accounting pronouncements see note  organization and significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  the company believes that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth through a combination of bank borrowings  supplier credit  internally generated funds and sales of securities to the public 
the company received net proceeds after offering expenses of approximately million from its five public offerings of common stock in july  november  july  august and january in november  the company completed the sale of million subordinated convertible notes generating approximately million net of underwriting commissions 
historically  the company s business has been highly seasonal and its working capital requirements and capital resources tracked closely to this seasonal pattern 
during the first fiscal quarter accounts receivable reach their lowest level while inventory  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase 
since the company s short term credit line fluctuates based upon a specified asset borrowing base  this quarter is typically the period when the asset borrowing base is at its lowest and consequently the company s ability to borrow is at its lowest 
during the second fiscal quarter  receivables  accounts payable and short term borrowings begin to increase  reflecting the build up of inventory and related payables in anticipation of the peak selling season 
during the third fiscal quarter  inventory levels remain relatively constant while accounts receivable peak and short term borrowings start to decline as cash collections are received during the peak selling season 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory levels are at their lowest  and accounts receivable and payables are substantially reduced through conversion of receivables to cash 
as a result of the termination of the solaris agreement and the associated reduction in distribution sales as a percentage of overall sales  this seasonal pattern is expected to be less significant in the future 
the company s businesses service two broad markets lawn and garden and pet supplies 
the pet supplies businesses involve products that have a year round selling cycle with very little change quarter to quarter 
as a result  it is not necessary to carry large quantities of inventory to meet peak demands 
additionally  this level sales cycle eliminates the need for manufacturers to give extended credit terms to either distributors or retailers 
on the other hand  the garden products businesses are highly seasonal with approximately of their aggregate sales occurring during the fiscal second and third quarters 
for many manufacturers of garden products this seasonality requires them to move large quantities of their product well ahead of the peak selling periods 
to encourage distributors to carry large amounts of inventory  industry practice has been for manufacturers to give extended credit terms and or promotional discounts 
the company generated cash from operating activities of million during fiscal  which declined from million during fiscal  primarily due to the decline in sales volume during the year 
net cash used in investing activities of million resulted from acquisitions of new companies and the acquisition of office and warehouse equipment  including computer hardware and software 
net cash used in financing activities of million consisted principally of net repayments of million under the company s lines of credit and payments of million related to long term debt  partially offset by million in new long term borrowings 
the company has a million line of credit with congress financial corporation western 
the available amount under the line of credit fluctuates based upon a specific asset borrowing base 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus at the company s option  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
at september   the company had million of outstanding borrowings  and had million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
the company s line of credit contains certain financial covenants such as minimum net worth and minimum working capital requirements 
the line also requires the lender s prior written consent to any acquisition of a business 
the company s pennington subsidiary also has a million line of credit 
at september   there were million of outstanding borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
interest related to this line is based on a rate either equal to the prime rate or libor plus 
at the company s option 
the company all glass aquarium subsidiary also has a million line of credit 
as of september   there were million of borrowings and million of available borrowing capacity under this line 
interest related to this line is based on a rate equal to the prime rate less at september excluding the potential impact of any adverse consequences associated with legal matters discussed below and in more detail in item legal proceedings  the company believes that cash flows from operating activities  funds available under its lines of credit  and arrangements with suppliers will be adequate to fund its presently anticipated working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures will not exceed million for the next months 
the company is involved in a number of lawsuits  several of which could result in substantial monetary judgments 
this litigation includes three significant cases between the company and scotts and pharmacia which are currently set for trial on january  march and july  respectively 
depending on how and when these lawsuits are resolved  these lawsuits could result in substantial changes to the company s liquidity position either favorable or unfavorable 
the company is currently exploring a number of possible ways to enhance its liquidity  including  among other things  additional debt financing by the company or one or more of its subsidiaries and or an equity offering 
in november  the company issued million of subordinated convertible notes 
the principal amount of the notes will become due on november   unless converted into common stock by the holders or redeemed by the company prior to maturity 
as part of its growth strategy  the company has engaged in acquisition discussions with a number of companies in the past and it anticipates it will continue to evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
if one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  become available in the near future  the company may require additional external capital 
in addition  such acquisitions would subject the company to the general risks associated with acquiring companies  particularly if the acquisitions are relatively large 
weather and seasonality historically  the company s sales of lawn and garden products have been influenced by weather and climate conditions in the markets it serves 
additionally  the company s business has historically been highly seasonal 
in fiscal  approximately of garden products sales occurred in the first six months of the calendar year 
substantially all of garden products operating income is typically generated in this period which has historically offset the operating losses incurred during the first fiscal quarter of the year 
risk factors relating to forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include information regarding future financial results  the estimated effect of the termination of the solaris agreement and future acquisition activity 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
we have separated the risks into three groups 
risks that relate to central generally  
risks that relate to garden products  and 
risks that relate to pet products 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 
if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
risks relating to central generally our quarterly operating results are susceptible to fluctuations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we expect to continue to experience variability in our net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
factors that may contribute to this variability include 
weather conditions and seasonality during peak gardening seasons  
shifts in demand for lawn and garden products  
shifts in demand for pet products  
changes in product mix  service levels and pricing by us and our competitors  
the effect of acquisitions  
economic stability of retail customers  and 
the extent of lost business from the termination of distribution relationships  such as with scotts  and our ability to offset the loss of gross profit as a result of the terminations through expense reductions and other business growth 
in addition  because our distribution businesses operate on relatively low margins  our operating results in any quarterly period could be affected significantly by slight variations in revenues or operating costs 
for the same reason  our quarterly results also may be vulnerable to problems in areas such as collectibility of accounts receivable  inventory control and competitive price pressures 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to these variations in quarterly operating results and other factors 
because of intense competition  central s distribution related sales generate low margins 
the lawn and garden and pet supply distribution industries in which we operate are characterized by relatively low profit margins 
as a result  central s success is highly dependent upon effective cost and management controls and differentiating its services from those of its competitors 
the wholesale lawn and garden and pet supply distribution businesses are highly competitive  with many companies competing principally on the basis of price and service 
in addition to competition from other distributors  central also competes with manufacturers and suppliers that elect to distribute certain of their products directly to retailers  including central s major customers  and private label product suppliers 
for example  beginning in fiscal  scotts began to distribute ortho r  roundup r and miracle gro r directly to certain retailers 
similarly  in  arch pool chemicals and kal kan foods notified central that they intend to terminate their distribution relationships with central and distribute their products directly to retailers 
there can be no assurance that central will not encounter increased competition in the future or will not lose business from major manufacturers that elect to sell their products directly to retailers  either of which could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
our ability to grow will depend upon internal expansion and acquisitions 
as part of our growth strategy  we aggressively pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  adverse short term effects on our operating results  integration of financial reporting systems and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
since  central has completed over acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses or that such businesses will enhance our business 
we have also had preliminary acquisition discussions with  or have evaluated the potential acquisition of  numerous other companies over the last several years 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of a material acquisition being completed in the future 
we may seek to finance any such acquisition through additional debt or equity financings  which could result in dilution and additional risk for the holders of our common stock 
we anticipate that one or more potential acquisition opportunities  including those that would be material  may become available in the near future 
if and when appropriate acquisition opportunities become available  we intend to pursue them actively 
no assurance can be given that any acquisition by us will or will not occur  that if an acquisition does occur that it will not materially and adversely affect us or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing our business 
our future results of operations will also depend in part on our ability to successfully expand internally by increasing the number of new product lines  and to manage any future growth 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain or integrate additional product lines or manage any future growth successfully 
our success is dependent upon retaining key personnel 
our future performance is substantially dependent upon the continued services of william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  glenn w 
novotny  our president and chief operating officer  and brooks m 
pennington iii  the president of pennington 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees in the future 
the holders of our class b stock  through their voting power  can greatly influence control of the company 
as of december   william e 
brown  our chairman and chief executive officer  controls approximately of the voting power of our capital stock and  therefore  can effectively control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the power to elect all of our directors 
holders of class b stock are entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or of the total votes cast 
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share owned 
the holders of class b stock have of the combined voting power  subject to the aforementioned voting restrictions 
holders of class b stock are likely to be able to elect all of our directors  control our management and policies and determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders except to the extent that a class vote of the common stock is required by applicable law 
the disproportionate voting rights of the common stock and class b stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
such disproportionate voting rights may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be  or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal  a tender offer or a proxy contest  even if such actions were favored by our common stockholders 
accordingly  such disproportionate voting rights may deprive holders of common stock of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices  since takeover bids frequently involve purchases of stock directly from stockholders at such a premium price 
the products that we manufacture and distribute may subject us to environmental considerations 
many of the products that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations are often complex and are subject to change 
environmental regulations may affect us by restricting the manufacturing or use of our products or regulating their disposal 
regulatory or legislative changes may cause future increases in our operating costs or otherwise affect operations 
although we believe we are and have been in substantial compliance with such regulations and has strict internal guidelines on the handling and disposal of our products  there is no assurance that in the future we may not be adversely affected by such regulations or incur increased operating costs in complying with such regulations 
however  neither the compliance with regulatory requirements nor our environmental procedures can ensure that we will not be subject to claims for personal injury  property damages or governmental enforcement 
the products that we manufacture could expose us to product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  which are inherent in the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products 
although we generally seek to insure against such risks  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms 
a successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on us and could prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
we have pending litigation which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are a party to certain legal proceedings including the litigation between us and scotts and pharmacia arising out of disputes regarding the termination of the solaris agreement and litigation arising from a fire which destroyed our phoenix  arizona facility 
we are currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss  if any  that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of these proceedings 
regardless of the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  they could result in significant diversion of time by our management 
the results of these proceedings  including any potential settlements  are uncertain and we cannot assure you that the outcome of these disputes will not adversely affect our operating results 
among the proceedings in which we are involved are three significant cases between us and scotts and pharmacia which are currently set for trial on january  march and july  respectively 
depending on how and when these lawsuits are resolved  these lawsuits could result in substantial changes to the company s liquidity position either favorable or unfavorable 
for more information on our pending litigation  please see item legal proceedings 
risks relating to garden products adverse weather during the peak gardening season can hurt garden products and our net sales 
because demand for lawn and garden products is significantly influenced by weather  particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season  our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures  water shortages or floods 
during the last several years  our results of operations were negatively affected by severe weather conditions in some parts of the country 
additionally  our business is highly seasonal  with approximately of garden products sales in fiscal occurring during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
historically  substantially all of garden products operating income is generated in this period 
an increase in market prices for seeds and grains used to produce bird seed and grass seed or a decrease in demand for bird seed or grass seed could have a negative impact on our operating income 
garden products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of garden products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our pennington subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity seeds and grains  used to produce bird seed and grass seed 
historically  market prices for commodity seeds and grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
for example  a significant rise in the white millet acquisition cost in late and had a negative impact on profitability of bird feed products in fiscal  although we do not believe this will be a long term problem 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  garden products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
we cannot assure you as to the timing or extent of garden products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by garden products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
in fiscal  garden products was adversely affected by a worldwide oversupply of certain grass seeds brought on by a combination of weather issues  generally poor economic conditions in agriculture  and diseases  like hoof and mouth and mad cow  that reduce demand for seed 
if the oversupply extends into fiscal  our operating results would suffer 
to protect against changes in market prices  we generally enter into purchase contracts for grains  bird seed and grass seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
in contrast  if market prices for grains decrease because of a lack of demand  we may end up purchasing grains and seeds pursuant to the purchase contracts at prices above market 
garden products depends on a few customers  including wal mart  lowes and home depot  for a significant portion of its net sales 
garden products largest customer is wal mart  which accounted for approximately  and of its net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
garden products second largest customer is home depot  which accounted for approximately  and of its net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales to lowe s accounted for approximately  and of its net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the market share of these three retailers in the lawn and garden industry has increased during the last several years 
during fiscal  wal mart began to have certain products delivered to its internal distribution centers rather than directly to stores  which adversely affected our revenue from these products 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  wal mart informed central of a number of significant changes in its lawn and garden supplies purchasing programs and procedures for the coming year 
these include wal mart s decision to purchase certain lawn and garden supplies directly from a number of manufacturers whose lawn and garden supplies had previously been sold through central  a change from store door deliveries of many of the lawn and garden supplies formerly delivered by central to individual wal mart stores to a new procedure whereby central will ship these products to wal mart distribution centers  and wal mart s decision not to have central personnel perform lawn and garden supplies merchandising functions inside wal mart stores 
as a result of these factors  and the closing of distribution centers associated with the garden products restructuring  garden product s sales of lawn and garden supplies to wal mart in declined significantly 
the distribution facility closures coupled with the absence of our distributing scotts products in has also adversely impacted other customer relationships 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between us and wal mart  home depot or lowe s could cause our net sales and income from operations to decline 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could reduce our income from operations 
our net sales and operating income from distributing other company s garden products decreased significantly in fiscal due to the termination of our distribution relationship with scotts and may continue to decrease in the future 
from october  to september   we distributed solaris product nationwide  pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement 
sales of products purchased from solaris  previously our largest supplier  accounted for approximately of garden product s net sales and of central s net sales during fiscal in january  pharmacia sold its solaris lawn and garden business exclusive of its roundup r herbicide products for consumer use to scotts and entered into a separate  long term  exclusive agreement pursuant to which pharmacia continues to make roundup herbicide products for consumer use and scotts markets the products 
beginning october   scotts began to distribute ortho r and roundup r products through a system that involved a combination of distributors  of which we were the largest  as well as through direct sales by scotts to certain major retailers 
in addition  scotts began to sell miracle gro r directly to certain retailers 
effective september   scotts discontinued its distribution relationship with central 
the affected products included scotts r  ortho r and miracle gro r products and consumer roundup r products manufactured by pharmacia corporation formerly known as monsanto company for which scotts acts as pharmacia s exclusive sales agent 
for central s fiscal year ended september   the revenue attributable to the affected products was approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was estimated to be million based on historical customer profitability 
due to the termination of the scotts distribution relationship  we took actions to downsize our lawn and garden distribution operations to reflect anticipated business levels for the fiscal year as a result  we recorded charges of million in the fiscal year ending september  we cannot assure you that our lawn and garden distribution operations will be able to operate profitably at the reduced revenue levels forecasted for fiscal if our current downsizing efforts are not successful  we may be forced to record additional charges in fiscal  which would decrease our operating results further 
the sale of the solaris business by pharmacia  the expiration of the solaris agreement and termination of the scotts distribution relationship subject our business to significant uncertainties 
these include the resolution of all payments due between us and pharmacia under the solaris agreement  such as the amounts receivable from pharmacia for cost reimbursements and payments for cost reductions  the amounts payable to pharmacia for inventory  and responsibility for obsolete inventory and for non payment by solaris sub agents 
scotts and pharmacia have each initiated litigation against central arising out of the prior distribution relationship 
in addition  central has filed suit against scotts and pharmacia seeking damages and injunctive relief as well as restitution for  among other things  breach of contract and violations of the antitrust laws by scotts and pharmacia 
because of the uncertainties inherent in complex litigation  it is not currently possible to make an assessment of the potential impact  losses or gains that may arise out of these cases individually or collectively 
central believes that  in the aggregate  the reconciliation of all accounts and claims with pharmacia and scotts  as described above in item legal proceedings  will not result in additional charges to central 
further  central believes it has substantial counterclaims and rights of offset against both scotts and pharmacia  as well as meritorious defenses  and intends to vigorously contest both suits 
however  there can be no assurance that the resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position and or cash flows 
the loss of the arch pool chemicals business may necessitate the closure of additional garden distribution centers 
in  arch pool chemicals notified garden products that it will discontinue its distribution relationship with several of our garden product and deliver its product directly to retailers 
for fiscal  the revenue attributable to the affected products was approximately million 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
if we are unable to offset the loss of gross profit as a result of the termination through expense reductions and other business growth  our operating income would be adversely impacted and we may be required to close additional underutilized garden distribution centers 
risks relating to pet products pet products depends on a few customers  including petsmart and petco  for a significant portion of its net sales 
pet products largest customer is petsmart  which accounted for approximately  and of pet products net sales for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
pet products second largest customer is petco  which accounted for approximately  and of pet products net sales for fiscal  fiscal and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant adverse change in  the relationship between pet products and petsmart or petco could have a material adverse effect on pet products business and financial results 
the loss of or reduction in orders from any significant customer  losses arising from customer disputes regarding shipments  fees  merchandise condition or related matters  or pet products inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
an increase in market prices for grains could have a negative impact on our operating income 
pet products financial results depend to a large extent on the cost of raw materials and the ability of pet products to pass along to its customers increases in these costs 
in particular  our kaytee subsidiary is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for commodity grains 
historically  market prices for commodity grains have fluctuated in response to a number of factors  including changes in united states government farm support programs  changes in international agricultural and trading policies and weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons 
in the event of any increases in raw materials costs  pet products would be required to increase sales prices for its products in order to avoid margin deterioration 
there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of pet products ability to implement future price adjustments in the event of increased raw material costs or as to whether any price increases implemented by pet products may affect the volumes of future shipments 
to protect against changes in market prices  we generally enter into purchase contracts for grains and bird seed to cover up to approximately one third of the purchase requirements for a selling season 
since we hedge only a portion of our purchase requirements  if market prices for grains increase  our cost of production would increase 
the majority of our pet supply distribution sales are made to independent pet retailers  whose market share has been eroded by the growth of national specialty pet stores 
historically  a majority of our pet supply distribution sales have been made to independent pet retailers 
in recent years  these independent pet retailers have experienced severe competition from and a loss of market share to national specialty pet retailers  like petsmart and petco  and mass merchants  like wal mart  kmart and target 
the future success of our pet supply distribution business will depend on our ability to offer competitive costs and value added services to independent pet dealers and to increase sales to national specialty pet retailers and mass merchants 
if independent pet retailers continue to lose market share to national specialty pet retailers and we are unable to expand our business with these pet retailers  pet product s net sales will decline and our operating income will suffer 
the loss of the kal kan dog food business may necessitate the closure of certain pet distribution centers 
central entered into a master services agreement in may pursuant to which kal kan foods  inc granted central exclusive nationwide distribution rights for certain of its pet food products 
under the agreement  central s duties included providing account servicing support to kal kan in its direct sell program to petsmart as well as the right to distribute the same products on a buy sell basis to independent pet supply retailers throughout the united states  with certain exceptions 
effective november  kal kan terminated its distribution relationship with pet products 
the gross profit associated with these sales in fiscal was approximately million 
the loss of the kal kan business contributed to the decision to close two smaller pet branches during the first quarter of fiscal with a third facility closure planned for february if we are unable to offset the loss of gross profit as a result of the termination through expense reductions and other business growth  our operating income would be adversely impacted and we may be required to close additional underutilized pet distribution centers
