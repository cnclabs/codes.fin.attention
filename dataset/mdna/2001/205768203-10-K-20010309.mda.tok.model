liquidity and capital resources funding for the company s activities has historically been provided by operating cash flow  debt and equity financings and asset dispositions 
in  the company s net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million before changes to other working capital accounts 
the other primary funding source in was borrowings of million under the company s revolving bank credit facility 
the company s primary needs for capital  in addition to funding of ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of oil and gas properties and the repayment of debt 
in  the company incurred capital expenditures of million primarily for development  exploration and acquisition activities and reduced amounts outstanding under its bank credit facility by million 
the company s annual capital expenditure activity is summarized as follows year ended december  acquisitions of oil and gas properties    other leasehold costs    workovers and recompletions    offshore production facilities   development drilling    exploratory drilling    other total    the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary with no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company spent million  million and million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
the company currently anticipates spending approximately million on development and exploration projects in the company intends to primarily use internally generated cash flow to fund capital expenditures other than significant acquisitions 
the company spent million  million and million on acquisition activities in  and respectively 
the company does not have a specific acquisition budget for as a result of the unpredictability of the timing and size of forthcoming acquisition activities 
the company intends to use borrowings under its bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance significant acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to the financial condition and performance of the company  and some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and gas prices and other market conditions 
the company has a bank credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit commitment provided by a syndicate of banks for which bank one  na serves as administrative agent 
indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and is subject to borrowing base availability which is generally redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of the company s oil and gas properties 
the borrowing base under the bank credit facility is currently million 
such borrowing base may be affected from time to time by the performance of the company s oil and gas properties and changes in oil and gas prices 
the determination of the company s borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
the revolving credit line under the bank credit facility bears interest at the option of the company  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at either i libor plus to or ii the corporate base rate plus to 
the company incurs a commitment fee  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  of to per annum on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
as of december   million was outstanding under the bank credit facility 
the revolving credit line matures on december  or such earlier date as the company may elect 
the bank credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidated debt  and limit the company s ability to make certain loans and investments 
significant financial covenants include the maintenance of a current ratio  as defined  to  maintenance of tangible net worth million  and maintenance of an interest coverage ratio to the company believes that cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the company s bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund its operations and future growth as contemplated under its current business plan 
however  if the company s plans or assumptions change or if its assumptions prove to be inaccurate  the company may be required to seek additional capital 
management cannot be assured that the company will be able to obtain such capital or  if such capital is available  that the company will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
federal taxation at december   the company had federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million

year year  or the ability of computer systems to process dates with years beyond  affects almost all companies and organizations 
computer systems that were not year compliant by january  may cause an adverse effect to companies and organizations that rely upon those systems 
the company assessed and corrected computer systems that were unable to properly process dates beyond the company s significant financial information systems are outsourced and the company is relying on assurances from the providers that they are year compliant 
the company s costs related to year have not been significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company s operations are impacted by fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe the company s strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
oil and natural gas prices the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that the company can produce economically 
any reduction in oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on the company s ability to obtain capital for its exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on the company s oil and natural gas production in  before taking into account any hedging transactions  a change in the price per barrel of oil would result in a change in the company s cash flow for such period of approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would result in a change in the company s cash flow of approximately million 
the company periodically has utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of its oil and natural gas production to mitigate its exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
the company has primarily used price swaps  whereby monthly settlements are based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of certain futures contracts quoted on the nymex or certain other indices 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  the company receives a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price is higher than the specified price  the company pays the counterparty based on the difference 
during  the company did not hedge any of its oil and natural gas production 
as of december   the company had no open derivative financial instruments held for price risk management 
interest rates at december   the company had long term debt of million  of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount as of the closing day of the remaining outstanding long term debt of million is under the company s bank credit facility which is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor or the corporate base rate  at the company s option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flow 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on a large portion of its floating rate debt for part of as a result of the interest rate swaps in place  the company realized gains of million in as of december   the company had no open derivative financing instruments held for interest rate management 
new accounting pronouncement in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which has been amended by sfas and sfas the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards that are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  which require that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
such derivatives are reported at cost  if any  and gains and losses on such derivatives are reported when the hedged transaction occurs 
accordingly  if the company uses derivatives in the future  sfas will have an impact on the reported financial position and comprehensive income of the company
