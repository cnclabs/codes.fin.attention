in addition to the acquisition of valence  during the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  the company acquired two additional technologies 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain rights to voice intelligibility processor vip  a patented voice processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice  especially in high ambient noise environments 
in the following quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain rights to circle surround  a patented audio delivery system that allows multi channel surround sound to be encoded into a two channel stereo format and allows an encoded two channel audio source to be decoded into a multi channel surround format 
during fiscal  the company developed its srswowcast website thereby launching its internet based business 
initially  srswowcast s business plan was focused on developing and acquiring audio based content to generate and retain visitor traffic to its website in order to sell advertising and e commerce products 
recently  the company changed its internet strategy to focus on the licensing of the company s audio and voice enhancement technology solutions for internet streaming  g wireless  voice over internet protocol voip and telephony applications 
key business developments in fiscal in march  microsoft corporation microsoft and the company entered into a strategic alliance relating to the company s wow tm technology 
in connection with this alliance  microsoft purchased  shares of the company s common stock for per share or  received warrants to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock  warrants to purchase common stock of srswowcast and received licensing rights to include wow in any of their products for a three year term 
as a result of this alliance  microsoft embedded the company s wow technology into their newest generation windows media player and placed the srs logo and wow controls directly on the media player interface 
the technology was prominently featured with a media player interface in the form of the srs labs logo that hyperlinks to the company s technology page in the srswowcast website 
placement of the srs logo on the media player marks an unprecedented move by microsoft to feature third party logos on the media player while microsoft was incorporating the company s wow technology in the windows media player  the company s internet technology subsidiary began to develop its srswowcast website and the technology page that is directly linked from the srs logo on the media player 
both media player and the srswowcast website launched simultaneously on july  the company s technology receives significant exposure to current and prospective licensing customers due to the alliance with microsoft and the srswowcast website continues to receive over  unique visitors per month to the technology page as a result of the media player link 
in addition  the microsoft media player with wow is included in the windows me operating system and the wow technology is currently in the beta version of the microsoft windows media player valence continued to execute on the previous year s strategy to de emphasize lower margin distribution activities in favor of higher margin  award winning asic chip design business and general purpose branded chip products 
valence also began work on developing its own digital signal processor dsp during fiscal that will support the company s audio and voice technologies

the company s internet based business generated insignificant revenues in fiscal see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional discussion relating to the company s revenues for the periods indicated 
for fiscal  a single customer  std manufacturing  accounted for of the company s consolidated revenues and of its chip and licensing revenues 
technology solutions and licensing design and sale of integrated circuits the company  through valence  designs and sells custom analog  digital and mixed signal asics for oem customers worldwide 
applications for these asics include consumer audio and video electronic products  internet appliances  electronic educational toys  video game players  car audio systems  set top boxes  video compact disc vcd and dvd players  smart cards  cordless telephone sets  speakers  digital power amplifiers  and pagers 
based in the prc and hong kong  over engineers  with state of the art equipment and software  support valence s custom chip design capabilities 
valence sells these custom designed chips to its contracted customers  outsourcing the manufacturing to a network of fabrication partners throughout asia pacific  including chartered semiconductor  samsung and tower semiconductor limited in israel 
as of december and  the backlog of orders for asic design work to non affiliated parties was  and  respectively 
the company expects that all or substantially all of the current backlog orders for fiscal will be completed in fiscal valence s asic customers include industry leading consumer electronics  telecommunications  game and personal computer manufacturers in north america and europe  as well as in asia pacific 
due to nondisclosure agreements  specific current customers cannot be disclosed  but previous design projects have been performed for such international companies as creative technology limited  innovision research and technology limited  national semiconductor corporation  raytron inc  toshiba corporation  system lsi division and utron technology inc under many of the design contracts  valence negotiates to retain ownership of the specific designs 
these designs form a significant library of intellectual property that can be used in future projects 
in addition to performing contract design work  valence designs  produces and sells integrated circuits ics to oems of consumer electronics  games  telecommunication and personal computer equipment in asia pacific under the brand name asp 
the general purpose integrated circuits offered include micro controllers with eprom and roms for dvd players  set top box receivers and audio video equipment  ics for telecommunication and game equipment  small signal transistors and ics used mainly in the manufacture of consumer products such as television sets  radios  telephones  computer mother boards  add on boards and audio hi fi systems 
the products created are based upon management s analysis of trends in the market  knowledge gained from long standing relationships with customers and overall business experience 
many of these products are developed by capitalizing upon valence s custom design libraries 
currently  a dsp is under development by valence to be sold under their own brand name which will be compatible with srs labs audio and voice technologies thus providing a total audio or voice solution to both valence and srs labs customers 
this dsp is expected to be available in the second half of technologies and licensing the company s technology portfolio covers a wide range of audio  voice and speaker technologies 
the company licenses these technologies to product and semiconductor manufacturers  as well as develops and markets implementation options and finished goods that feature these proprietary and patented technologies 
the company s technology strategy continues to be the development  acquisition and licensing of audio and voice technologies to product and semiconductor manufacturers in the consumer electronics  home theater  computer  game  internet  voice  wireless and telecommunications markets around the world 
by providing a continuous stream of patented audio and voice technologies  enhancing relationships with existing licensees and creating a strong brand awareness in order to attract new licensees  the company believes that it will strengthen its market position as a world leader in audio and voice technology 
the company s technologies may be implemented in a variety of methods  including discrete analog components  chip modules  analog semiconductors  dsp s and software 
these various implementation options offer customers significant flexibility when incorporating the company s technologies into products 
the markets which the company s technologies address include a wide variety of audio and voice related consumer products such as tvs  computers  stereo receivers  dvd  mp and cd players  vcrs  video games  musical instruments  cellular phones  cordless phones  voice portals  public address equipment and car audio equipment 
the markets for these consumer electronics products are highly competitive and generally dominated by large manufacturers 
the company provides technology to these manufacturers who need to differentiate their products by continually adding new features and increasing product performance 
license agreements for the company s technologies have terms that typically range from one to ten years and require per unit royalty payments for all products implementing the company s technologies 
certain agreements provide for a fixed annual or quarterly royalty payment instead of a per unit payment 
license agreements also specify the use of the company s trademarks and logos on the front of the product  within the packaging and in the user s manual 
agreements also require product review and approval by the company to guarantee the quality of the technology implementation and the display of company logos and trademark verbiage 
this ensures that quality and the company s brand awareness is elevated in the marketplace 
the agreements do not have volume requirements and may be terminated by the licensees or the company without substantial financial penalty 
the company s licensing model most often employs a two tiered system whereby semiconductor manufacturers are licensed to build and sell semiconductor implementations of the company s technology solutions 
these semiconductor technology solutions are then sold by the semiconductor licensees to consumer product manufacturers 
the consumer product manufacturers also enter into licensing arrangements with the company for the use of its technology solutions and display of the company s trademarks 
under this two tiered licensing method  consumer product licensees are free to choose a semiconductor solution from a number of choices that best suit their requirements and matches their price expectations 
the company receives royalties from the use of its technologies by a consumer product manufacturer either directly by the consumer product manufacturer or by the semiconductor licensee 
many major consumer product manufacturers having licenses for the use of one or more of the company s technologies pay royalties directly to the company 
however  this methodology is not well established in the computer multimedia industry or the prc consumer electronics marketplace 
to address these market conditions  the company implements an alternate royalty collection method  whereby the royalty is bundled into the cost of the semiconductor product and remitted to the company when the semiconductor product is sold to the consumer product manufacturer 
this methodology simplifies the business process for the consumer product manufacturer  the semiconductor manufacturer and the company 
under this model  the royalty is remitted directly to the company by the semiconductor manufacturer after the chip has been delivered to the product manufacturer 
the company determines which licensing model to follow based on factors involving mutual discussions with the semiconductor and consumer product manufacturing licensees  the particular market segment involved  the particular region where the products are manufactured and sold and or other factors 
portfolio of audio and voice technologies the portfolio of audio  voice and speaker technologies developed or acquired by the company includes srs r  trusurround  focus r  baser r  orb r  avt tm  vip tm  circle surround r cs  srs headphone tm  trubass tm  wow tm  wowvoice tm and nuvoice tm 
these technologies are described below 
srs  trusurround and focus are currently the subject of numerous license agreements and are actively marketed by the company 
baser and orb  speaker technologies that were included in the original technology acquisition from hughes  and avt have not been actively promoted 
vip and cs  acquired during the first and second quarters of fiscal  respectively  saw marketing efforts begin to generate license agreements starting in fiscal leading to revenue contributions for fiscal srs headphone  wow  and trubass were developed internally and were introduced to the marketplace in fiscal but have not yet contributed significantly to revenues 
licensing royalties associated with srs  trusurround  focus  vip  cs and technology transfer fees for new technologies have accounted for virtually all of the company s licensing revenues to date 
more background information concerning the company s technology portfolio follows 

srs d sound srs d sound is one of the world s leading d audio enhancement technologies 
the patented technology broadens any mono or stereo audio signal and creates a realistic d sound image from just two standard stereo speakers 
srs is based on the fundamentals of the human hearing system and recreates the multitude of spatial cues that are present in a live listening environment but are lost in recording and playback 
srs dramatically widens the sweet spot associated with traditional stereo  therefore does not require the listener to be positioned in a specific location to experience the immersive d sound image 
it is commonly used in television sets providing each member of the family sitting in different parts of a room with a virtual surround sound listening experience 
the technology can also be encoded onto cds  cassettes or videotapes during the recording process and reproduced through a conventional stereo system  multimedia computer  radio and television broadcast  or the internet 
srs was originally developed by hughes  which spent significant resources to develop and patent srs and related audio technologies 
since acquiring the srs technology from hughes in june  the company has improved the performance of srs  reduced the cost for oems to implement the technology  secured licensing relationships with various semiconductor manufacturers who offer the technology in various analog and digital chip options  and introduced the technology to a wider variety of consumer applications 
to date  products have been shipped with srs technology from more than manufacturers including acer peripherals  ltd  daewoo telecom ltd  hitachi ltd  ibm  kawai musical instruments mfg 
co  ltd  kenwood corporation  young chang america  inc kurzweil  lg electronics  inc  packard bell nec  pioneer electronic corporation  thomson consumer electronics  inc rca  thompson multimedia  sa  samsung  sharp electronics corporation  smart devices  inc  sony corporation and toshiba corporation 
semiconductor manufacturers who have included srs technology in their chip offerings include cirrus logic crystal semiconductor  fujitsu semiconductor corporation  mitsubishi electric corporation  new japan radio co 
ltd  philips semiconductors  st microelectronics  toshiba semiconductor corporation and zoran corporation 

trusurround trusurround is a dolby certified virtual audio technology  which takes audio from a multi channel audio source  such as dolby digital or dolby pro logic and creates an immersive surround sound listening experience from just two standard speakers 
it was originally designed to take advantage of the channel audio standard for dvd  dolby digital  without requiring the use of six speakers 
trusurround processes the six discrete channels of digital audio into just two channels  retaining all of the original audio information and giving listeners the perception that they are surrounded by additional phantom speakers 
this technology is useful in televisions and set top boxes because much of the satellite and cable programming is being broadcast in multi channel formats 
trusurround takes advantage of that encoded information and creates a much more immersive  home theater like experience without the need for additional speakers 
trusurround has been successfully introduced to the consumer electronics marketplace and is featured in a wide variety of products  including televisions from sony corporation and dvd players from pioneer electronic corporation and philips consumer electronics bv semiconductor companies who have offered trusurround in analog or digital implementation options for various applications in consumer electronics have included akm semiconductor  broadcom corporation  new japan radio co  ltd  st microelectronics  mitsubishi electric corporation and zoran corporation 

focus in many audio environments  speakers are not placed in an ideal location directly in front of a listener 
this makes it difficult to achieve a realistic sound experience from speakers that are below the plane of the listener s ear 
the company developed focus as a technology solution for this problem 
originally designed for use in automobiles where front speakers are often placed under the dashboard or facing each other in the door panels  the patented focus technology electronically repositions the sound image to create the appropriate perception of image height 
in addition to automobiles  focus is ideally suited for any product application where speakers cannot be placed in optimal locations for either space or aesthetic reasons  such as big screen or projection tvs  home in wall speakers and commercial applications such as drive through restaurant communications 
the first analog and digital chip options of focus became available for sampling to oems beginning in the last half of fiscal from mitsubishi electric corporation  new japan radio co  ltd 
and st microelectronics 
to date  focus has been successfully incorporated into consumer electronics products marketed by hitachi limited and marantz japan  inc 
speaker technologies the company holds patents for speaker technologies originally developed at hughes 
one such technology  orb  provides a unique approach to the physical design of speakers by incorporating a baffle that creates a degrees dispersion of sound 
a second speaker technology developed by hughes  baser  is a high efficiency design for a subwoofer product 
another speaker technology  referred to as avt  projects the listening material so that the human ear can more easily identify the direction of ambient sounds 
to date  no significant commercial applications involving these speaker technologies have been developed 

vip voice intelligibility processor technology vip is a patented audio processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice especially in noisy environments or in text to speech applications 
vip selectively processes only those spectral portions of the speech signal that the brain uses for cognition  without requiring increase in gain or volume 
srs inventor arnold klayman  who is now the principal audio scientist at the company  originally developed the vip technology at hughes 
during a divestiture in  hughes sold this non core business division to vip labs 
from until the acquisition by the company  vip labs further developed the technology as well as selectively marketed a stand alone signal processor for use in the professional sound reinforcement industry 
the company believes that the market opportunities for vip are significant and include cellular phones  wireless products  text to speech applications  hearing aids  public address and emergency warning systems  talking toys  hands free devices  voip  traditional and internet broadcasting and other voice related applications 
the company directly offers both software and hardware implementation options for vip 
vip technology is available as digital code that may be ported to dsp chips used by manufacturers of cellular phones  paging systems  digital televisions  sound reinforcement equipment and hearing aids 
the company announced the porting of this technology to a popular dsp platform in february and march  the ti tmscx and x generations which provide a simple solution to add vip into products already on that platform 
vip is also available in software and can run on client or server side applications 
to date the company has licensed vip for use by samsung and lucent technologies 
samsung has also successfully implemented vip in a semiconductor chip targeted at the cellular and traditional telephone applications 
in fiscal  the samsung cellular phone shipped into the korean marketplace and the company also discovered capabilities for vip in the text to speech marketplace 
the company began to expand the marketing of vip in the fourth quarter of fiscal and expects to see additional opportunities for this technology in future periods 

circle surround cs is a patented  multi channel encoding and decoding audio technology designed to encode five discrete channels into two channels the same space required for stereo and then decode the two channels back into five for playback over a stereo or home theater system equipped for multi channel playback 
cs is significantly unique to the market because it enables new audio applications allowing the delivery of surround sound audio into new products and formats in an effective and efficient manner that has not been done before 
the versatility of cs is demonstrated by the fact that it is backward compatible and can produce up to channels from any mono or stereo material 
as a result  consumers who own home theater speaker systems can enjoy listening to all of the speakers in a multi channel mode while watching television or vhs movies or listening to music cds 
cs also is compatible with dolby encoded material 
one of the most interesting applications is that cs can stream multi channel audio for movies  trailers  music videos  games and other content over the internet without increasing the bandwidth 
it requires about kbs and sends the information in stereo format allowing end users the option to listen through a multi channel speaker system using a cs decoding device or software 
cs can be used in the recording process for music or movies or in the development of games for computers or video game consoles and then implemented in a decoding playback device  such as a home audio receiver  multi media speakers  dvd player or car audio product 
when used as an encoding decoding technology  cs encodes five discrete channels of sound through only two channels the same space required for stereo 
in the playback device  cs then takes the two channels of encoded material and decodes them back into the original five recorded channels for playback through a multi channel surround sound home theater or cinema system equipped with four or five speakers plus subwoofer 
in addition  cs creates multiple channel surround sound from the wealth of legacy stereo and surround encoded material available on traditional music cds  vhs tapes  television or am fm broadcasts 
in fiscal  the company demonstrated cs s game encoding capabilities and is pursuing game encoding relationships to further the technologies use in the game market 
cs technology is available for product manufacturers worldwide in the following formats analog ics through a relationship with analog devices  dsp implementations from cirrus logic and akm  digital software code from the company  and reference boards  sub systems and finished products for the home and car audio market from valence

wowvoice and nuvoice in fiscal  the company introduced two new technologies  wowvoice tm and nuvoice tm 
these technologies are part of the technology offering based on the company s vip technology and is specifically designed for telephone voice quality and intelligibility and text to speech enhancement applications 
vip alone increases the intelligibility of voice  particularly in noisy listening environments and dramatically improves the quality and clarity of synthesized speech in text to speech applications see vip description above for more details 
nuvoice adds warmth to voice and speech restoring the lower bass frequencies oftentimes cut off or lost in the transmission or compression of the telephony bandwidth 
it overcomes the physical limitations of small transducers found in cellular and traditional telephones by producing lower bass tones using psycho acoustics and harmonic principles to make the speech sound more realistic  closer to the original human speech before it was sent over the telephony equipment 
nuvoice also improves the quality of text to speech engines making synthesized voices sound more natural 
when nuvoice is added to vip  the resulting suite of voice technology is called wow voice 
the company began actively marketing these technologies in the third and fourth quarter of and continue to refine the technology based on needs found in the marketplace

competition the company competes in each of its business segments with a number of companies that produce a variety of audio and voice enhancement technologies  processes and products 
these technologies  processes and products include thx r  a certification program that indicates if a movie theater or particular piece of audio equipment meets certain specifications  dolby r a type  b type and c type noise reduction  dolby sr r  which provides noise reduction and encodes analog sound using four sound channels  prologich tm and prologicii  surround sound systems incorporating an active center channel  dolbysrd r  which encodes a six channel digital sound track on a movie print  dts r  which uses cds to reproduce six channels of digital sound synchronized with a movie print  and sdds r  which encodes six or eight channels of digital sound on both sides of a movie print 
because srs works with any existing recorded material whether mono  stereo  surround sound or other encoding process  srs can be used either as an alternative or as a complement and enhancement to almost any competing audio technology 
as a multi channel encode decode technology  circle surround competes more directly with the various surround sound technologies listed above 
the company also directly competes in the field of d audio enhancement with other d audio providers  including qsound labs  inc and spatializer 
the company is not aware of any direct competing technologies to its voice intelligibility technology  vip 
the company believes that trubass might directly compete with several technologies that are included on a variety of electronics products  including televisions  audio systems and speaker products 
in addition  the company s technologies may  in the future  compete with audio technologies developed by other companies  some of whom may be current licensees of the company 
certain of these companies referenced above have  or may have  substantially greater resources than the company to devote to further technologies and new product developments 
the company believes that it will compete based primarily on the quality and performance of its proprietary technologies  brand name awareness  the ease and cost of implementing its technologies  the ability to meet oems needs to differentiate their products  and the strength of its licensee relationships including the relationship with microsoft 
there can be no assurance that based on these factors the company will continue to be competitive with existing or future products or technologies of its competitors 
the company s competitors to its semiconductor ic business are primarily fabless semiconductor design houses and manufacturers located in taiwan  japan and korea 
given that taiwan is focusing on the development of the personal computer industry  most of the fabless semiconductor design houses in taiwan also focus on the design of dynamic random access memory  static random access memory and semiconductors for personal computer applications 
these fabless semiconductor design houses focus less on semiconductors for consumer electronics such as home audio and video products  communications equipment and electronic games players 
although the chinese semiconductor industry is dominated by several major chip suppliers  such as motorola  national semiconductor and texas instruments  within every major market there is need for local  niche participants  such as the company 
generally speaking  established semiconductor companies do not offer semiconductor design services to manufacturers and will only do so if the number of semiconductors required by such manufacturers is very large 
instead  they supply standard semiconductors to such manufacturers 
these standard semiconductors may not be the most suitable components for the manufacturers as they may require additional semiconductor components to perform the designed functions required in their products 
in such cases  these semiconductors will be bulkier  heavier and more expensive compared to one custom designed system on chip asic 
the company s asic team is more flexible in its strategy of designing new products  as well as more responsive and flexible in the service provided to clients 
with fifteen years of background in the chinese semiconductor market  the company s personnel has expertise in local business practices and a strong franchise of relationships with clients that the company believes gives it a competitive advantage over newcomers to the industry or the large multi national firms 
the company s through valence and its subsidiaries chip and component distribution contracts to distribute products for third party semiconductor manufacturers in the domestic chinese market are not exclusive  and the company competes with other distributors  such as arrow electronics  future electronics and avnet inc in addition  the semiconductor companies who manufacture the components and chips also sell directly to manufacturers within the prc 
dvd and vcd have become and will continue to be the standard video format and have received mass market adoption in the prc 
through its distribution agreements and close relationships with leading digital video chip suppliers  such as philips hong kong ltd  the company designs  develops and markets complete dvd and vcd players  as well as assembly kits and reference boards for use in audio products  dvd players and telecommunication and wireless infrastructure equipment 
although the overall consumer electronics market in the prc is vast  it is highly competitive with many large manufacturers competing in the retail channel with established brand names 
the markets in which the company sells its products are subject to extreme price competition  thus the company expects to continue to experience declines in the selling prices of its products over the life cycle of each product 
in order to offset declines in the selling prices of its products  the company must continue to reduce the costs of products through product design changes  manufacturing process changes  volume discounts and other savings negotiated with its manufacturing subcontractors 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facilities with respect to asics or product or component sales  it may not be able to reduce its costs as rapidly as its competitors who perform their own manufacturing 
the failure of the company to design and introduce  in a timely manner  lower cost versions of existing products or higher gross margin new products  or to successfully manage its manufacturing subcontractor relationships could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margins 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information the company operates in industries where innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of its resulting intellectual property rights are important for success 
the company relies on a variety of intellectual property protections for its products and services  including patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and contractual obligations  and pursues a policy of enforcing such rights 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s intellectual property rights will be adequate to ensure the company s competitive position  or that competitors will not be able to produce a non infringing competitive product or service 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  or that if required to obtain any third party licenses as a result of an infringement dispute the company will be able to obtain such licenses 
although the company believes that its patents and trademarks are important to each of its business segments  such patents and trademarks are especially important to the chip and licensing business segment 
in order to protect the underlying technology concepts  the company has filed and or obtained patents for all of its marketed technologies including technologies marketed under the trademarks srs  trusurround  focus  circle surround  wow  vip and trubass 
in addition  the company has numerous issued patents and patents pending for speaker and other acoustic reproduction technologies 
the company pursues a general practice of filing patent applications for its technologies in the united states and various foreign countries where its licensees manufacture  distribute or sell licensed products 
the company continually updates and adds new applications to its patent portfolio to address changing worldwide market conditions and new technological innovations of the company 
the range of expiration dates for the company s patents extend between the year to the company has multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of its technologies 
accordingly  the expiration of any single patent is not likely to affect the company s intellectual property position or the ability to generate licensing revenue 
the company s strategy for protection of its trademarks identifying the various company technology solutions is commensurate with its strategy for obtaining patent protection 
specifically  the company routinely files us federal and foreign trademark applications for the various word names and logos used to market its technology solutions to licensees and the general public 
the duration of the us and foreign registered trademarks can typically be maintained indefinitely  provided proper maintenance fees are paid and trademarks are continually used or licensed by the company 
seasonality due to the company s dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact the company s revenues and net income 
in particular  the company believes that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season as well as the chinese new year in the asia pacific region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters  respectively 
employees the company employed persons and persons  respectively  in its chip and licensing and its product and component sales business segments as of december  of the aggregate number of employees  are employed by valence and its subsidiaries and are located overseas

through its majority owned subsidiary  srswowcast  developing audio and voice enhancement technology solutions dedicated to the internet and telecommunications markets  and 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  valence  designing and selling technology solutions through custom asics to oems  and designing  distributing and manufacturing components  sub assemblies and finished goods for targeted markets within selected oem and retail communities 
from the company s inception in until february  the company derived substantially all of its revenue from royalties received from technology licenses 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of valence  a british virgin islands holding company with its principal business operations in hong kong and the prc for an aggregate purchase price  excluding non compete agreements and acquisition costs  of  consisting of approximately  in cash and approximately  shares of the company s common stock  
par value per share the common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with an effective date of february  the acquisition of valence had a material impact on the company s financial statements subsequent to february accordingly  current and future financial statements may not be directly comparable to the company s historical financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain rights to vip  which is a patented voice processing technology that improves the intelligibility of the spoken voice  especially in high ambient noise environments 
aggregate consideration  including acquisition costs  was  and was comprised of  in cash   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired certain rights to circle surround  a patented audio delivery system that allows multi channel surround sound to be encoded into a two channel stereo format and allows an encoded two channel audio source or a traditional stereo audio source to be decoded into a multi channel surround format 
the aggregate purchase price  including acquisition costs  was  and was comprised of  in cash and  shares of common stock 
the company operates in three business segments a the development and marketing of technology either in the form of integrated circuits through valence asics or the licensing of technologies developed by the company to oems and semiconductor manufacturers  b the sale of consumer electronic products and components  and c the srswowcast internet based business 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and percentage of total revenue years ended december  chip and licensing revenue product and component sales total revenue cost of sales gross margin sales and marketing research and development general and administrative non cash stock issuance cost acquired in process research and development total operating expense operating loss other income  net minority interest loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues chip and licensing revenue consists of design fees and sales of asics by valence to oem manufacturers and sales of general purpose ics designed by the company under the brand name asp microelectronics 
licensing revenues are royalties generated primarily from the license of the company s audio and voice technologies 
license and royalty agreements generally provide for the license of technologies for a specified period of time for either a single fee or a fee based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
product and component sales represent a the manufacture and sale of valence s own branded product line of vcd players  amplifiers and game products and b the distribution of semiconductor products  manufacturing components and sub assemblies to oems for the hong kong and the prc markets 
total revenues for fiscal were  consisting of chip and licensing revenue of  and product and component revenue of  this contrasts with fiscal  where chip and licensing revenues were  and product and component revenues were  both categories of chip and licensing revenue decreased from the same period last year with licensing revenue decreasing by and revenue from custom asic chip design and chip sales related to valence s activities decreasing by 
these decreases were due to a continued general weakness in the asian markets leading to reduced demand for consumer electronics products in the region which negatively impacted the sales of semiconductor ics that include the company s audio technologies and the trend by consumer electronic manufacturers to initially adopt the company s new technologies into higher end models resulting in limited volume potential for the short term 
product and component revenues decreased by from the same prior year period which is consistent with the company s decision to focus on higher margin chip and licensing revenues and de emphasize certain lower margin distribution activities 
revenues generated by the company s internet based business were not significant during fiscal gross margin cost of sales consists primarily of component cost  fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
gross margin for fiscal increased to as a percentage of total revenue from for the same period in the increase resulted primarily from the company s decision to focus the revenue base towards higher margin chip and licensing sales and away from lower margin component distribution 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions and product promotion costs 
sales and marketing expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is attributable primarily to spending associated with the development and promotion of the srswowcast website and creation of program content for the website 
effective february   srswowcast discontinued efforts to develop program content to focus on utilizing the website to promote the licensing of the company s audio and voice technology solutions 
although this should reduce sales and marketing expenditures related to the srswowcast business  management believes sales and marketing expenditures will continue to be a significant component of operating costs in the future to promote the adoption of the company s technology in new and existing markets 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs for engineering materials and supplies 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to expenses related to srswowcast  offset partially by a reduction in staffing levels at valence 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal management believes that research and development expenses will increase in the future as a result of the company s ongoing product development efforts including activity related to the expansion of consumer products incorporating the company s audio and voice technologies 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  legal costs associated with the administration of intellectual property  professional fees and various other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily due to compensation costs incurred as a result of the resignation of an employee of valence  accelerated amortization of intellectual property incorporating obsolete or unpursued technologies  higher legal and employee related expenses associated with the launch of srswowcast  expenses related to the postponed valence ipo  plus higher salaries and benefits  legal  and other administrative expenses in the company s core licensing business 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal on march   the company filed an application to list the common shares of valence on the gem  in order to sell a minority interest in valence to the public 
the initial public offering was targeted for completion in the second quarter of however  due to negative market conditions affecting equity markets worldwide  including the gem  the company elected not to proceed with the offering 
offering costs incurred by the company  comprised primarily of legal  accounting and underwriting fees  totaled  as of december  these costs are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying financial statements 
non cash stock issuance cost in march  the company entered into a technology and marketing alliance with microsoft 
in conjunction with this transaction  microsoft purchased shares of common stock of the company and was issued warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock of the company and of its subsidiary  srswowcast together referred to as the microsoft transaction 
as a result of the microsoft transaction  the company recognized a one time  non cash charge totaling  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the microsoft transaction 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense  realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses at valence 
net interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributable to higher average cash and investment balances during the current year as compared to the prior year due partly to the  received in the microsoft investment 
minority interest minority interest represents the minority shareholders proportionate share of losses in srswowcast 
losses in srswowcast are expected to continue as a result of expenditures exceeding revenues in an effort to support the expansion and growth of srswowcast business operations 
should losses continue in srswowcast  the minority interest adjustment in the consolidated statement of operations will continue to reduce the company s net losses by the minority shareholders proportionate share of srswowcast s net losses to the extent of their investment 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the higher tax expense in fiscal was primarily a result of valence fully utilizing tax loss carry forwards during fiscal resulting in higher income tax expense and the company recognizing a tax benefit in fiscal primarily due to a taxable loss recognized for us federal income tax purposes related to domestic operations 
in addition  the company benefited from certain tax credits and statutory tax rates in the asian countries where valence has its principal business operations which are lower than united states statutory rates 
the company had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards at december   of approximately  and  respectively 
these net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in and  respectively 
in addition  the company has federal tax credit carry forwards of approximately  which will begin to expire in as of december   a valuation allowance of approximately  has been provided based on the company s assessment of the future realizability of certain deferred tax assets 
approximately  of the valuation allowance is attributable to the potential tax benefit of stock option transactions that will be credited directly to additional paid in capital  if realized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  impact of valence acquisition the company s consolidated financial results for fiscal include the results of the valence operations beginning as of february  accordingly  results for the year ended december  may not be directly comparable to results for the year ended december  revenues total revenues for fiscal were  consisting of chip and licensing revenue of  and product and component revenue of  this contrasts with fiscal  where chip and licensing revenues were  and product and component revenues were  excluding chip design revenue  licensing revenue decreased from the same period last year due to the following factors a the shift in the pc market to lower cost models which cannot bear the cost of performance enhancement technologies such as those offered by srs labs  b the reduced growth rate of the prc economy which reduced demand for consumer electronics products in the region and negatively impacted the sales of semiconductor ics that include the company s audio technologies  and c the trend by consumer electronic manufacturers to initially adopt the company s new technologies into their higher end models with limited volume potential for the short term 
revenue from custom asic chip design and chip sales related to valence s activities increased from the same period last year primarily due to the company s decision to focus on higher margin chip and licensing revenues and de emphasize certain lower margin distribution activities 
the decrease in product and component revenues in fiscal also is due to the company s decision to de emphasize certain lower margin distribution activities 
gross margin gross margin for fiscal increased to as a percentage of total revenue from for the same period in the increase resulted primarily from the shift in the company s revenue base towards higher margin chip and licensing sales and away from lower margin component distribution 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
this decrease is attributable primarily to lower advertising  promotional  trade show and travel costs  resulting from the company s efforts during to reduce costs in these areas 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development research and development expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is primarily attributable to asic related research and development  and design and development of asp branded products based on srs technologies 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was primarily attributable to headcount added to support new business development  costs incurred for due diligence activities related to potential acquisitions  and costs incurred to reserve for certain non collectible accounts receivable 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as part of the valence acquisition  the company allocated a portion of the purchase price to various intangible assets totaling approximately  this amount was capitalized and is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to eleven years with the related amortization expense of  and  included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal and  respectively 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the purchase price allocation associated with the valence acquisition 
acquired in process research and development the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes the one time charge of  for the write off of acquired r d expenses associated with the valence acquisition and the acquisition of certain assets associated with the vip technology 
the acquired r d expenses arose from new product projects that were under development at the date of the acquisition and expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
the valuation of the acquired r d projects was based upon the discounted expected future net cash flows of the products over the products expected lives  reflecting the estimated stages of completion of the projects and the estimated costs to complete the projects 
new product development projects underway at valence at the time of the valence acquisition included  among others  asics for consumer electronics  computing and voice and audio applications  home entertainment systems  digital multimedia players and digital power amplifiers 
the company estimated that these projects were approximately complete at the date of acquisition and estimated that the cost to complete these projects will aggregate approximately million and will be incurred over a three year period 
new product development projects utilizing the vip technology at the time of the vip acquisition included  among others  digital and analog sound reinforcement  wireless and non wireless telecommunications applications  hearing aid applications and headphone and microphone applications 
the company estimated that these projects were approximately complete at the date of acquisition and estimated that the cost to complete these projects will aggregate approximately  and will be incurred over a two year period 
uncertainties that could impede the progress of converting a development project to a developed technology include the availability of financial resources to complete the project  failure of the technology to function properly  continued economic feasibility of developed technologies  customer acceptance  customer demand and customer qualification of such new technology and general competitive conditions in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the acquired r d projects will be successfully completed and commercially introduced 
other income  net net interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower average cash and investment balances during fiscal as compared to the prior year due to the  paid in conjunction with the acquisitions of valence and vip and interest expense on the outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit obtained during fiscal provision for income taxes the income tax provision for fiscal was  compared to a benefit of  for fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit in fiscal primarily due to a taxable loss recognized for us federal income tax purposes related to domestic operations 
in addition  the company benefited from certain tax credits and statutory tax where valence has its principal business operations which are lower than united states statutory rates

factors that may affect future results quarterly fluctuations the company s operating results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to be subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the extent to which the company s licensees incorporate the company s technologies into their products  the timing of orders from  and the shipments to  major customers  the timing of new product introductions by the company  the gain or loss of significant customers  competitive pressures on selling prices  the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s technologies  the rate that the company s semiconductor licensees manufacture and distribute chips to product manufacturers  and fluctuations in general economic conditions  particularly those affecting the consumer electronics market 
due to the company s dependence on the consumer electronics market  the substantial seasonality of sales in the market could impact the company s revenues and net income 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company believes that there is seasonality relating to the christmas season as well as the chinese new year within the asia region  which fall into the fourth and first quarters  respectively 
valence s business the company derives a significant amount of its revenue from valence s asic and component distribution business 
valence s engineering team focuses on the design of custom asics to meet specific customers requirements and outsources the production of the design to mask houses  foundries and packaging houses located primarily in asia 
the operations of valence could be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  the timing of development revenue  changes in the mix of products distributed and the mix of distribution channels employed  the emergence of a new industry standard  product obsolescence and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers 
business revenue from asics is concentrated in a limited number of customers in the areas of consumer electronics  communications products  computers and computer peripherals 
as such  the loss of any such customers or any bad debt arising from them may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
beginning in fiscal  valence began to exit from certain lower margin product offerings in the distribution side of the business and has focused upon developing and distributing products that are related to or incorporate the company s proprietary technologies 
as a result  the immediate loss in revenue of the low margin distribution business will not be entirely offset by the new proprietary technology based products  which will take time to develop and be introduced into the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to quickly introduce new products to offset the loss in revenue or that the new products developed will receive a favorable market acceptance 
the public offering of common shares of valence in hong kong was intended to bring new capital to grow valence s core business while  at the same time  adding significant value to the company s shareholders 
the company s decision not to proceed with the offering is not expected to adversely affect valence s core business operations  and the company will continue to evaluate its financing options domestically and in foreign capital markets 
the acquisition of valence has added significant diversity to the company s overall business structure and the company s opportunities 
the company recognizes that in the presence of such corporate diversity  and in particular with regard to the semiconductor industry  there will always exist a potential for a conflict among sales channels between the company and certain of the company s technology licensees 
although the operations of the company s licensing business and those of valence are generally complementary  there can be no assurances that sales channel conflicts will not arise 
if such potential conflicts do materialize  the company may or may not be able to mitigate the effect of such perceived conflicts  which  if not resolved  may impact the results of operations 
internet business in fiscal  the company launched its internet business with the formation of srswowcast 
in fiscal srswowcast commenced operations with a business plan which focused on developing and acquiring audio based content to attract visitor traffic to its website in order to sell advertising and e commerce products 
in  the company changed its internet strategy to focus on licensing of the company s audio and voice enhancement technology solutions for internet streaming  g wireless  voip and telephony applications 
there can be no assurance that this new business model will develop a sufficient customer base to be able to generate meaningful revenue from their targeted markets 
product business in fiscal  the company developed and marketed on its e commerce site  www 
wowthing 
com  its first consumer audio product  the wow thing processor box 
the wow thing processor box enhances the sound quality of music downloaded over the internet as well as audio performance of computer and home entertainment products and speakers 
this was the company s first entry into the consumer market in the united states which is both competitive and demands products with short life cycles 
in fiscal  the company packaged the hardware and began to market two models wow thing for computers and wow thing for game consoles to consumers and resellers 
although the revenues from these product launches during fiscal were not significant  the product introductions did help to elevate the technology s brand awareness with the company s customers and with consumers 
the company intends to continue to expand its offerings of high end audio enhancement products in the year and beyond 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop an effective distribution channel and build acceptable brand recognition as a product manufacturer 
as the business increases  it is anticipated that significant capital will be required to finance product inventory and accounts receivable 
as a result  the company is subject to risks of product obsolescence  bad debt and insufficient finance to grow the business 
the company also recognizes that as new consumer audio products are developed and marketed by the company  there will always exist a potential for conflict and competition between the company and certain of the company s technology licensees 
although the intended products of the company and those of its licenses do not generally overlap  there can be no assurances that the company s products will not compete with those of their licensees 
if such conflicts do materialize  it is uncertain whether the company will be able to mitigate the effect of such conflicts  which  if not resolved  may adversely impact its business and results of operations 
economic risks associated with doing business in asia the company s significant operations in hong kong  the prc and other parts of asia have required  and will continue to require  refinement to adapt to the changing market conditions in the region 
the company s operations in asia  and international operations in general  are subject to risks of unexpected changes in  or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements 
the asian consumer electronics markets accounted for approximately  and of total company sales in  and  respectively and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of sales in the future 
the recent economic crisis in asia has been characterized by declines in consumer spending  currency devaluation  unemployment and bank failures 
any of these factors  should they continue  could significantly reduce the demand for the end user goods in which the company s products are used 
the prc economy has experienced significant growth in the past decade  but such growth has been uneven across geographic and economic sectors and has recently been slowing 
there can be no assurance that such growth will not continue to decrease or that any slow down will not have a negative effect on the company s business  including valence 
the prc economy has also experienced deflation in the past which may continue in the future 
the current economic situation may adversely affect the company s profitability over time as expenditures for consumer electronics products and information technology may decrease due to the results of slowing domestic demand and deflation 
hong kong is a special administrative region of the prc with its own government and legislature 
hong kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy from the prc under the principle of one country  two systems 
the company can give no assurance that hong kong will continue to enjoy autonomy from the prc 
the hong kong dollar has remained relative constant due to the us dollar peg and currency board system that has been in effect in hong kong since since mid  interest rates in hong kong have fluctuated significantly and real estate and retail sales have declined 
the company can give no assurance that the hong kong economy will not worsen or that the historical currency peg of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar will be maintained 
continued declining consumer spending in hong kong  deflation or the discontinuation of the currency peg could adversely affect the company s business 
currency risk stability of asian markets the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
to date  all of the company s licensing revenues have been denominated in us dollars and most costs have been incurred in us dollars 
it is the company s expectation that licensing revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
because valence and its subsidiaries business is primarily focused in asia and because of the company s anticipated expansion of its business in china and other parts of asia  the company s consolidated operations and financial results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities  including economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold 
in addition  the company s valuation of assets recorded as a result of the valence acquisition may also be adversely impacted by the currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
the company intends to actively monitor its foreign exchange exposure and to implement strategies to reduce its foreign exchange risk at such time that the company determines the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
however  there is no guarantee that the company will take steps to insure against such risks  and should such risks occur  there is no guarantee that the company will not be significantly impacted 
countries in the asia pacific region have experienced weakness in their currency  banking and equity markets 
these weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for valence s products  the us dollar value of the company s and its subsidiaries foreign currency denominated sales  the availability and supply of product components to valence and ultimately  the company s consolidated results of operations 
competitive pressures the company s existing and potential competitors include both large and emerging domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
the company s present or future competitors may be able to develop products and technologies comparable or superior to those offered by the company  and to adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies or evolving market needs 
the company believes that the competitive factors affecting the market for the company s products and technologies include product performance  price and quality  product functionality and features  the ease of integration  and implementation of the products and technologies with other hardware and software components in the oem s products 
in addition  the markets in which the company competes are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  declining average sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to compete effectively in its respective markets  that competition will not intensify or that future competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
importance of intellectual property the company s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
the company has filed several us and foreign patent applications and to date has a number of issued us and foreign patents covering various aspects of its technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other property rights 
the company is not currently a party to any claims of this nature 
there can be no assurances that third parties will not assert additional claims or initiate litigation against the company or its customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of the company s proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company or others 
management of growth  dependence on key personnel the growth of the company and its subsidiaries has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its administrative  operational and financial resources  and has increased  and will continue to increase  the level of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel 
the company anticipates that any future growth will require it to recruit and hire a number of new personnel in engineering  operations  finance  sales and marketing 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company can recruit and retain necessary personnel to operate its business and support future growth 
the company s ability to manage its growth successfully also will require the company to continue to expand and improve its administrative  operational  management and financial systems and controls 
volatility of stock price the trading price of the common stock has been  and will likely continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in the company s operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  strategic alliances between the company and third parties  general market fluctuations and other events and factors 
changes in earnings estimates made by brokerage firms and industry analysts relating to the markets in which the company does business  or relating to the company specifically  have in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
acquisitions from time to time  the company expects to make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that are complementary to its business strategy 
such future acquisitions would expose the company to risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses 
such risks include  among others  difficulty of assimilating the operations  information systems and personnel of the acquired business es  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  and the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through successful incorporation of the acquired technologies  employees and customers 
there can be no assurance that any potential acquisition will be consummated or  if consummated  that it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquired in process research and development uncertainties that could impede the progress of converting a development project to a developed technology include the availability of financial resources to complete the project  the technology not functioning properly  continued economic feasibility of developed technologies  customer acceptance  customer demand and customer qualification of such new technology and general competitive conditions in the industry 
there can be no assurance that the acquired r d projects associated with the acquisitions of valence and vip will be successfully completed and commercially introduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of its debt 
foreign currency the company has subsidiary operations in hong kong and the prc  and  accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses the local currency hong kong dollars as the functional currency for its subsidiaries 
translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars were not significant in fiscal  and due to the fact that the value of the hong kong dollar is currently pegged to the us dollar  and the exchange rate remained relatively constant throughout such fiscal years 
under the current circumstances  the company believes that the foreign currency market risk is not material 
the company actively monitors its foreign exchange exposure and  should circumstances change  intends to implement strategies to reduce its risk at such time that it determines that the benefits of such strategies outweigh the associated costs 
there can be no assurance that management s efforts to reduce foreign exchange exposure will be successful 
interest rates the company s line of credit bears interest based on the lending bank s prime rate or libor 
the interest rate on the balance of million outstanding at december  was 
if interest rates were to increase by  the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements would be additional interest expense of approximately
