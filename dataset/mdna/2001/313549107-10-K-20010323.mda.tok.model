included in the above restructuring charge were severance and exit costs of million  primarily related to the aftermarket and facility rationalizations 
during management expects to refine this program and may incur additional restructuring charges 
as such  the aggregate annualized ebit benefits of these actions have not been determined 
in  the company recognized million of restructuring charges related to severance and exit costs 
employee severance costs of million resulted from terminations in certain european operations of the company  employees at the company s milan  michigan plant  and certain executive severances 
the severance costs were based on the estimated amounts that will be paid to the affected employees pursuant to the company s workforce reduction policies and certain governmental regulations

these actions were substantially completed in in  the company paid million for employee severance costs and million for exit costs against the reserves 
also in  the company recognized million of reversals of restructuring charges recorded in previous years 
these reversals resulted primarily from lower than expected employee severance costs principally associated with the reduction of the aftermarket sales force and consolidation of certain operations in the americas 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  as a result of the t n  cooper automotive and fel pro acquisitions  the company recognized million of restructuring charges related to restructuring the company s operations in place prior to these acquisitions

in  the company sold its subsidiary  bertolotti pietro e figli  srl bertolotti  an italian aftermarket operation 
in  the company recognized a million charge primarily associated with their writedown of bertolotti s assets to their estimated fair value 
in  the company recognized an additional million loss associated with the writedown of bertolotti s assets to their fair value resulting from the sale 
offsetting the loss was a tax benefit of million resulting from the sale 
asbestos charge in  the company recorded a million charge consisting of approximately a million increase in the company s asbestos liability  which was partially offset by a million increase in the company s asbestos related insurance recoverable 
these charges and insurance recoveries were primarily based on an actuarial study the company commissioned during see litigation and environmental matters 
integration costs the company recognized million and million of integration costs in and  respectively  in connection with the acquisitions of t n  cooper automotive and fel pro 
these expenses included one time items such as brand integration  costs to pack and move productive inventory and fixed assets from one location to another and costs to change the identity of entities acquired 
there were no integration costs in interest expense interest expense increased million in to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the full year effect of the bond issue and higher amounts outstanding on the company s multi currency revolver during interest expense increased million in to million 
the increase is primarily attributable to the full year effect of the issuance of new debt to finance the acquisitions of cooper automotive and other businesses  offset slightly by debt reductions from cash flow generated from operations and the company s increased accounts receivable securitizations 
interest income interest income remained flat from to interest income decreased million in to million 
the decrease in interest income is due to the company using the proceeds of the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities for the purchase of t n and improved cash management 
management s discussion and analysis continued net gain on british pound forward contract in the fourth quarter of  in anticipation of the then pending t n acquisition  the company purchased a british pound currency option for million with a notional amount of billion 
the cost of the option and its change in fair value has been reflected in the results of operations in the fourth quarter of at december   the company had recognized a net loss of million on the transaction 
in january  the company settled the option and recognized an additional loss of million 
in january  in anticipation of the then pending t n acquisition  the company entered into a forward contract to purchase pounds billion for approximately billion 
as a result of favorable fluctuations in the british pound united states dollar exchange rate during the contract period  the company recognized a million gain 
the company entered into the above transaction to serve as an economic hedge for the purchase of t n 
however  this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting under us gaap  and therefore is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations caption net gain on british pound forward contract 
income taxes the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates differ from statutory rates due to changes in valuation allowances  rate variances and changes for certain state and foreign jurisdictions  and non deductible goodwill 
the company increased its valuation allowance by million for foreign tax credits and other deferred tax assets that it concluded will not be realized 
tax expense differs from current income taxes payable due to timing differences  which for the last three years were significantly affected by asbestos payments 
the company expects that future income tax expense will be greater than current income taxes payable primarily due to the effect of asbestos payments 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of  million  net of a valuation allowance of million  and deferred tax liabilities of  million 
the company evaluates the necessity for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by taxing jurisdiction 
in all countries except the us and the uk  the deferred tax liabilities are greater than the net deferred tax assets  and they generally reverse in similar periods 
in the us and uk  the company has deferred tax assets of  million  net of related valuation allowances of million and deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets in the uk and us relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards of million  asbestos liabilities of million and accruals for employee benefits of million 
the net operating losses in the uk have no expiration date  and the net operating losses in the us expire in various amounts through in addition  the deferred taxes related to employee benefits and asbestos become deductible as paid over the next and years  respectively 
realization of the deferred tax assets in the us and uk are dependent in part upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities but also on future taxable income 
future taxable income is dependent upon a number of factors including  but not limited to  sufficient levels of earnings before income taxes and the amount and timing of asbestos payments 
based on consideration of historical and future earnings before income taxes  the company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  beyond those specifically reserved  will be realized 
the company will evaluate its deferred taxes and related valuation allowances quarterly 
if at any time the company believes that current or future taxable income will not support the basis for recognizing the benefit of the deferred tax assets  valuation allowances will be provided accordingly 
extraordinary items as a result of certain financing transactions see liquidity and capital resources  the company incurred extraordinary losses on the early retirement of debt of million and million  net of related tax benefits of million and million  in and  respectively 
management s discussion and analysis continued cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting the costs of start up activities 
sop was effective january  and requires that start up costs capitalized prior to january  be written off and any future start up costs be expensed as incurred 
the company adopted sop on january  and subsequently wrote off  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  the unamortized balance of start up costs totaling million  net of applicable income tax benefits of million  in the quarter ended march  effect of accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in june sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends and clarifies certain guidance in sfas no 
the company has implemented the appropriate systems and processes to adopt these statements effective january  changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions  the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
for cashflow hedge transactions  the fair value of the derivative instrument will be reported in other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current period earnings 
the statements provide for the recognition of a cumulative adjustment for an accounting change  as of the date of adoption 
the company estimates that it will record a net of tax cumulative effect type loss of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all derivative instruments that will be designated as cashflow hedges 
the adjustment to current earnings for fair value hedges is not material 
the adoption of this standard will also impact assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
this statement provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
this statement is effective for accounts receivable securitization programs entered into after march the company s current accounts receivable securitization program expires june and is not required to comply with the new accounting provisions of sfas no 
the expanded disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are provided in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the implementation of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or its results of operations and is not expected to have a significant impact on an ongoing basis 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives 
the eitf addresses the recognition  measurement and income statement classification for sales incentives offered voluntarily by a vendor without charge to customers that can be used in  or are exercisable by customers as a result of a single transaction 
eitf no 
is required to be applied beginning april  the effect of the adoption has not been finalized  however the company believes that the adoption will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis continued liquidity and capital resources cash flow used by operating activities cash flow used by operating activities was million in among the factors impacting operating cash flows were payments related to asbestos of million and restructuring and rationalization reserves of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  and a decrease in other current liabilities and assets of million 
these usages were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
cash flow used by investing activities cash flow used by investing activities was million in the company made capital expenditures of million to implement process improvements  increase manufacturing capacity  information technology and new product introductions 
these cash flows were offset by proceeds of million from the divestiture of several businesses 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions and investments in affiliates  will be approximately million 
the company expects that funding for these expenditures will be from operations and external sources as required 
cash flow provided from financing activities cash flow provided from financing activities was million in  primarily arising from proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt  offset by principal payments on long term debt of million and a repurchase of accounts receivable under securitization of million 
in june  the company entered into a new million accounts receivable securitization agreement replacing the existing million agreement 
the facility s maturity date is june  in december  the company modified certain provisions of the existing facility  however  the amount and maturity remained the same 
in december  the company executed its fourth amended and restated credit agreement  senior credit agreements 
the senior credit agreements provide for an additional term loan of million and a senior secured revolving credit facility of million 
in addition to the pledge of capital stock described below  the company provided collateral in the form of a pledge of its domestic inventories  domestic accounts receivable not otherwise sold under securitizations  domestic plant  equipment and real property  and its domestic intellectual property 
this increased the company s borrowing limits under the senior credit agreements to billion 
the company had billion outstanding under these senior credit agreements as of december   which are due from to with an average interest rate of 
in january  the company borrowed million on its new term loan 
in march  the company amended its senior credit agreement to modify certain covenants 
the company has pledged of the capital stock of certain united states subsidiaries  of capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain intercompany loans to secure the senior credit agreements of the company 
certain of such pledges also extend to the notes  medium term notes and senior notes 
in addition  certain subsidiaries of the company have guaranteed the senior debt refer to note  consolidating condensed financial information of guarantor subsidiaries 
the agreement relating to the facilities described above contains restrictive covenants 
the more significant of these covenants are requirements for the maintenance of consolidated net worth  a consolidated leverage ratio  cash flow coverage  limitations on the early retirement of debt  additional borrowings  and payment of common management s discussion and analysis continued dividends 
the agreement includes a provision which would result in all of the unpaid principal and accrued interest of the facilities becoming due immediately upon a change of control in ownership of the company 
during  the company experienced a decline in the public credit ratings of its bonds 
as a result of the decline in its credit ratings  the company expects to incur substantially higher costs of financing for the foreseeable future as compared to prior years should it attempt any capital market activity 
the company s ability to obtain cash adequate to fund its needs depends generally on the results of its operations  restructuring initiatives  amounts and timing of asbestos payments and the availability of financing 
management believes that cash flow from operations  in conjunction with borrowings from its existing credit agreements  will be sufficient to meet current debt service requirements  fund capital expenditures in the future and meet its asbestos obligations 
in the long term  the company believes that the benefits from the recently announced restructuring and sgi programs and changes to its asbestos strategy along with financing available under its senior credit agreements and any future credit agreements will provide adequate long term cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance in this regard or that the terms available for any future financing  if required  would be favorable to the company 
also certain obligations  particularly asbestos obligations  can be impacted by factors outside the company s control 
a significant increase in such obligations or asbestos claims  could impair the company s liquidity 
asbestos liability and legal proceedings t n asbestos litigation in the united states  the company s united kingdom subsidiary  t n ltd  and two united states subsidiaries the t n companies are among many defendants named in numerous court actions alleging personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products 
t n ltd 
is also subject to asbestos disease litigation  to a lesser extent  in the united kingdom and france 
because of the slow onset of asbestos related diseases  management anticipates that similar claims will be made in the future 
it is not known how many claims may be made nor the expenditures which may ultimately arise therefrom 
in addition  there are a number of factors that could impact the settlement costs into the future  including but not limited to changes in the legal environment  possible insolvency of co defendants  and establishment of an acceptable administrative non litigation claims resolution mechanism 
in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its estimate of asbestos related liability for the t n companies by million and recorded a related insurance recoverable asset of million 
the revision in the estimate of probable asbestos related liability principally resulted from a study performed by an econometric firm that specializes in these types of matters 
the revised liability approximately billion represents the company s estimate for claims currently pending and those which can be reasonably estimated to be asserted in a future period 
the company believes that these claims will be paid over the next years 
in arriving at the revised liability for the t n companies  assumptions have been made regarding the total number of claims anticipated to be received in the future period  the typical cost of settlement which is sensitive to the industry in which the plaintiff claims exposure  the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is being brought  the rate of receipt of claims  the settlement strategy in dealing with outstanding claims and the timing of settlements 
while management believes that the liability and receivable recorded are appropriate for anticipated losses arising from asbestos related claims against the t n companies for the period covered  given the nature and complexity of the factors affecting the estimated liability and potential insurance recovery the actual liability and insurance recovery may differ 
no assurance can be given that the t n companies will not be subject to material additional liabilities and significant additional litigation relating to asbestos for the period covered 
in management s discussion and analysis continued the event that such liabilities exceed the amounts recorded by the company or the remaining insurance coverage  the company s results of operations  business  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the ultimate liability for all pending and future claims is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of forecasting the numerous variables that can affect the liability 
the company does not believe it can reasonably determine the ultimate liability as the level of uncertainty is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims  the nature of such claims and the cost to resolve them 
as additional experience is gained regarding claims or other new information becomes available regarding the potential liability  the company will reassess its potential liability and revise the estimates as appropriate 
accordingly it is reasonably possible that the ultimate losses from asbestos related claims will be greater than amounts recorded 
t n ltd 
is a defendant in approximately  pending personal injury claims as of december  during  approximately  new claims naming t n ltd 
were received 
the two united states subsidiaries are defendants in approximately  pending personal injury claims as of december  during  approximately  new claims naming the two united states subsidiaries were received 
a number of years ago  t n ltd 
appointed the center for claims resolution ccr as exclusive representative in relation to all asbestos related personal injury claims made against the t n companies in the united states 
the ccr has provided to its member companies a litigation defense  claims handling and administration service in respect to united states asbestos related disease claims 
pursuant to the ccr producer agreement  t n ltd 
was entitled to appoint a representative as one of the five voting directors on the ccr s board of directors 
also pursuant to that agreement  members of the ccr contributed towards indemnity payments in each claim in which the member is named 
contributions to such indemnity payments were calculated on a case by case basis according to sharing agreements among the ccr s members 
effective january   the two united states subsidiaries appointed a law firm specializing in asbestos matters as their litigation defense  claims handling and administrative service provider 
indemnity and defense obligations incurred while members of the ccr are continuing to be honored 
this change was intended to create greater economic and defense efficiencies for the two companies 
the t n companies have entered into million of surety to meet ccr collateral requirements for past obligations 
the surety has a declining balance and is effective through february  the membership of the ccr has decreased in the past year for both voluntary and involuntary reasons 
one instance involved the termination of a member by the ccr board 
that former member had refused to provide required surety for agreed to settlements made while a member 
the ccr has tried to recover the funds owed  however  the former member has since filed for bankruptcy and recovery is therefore uncertain 
another member has terminated its participation due to its determination that  as a trust  it lacked sufficient assets to commit to any new settlements 
this member has also asserted that it is entitled to certain reimbursements which the ccr does not believe to be appropriate 
additionally  a third member had filed for bankruptcy in december any additional cost to the remaining ccr members  net of the security provided  is uncertain 
the company however has provided for its best estimate of the impact of these events 
the t n companies could experience an increase in liability if there are any future negative developments in these areas 
certain codefendant companies both members and nonmembers of the ccr have recently filed for reorganization under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
as a consequence  litigation against them with some exceptions has been stayed or restricted 
due to the uncertainties involved  the long term effect of these proceedings on the company s current and future exposure cannot be determined 
in february  the ccr and its members significantly amended its indemnity naming and services agreement 
the ccr indemnity naming formula has been replaced with a provision that  for all claims settled on or after february   ccr members would be directly responsible for payment of their own indemnity management s discussion and analysis continued obligations 
the amendments will allow ccr members to choose the services they wish to continue receiving from the ccr 
t n ltd 
plans to continue with the ccr for claims handling and administrative services 
however  t n ltd 
has appointed an outside law firm specializing in asbestos matters to handle its litigation defense 
in  t n ltd 
purchased for the t n companies a pounds million layer of insurance which will be triggered should the aggregate costs of claims filed after june   where the exposure occurred prior to that date  exceed pounds million 
the company now believes that the aggregate cost of claims filed after june  will exceed the trigger point 
the company believes based on its review of the insurance policy and its advice from outside counsel  that it is probable that the t n companies will be entitled to receive payment from the reinsurers for the cost of claims in excess of the trigger point of the insurance 
based on this assessment  the company recorded an insurance recoverable asset under the t n policy of million in the fourth quarter of the company has reviewed the financial viability and legal obligations of the three reinsurance companies involved and has concluded that there is little risk of the reinsurers not being able to meet their obligation to pay  once the claims filed after june  exceed the pounds million trigger point 
the company does not expect to reach the trigger point of the insurance or begin to collect on this insurance recoverable for the next several years 
the us claims costs applied against this policy are converted at a fixed exchange rate of pounds 
as such  if the market exchange rate is less then pounds  the company will effectively have a discount from recovery on claims made with the insurance companies 
at december   the million insurance recoverable asset is net of an exchange rate discount of million 
the ultimate exposure of the t n companies with respect to claims will depend upon the extent to which the insurance described above will be available to cover such claims  the amount paid for indemnity and defense  changes in the legal environment and other factors 
abex and wagner asbestos litigation former businesses of cooper automotive  primarily abex and wagner  are involved as defendants in numerous court actions in the united states alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products  mainly involving friction products 
abex is a defendant in approximately  pending claims as of december  during  approximately  new claims naming this defendant were received 
wagner is a defendant in approximately  claims as of december  during  approximately  new claims naming this defendant were received 
in  the company acquired the capital stock of a former cooper automotive entity resulting in the assumption by a company subsidiary of contractual liability  under certain circumstances  for all claims pending and to be filed in the future alleging exposure to certain wagner automotive and industrial friction products and for all claims filed after august   alleging exposure to certain abex non railroad and non aircraft friction products 
in the fourth quarter of  the company decreased its estimate of probable asbestos related liability by million  which was accompanied by an approximately equivalent reduction in the insurance recoverable asset 
the revised estimate of probable asbestos related liability principally resulted from a study performed by an econometric firm that specializes in these types of matters 
the revised liability approximately million represents the company s estimate for claims currently pending and those which can be reasonably estimated to be asserted in a future period 
the company believes that these claims will be paid over the next years 
in arriving at the revised liability for abex and wagner  assumptions have been made regarding the number of claims anticipated to be received in the future period  the typical cost of settlement which is sensitive to the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is being brought  the rate of receipt of claims  and the timing of settlements 
while management believes that the liability and receivable recorded for these claims are appropriate for anticipated losses arising from asbestos related claims against abex and wagner for the covered period  given the nature and complexity of factors affecting the estimated liability and potential insurance recovery the actual management s discussion and analysis continued liability and insurance recovery may differ 
no assurance can be given that abex and wagner will not be subject to material additional liabilities and significant additional litigation relating to asbestos for the period covered 
in the event that such liabilities exceed the amounts recorded by the company or the remaining insurance coverage  the company s results of operations  business  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the ultimate liability for all pending and future claims is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of forecasting the numerous variables that can affect the liability 
the company does not believe it can reasonably determine the ultimate liability as the level of uncertainty is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims  the nature of such claims  and the cost to resolve them 
as additional experience is gained regarding claims or other new information becomes available regarding the potential liability  the company will reassess its potential liability and revise the estimates as appropriate 
accordingly it is reasonably possible that the ultimate losses from asbestos related claims will be greater than amounts recorded 
abex maintained product liability insurance coverage for most of the time that it manufactured products that contained asbestos 
the subsidiary of the company that may be liable for the post august asbestos claims against abex has the benefit of that insurance 
abex has been in litigation since with the insurance carriers of its primary layer of liability concerning coverage for asbestos claims 
abex also has substantial excess layer liability insurance coverage that  barring unforeseen insolvencies of excess carriers or other adverse events  should provide coverage for asbestos claims against abex 
the company believes that based on its review of the insurance policies  the viability of the insurance carriers  and advice from outside legal counsel  it is probable that abex will receive payments for a substantial majority of the cost of claims 
wagner also maintained product liability insurance coverage for some of the time that it manufactured products that contained asbestos 
the subsidiary of the company that may be liable for asbestos claims against wagner has the benefit of that insurance 
primary layer liability insurance coverage for asbestos claims against wagner is the subject of an agreement with wagner s solvent primary carriers 
the agreement provides for partial reimbursement of indemnity and defense costs for wagner asbestos claims until exhaustion of aggregate limits 
wagner also has substantial excess layer liability insurance coverage which  barring unforeseen insolvencies of excess carriers or other adverse events  should provide coverage for asbestos claims against wagner 
the company believes that based on its review of the insurance policies  the financial viability of the insurance carriers  and advice from outside legal counsel  it is probable that wagner will receive payment for a portion of the cost of claims 
based on the probable conclusion of collection under the insurance policies  the company has recorded a million insurance recoverable asset related to the abex and wagner liability 
federal mogul and fel pro asbestos litigation the company also is sued in its own name as one of a large number of defendants in a number of lawsuits brought by claimants alleging injury due to exposure to asbestos 
the company s fel pro subsidiary has also been named as a defendant in a number of product liability cases involving asbestos  primarily involving gasket or packing products 
fel pro is a defendant in approximately  pending claims as of december  during  approximately  new claims were filed 
over  of these claims have been transferred to a federal court where they reside subject to removal back into the tort system only if certain medical and product identification conditions are met 
the company is defending all such claims vigorously and believes that it and fel pro have substantial defenses to liability and insurance coverage for defense and indemnity 
while the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that asbestos claims pending against the company and fel pro as of december   will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
management s discussion and analysis continued aggregate of asbestos liability and insurance recoverable asset the following is a summary of the asbestos liability and the insurance recoverable asset for in millions of dollars t n abex companies wagner other total liability balance at december    provision adjustments payments other balance at december    asset balance at december  provision adjustments proceeds other balance at december  as of december   the company has provided an aggregated liability for all of its subsidiaries and businesses with potential asbestos liability of approximately billion for claims currently pending and those which can be reasonably expected to be asserted in a future period 
the company believes that these claims will be paid over the next years 
of this amount  the company expects to incur asbestos payments of approximately million over the next months and has reflected this as a current liability 
this estimate is based in part on recent and historical claims experience  medical information  the impact of changes in indemnity sharing within the ccr and the current legal environment 
the company cannot reasonably estimate a liability beyond the period encompassed in its estimates as the level of uncertainty is too great to provide for reasonable estimation of the number of future claims  the nature of such claims  or the cost to resolve them 
the company believes that it is probable that its subsidiaries with asbestos related liabilities and related insurance policies  the t n companies  abex  wagner and fel pro will collect the recorded aggregated insurance recoverable asset of million 
environmental matters the company is a defendant in lawsuits filed  or the recipient of administrative orders issued  in various jurisdictions pursuant to the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of cercla or other similar federal or state environmental laws 
these laws require responsible parties to pay for cleaning up contamination resulting from hazardous wastes which were discharged into the environment by them or by others to which they sent such wastes for disposition 
in addition  the company has been notified by the united states environmental protection agency and various state agencies that it may be a potentially responsible party prp under such law for the cost of cleaning up certain other hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities pursuant to cercla and other federal and state environmental laws 
prp designation requires the funding of site investigations and subsequent remedial activities 
at most of the sites that are likely to be costliest to clean up  which are often current or former commercial waste disposal facilities to which numerous companies sent waste  the company s exposure is expected to be limited 
despite the joint and several liability which might be imposed on the company under cercla and some of the other laws pertaining to these sites  management s discussion and analysis continued the company s share of the total waste has generally been small 
the other companies which also sent wastes  often numbering in the hundreds or more  generally include large  solvent publicly owned companies  and in most such situations the government agencies and courts have imposed liability in some reasonable relationship to contribution of waste 
in addition  the company has identified certain present and former properties at which it may be responsible for cleaning up environmental contamination 
the company is actively seeking to resolve these matters 
although difficult to quantify based on the complexity of the issues  the company has accrued the estimated cost associated with such matters based upon current available information from site investigations and consultants 
the environmental reserve was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributable to remediation payments made during management believes that such accruals will be adequate to cover the company s estimated liability for its exposure in respect to such matters 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and raw material prices 
to manage a portion of these inherent risks  the company purchases various derivative financial instruments and commodity futures contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk the company is subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to its operations in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures and sells its products in north america  south america  asia  europe and africa 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of the company s international businesses into united states dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates are generally reported as a component of stockholders equity for the company s foreign subsidiaries reporting in local currencies and as a component of income for its foreign subsidiaries using the us dollar as the functional currency 
the company s equity was reduced by million and million during and  respectively  primarily due to cumulative translation adjustments resulting from the strong us dollar 
as of december  and  the company s net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company manages certain aspects of its foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts 
the company generally tries to utilize natural hedges within its foreign currency activities  including the matching of revenues and costs 
the unrealized gains and losses on the company s foreign currency transactions were immaterial at december  and all currency forward option contracts will expire within the next twelve months 
management s discussion and analysis continued interest rate risk the company s variable interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
most of the company s interest expense is fixed through long term borrowings to mitigate the impact of such potential exposure 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based upon spot rate observations as of the reporting date 
interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december  millions of dollars fair value at december  thereafter total liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate   average interest rate variable rate   average interest rate interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december  millions of dollars fair value at december  thereafter total liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate average interest rate commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials in the production process and has entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum alloy  high grade aluminum  lead and nickel 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge against the changes in certain specific commodity prices of the purchase commitments outstanding 
as of december   the net unrealized losses for commodity contracts were immaterial
