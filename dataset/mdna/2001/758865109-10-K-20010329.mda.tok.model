item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction general our company was formed in november to acquire  own and operate clusters of radio stations in small and mid sized markets 
since that time  we have consummated a number of mergers  acquisitions  borrowings and issuances of additional equity  including the successful completion of an initial public offering ipo of  shares of common stock in january concurrently with the ipo  we entered into a new revolving credit facility  and terminated our old revolving credit facility 
the ipo and new credit facility have strengthened our balance sheet and allowed us to triple our asset base in year through the acquisition of radio stations in six markets and the disposal of radio stations in three markets 
as a result of these transactions  we now own and operate a total of radio stations in markets and have entered into three new markets that rank among the top markets in the country albany  new york  grand rapids  michigan  and el paso  texas 
we also began providing programming and other services to three additional stations in st 
cloud  minnesota that we have agreed to acquire 
the principal source of our revenue is the sale of broadcasting time on our radio stations for advertising 
as a result  our revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations charge 
correspondingly  the rates are based upon a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic arbitron radio market reports 
in  our radio stations derived approximately of their net broadcast revenues from local and regional advertising in the markets in which they operated  and the remainder resulted principally from the sale of national advertising 
the financial results of our business are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our first calendar quarter will be expected to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter will be expected to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
excluding gains on the sale or exchange of radio stations  we have historically generated net losses primarily as a result of significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization relating to the acquisition of radio stations and interest charges on outstanding debt 
we have historically amortized the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to substantially all of our radio station acquisitions made prior to over a to year period 
based upon the large number of acquisitions we consummated within the last two years  we anticipate that depreciation and amortization charges will continue to be significant for several years 
to the extent that we complete additional acquisitions  our interest expense and depreciation and amortization charges are likely to increase 
we are amortizing the fcc licenses and goodwill attributable to our acquisitions in and beyond over a useful life not to exceed years 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  the ability to provide popular programming  local market and regional competition  relative efficiency of radio broadcasting compared to other advertising media  signal strength and government regulation and policies 
from time to time the markets in which we operate experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect our revenue 
we believe  however  that this impact is somewhat mitigated by our diverse geographical presence 

table of contents the performance of a radio station group  such as ours  is customarily measured by its ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
the term broadcast cash flow means operating income loss before depreciation and amortization and corporate general and administrative expenses  excluding barter activity 
although broadcast cash flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we believe that broadcast cash flow is accepted by the broadcasting industry as a generally recognized measure of performance and is used by analysts who report publicly on the performance of broadcasting companies 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which is effective for the fourth quarter of in sab  the sec staff expressed its views regarding the appropriate recognition of revenue with regard to a variety of circumstances 
we have evaluated sab and have determined that the impact of adoption is not material 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions including stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin provides guidance for certain issues that arose in applying apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have adopted fin  as required in the third quarter of  and deemed that the impact of adoption is not material 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas prescribes the accounting treatment for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
as of december   we have not employed any financial instruments to manage our interest rate exposure 
we may employ financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue such financial instruments for trading purposes 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  an amendment to sfas we have adopted sfas and related amendments  as required in the year  and have determined the impact of adoption to be immaterial 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this form k includes certain forward looking statements with respect to our company and its business that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are influenced by our financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and the plans and objectives of management for future operations 
they use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  project and other similar expressions 
although we believe our expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  we cannot assure you that our expectations will prove correct 
actual results and developments may differ materially from those conveyed in the forward looking statements 
for these statements  we claim the protections for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 
table of contents results of operations following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes 
compared to in compared to  we experienced substantial increases in net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses  and interest expense  due primarily to our year acquisitions of radio stations in el paso  texas  utica rome  watertown and albany  new york  grand rapids  michigan  and chico  california  as well as a time brokerage arrangement in st 
cloud  minnesota 
accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period  nor are they necessarily indicative of results in the future 
net revenues  station operating expenses  and broadcast cash flow net broadcast revenues  operating expenses and broadcast cash flow in increased  and  respectively  over that of the period 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we have been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of any markets under contract for disposition 
these comparable results between and are listed in the table below by quarter 
net revenue broadcast cash flow dollars in thousands first quarter first quarter change second quarter second quarter change third quarter third quarter change fourth quarter fourth quarter change note each quarter represents the markets and stations that we owned or operated for five full quarters at that time 
corporate expenses corporate general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  reflecting the increased infrastructure required to support a public company whose stock is listed on a national exchange 
corporate personnel increased by approximately from to and additionally  we moved into new corporate facilities in the third quarter of to accommodate the new infrastructure 
depreciation and amortization due to purchase price allocations of million of property and equipment in addition to million of intangible assets from acquisitions in  depreciation and amortization expense 
table of contents increased by approximately compared to from million in to million in additionally  for properties acquired in  we are amortizing intangibles over years rather than years for properties acquired in and prior years 
interest expense interest expense decreased by approximately in compared to as average debt levels in were approximately million  compared to average debt levels of million in average debt levels were lower in as we had paid down all our debt with proceeds from the ipo in january and subsequently did not incur any borrowings until august when we borrowed million under our new credit facility 
the interest expense savings on the lower debt levels in were partially offset by increased commitment fees on the unborrowed capacity of our new credit facility 
gain on the sale of radio stations on august   we completed an exchange agreement entered into with clear channel broadcasting  inc  capstar radio operating company and their affiliates in which we exchanged our eight stations serving the mansfield  ohio fm am and victorville  california fm am markets plus approximately million in cash for ten stations serving the grand rapids  michigan fm am and albany  new york fm am markets 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized a gain on the exchange of approximately million which is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  income tax expense we have cumulative federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  these loss carryforwards will expire in years through the utilization of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section in and  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets following an assessment of the realizability of such amounts 
in  we recognized a gain of approximately million on the asset exchange from the clear channel transaction 
for tax purposes this transaction was treated as a like kind exchange resulting in a deferred tax liability pursuant to the provisions of internal revenue code section  of approximately million 
in arriving at the determination as to the amount of the valuation allowance required for the current year  we considered the impact of deferred tax liabilities resulting from purchase transactions  statutory restrictions on the use of operating losses and a tax planning strategy available to us 
consequently  we determined that no valuation allowance is required for and released the full valuation allowance 
as a result of these events  no income tax expense was recorded in on a quarterly basis  we will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
extraordinary loss on january   we paid off the outstanding debt from our old credit facility  accrued interest and related fees totaling approximately million using proceeds from our ipo 
this final paydown resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately million  net of income tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs 
compared to on june   we completed a merger with faircom inc in which faircom merged into one of our subsidiaries 
even though our subsidiary was the surviving entity in the merger  faircom 
table of contents was deemed to be the accounting acquirer  and the historical financial statements of faircom became our historical financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations and those of the other entities that merged with or were acquired by us as part of the transactions completed june  have been included in our consolidated financial statements only from june  because of our june acquisitions see note and  to a lesser extent  our acquisitions of stations in st 
cloud  minnesota and erie  pennsylvania in  we experienced substantial increases in net broadcast revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization  corporate general and administrative expenses  and interest expense in compared to accordingly  the results of our operations in are not comparable to those of the prior period 
for compared to  net broadcast revenues increased from million to million  station operating expenses increased from million to million  and depreciation and amortization increased from million to million 
we experienced a increase from million to million in corporate general and administrative expenses in compared to this increase was comparatively less than the increase in net broadcasting revenues and station operating expenses because these expenses in included  in additional compensation expense resulting from our issuance of stock options in the faircom merger to two officers of faircom  as provided in the merger agreement 
interest expense increased from million to million as a result of increased borrowings used to finance the various acquisitions and a million charge to interest expense due to an increase in our warrant liability  along with a  charge related to the write off of deferred financing fees in connection with the modification of our former bank credit facility 
additionally  in as a result of the old credit facility paydown in accordance with the original terms of the credit facility  we recognized an extraordinary loss of  net of income tax  from the write off of related deferred financing costs 
the effective tax rate applied to the extraordinary loss was zero due to the company s cumulative loss carryforward position 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter comparisons can be made for results of operations for those markets in which we had been operating for five full quarters  exclusive of any markets held for sale 
this group of comparable markets in  is represented by six markets and stations 
in these comparable markets  for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in  our net broadcast revenues  excluding barter revenues  increased and broadcast cash flow increased by 
these comparative results were adversely affected by circumstances in our flint  michigan market 
the competitive environment in flint changed in late with the addition of a new commercial fm radio station 
the flint school system previously owned this station and operated it as a non commercial facility 
the school board sold the station at auction to an experienced commercial broadcaster 
in  and shortly before we took control of faircom s cluster of three stations in the flint market  the new commercial station changed format and in months became the top station in the marketplace in terms of adult listenership 
its success impacted advertising market rates and the distribution of advertising dollars to stations in the market  adversely affecting our market share of revenues  along with that of other competitors 
it was estimated by an industry source that in  its first full year of commercial operation  the new station would capture approximately of the market revenue 
in january  we made significant changes in the management structure and personnel at our flint stations  which had been delayed due to certain contractual arrangements 
the acclimation of the new management team and related operational changes took most of to have effect 
for these reasons  we do not believe the results of our flint stations were comparable to those of the prior year until the end of the first quarter of 
table of contents for the stations in our other five comparable markets  net broadcast revenues  excluding barter revenues  increased and broadcast cash flow increased for the six months ended december  as compared to the same period in liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december  was approximately  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million cash used in operating activities in the increase was due primarily to the operating activities of radio stations acquired in cash flow used in investing activities increased to million in compared to million used in  due to the increase in the acquisition of radio stations in cash flows provided by financing activities increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to net proceeds received from our ipo in january sources of funds in  our sources of cash totaled approximately million and were derived from a combination of the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  borrowings from our new credit facility  cash provided from operating activities  and proceeds from the sale of our stations in flagstaff  arizona 
on january   we terminated our old credit facility and entered into a new credit facility  which is a million senior secured seven year reducing revolving facility  that also provides for an additional million on substantially the same terms  to fund future acquisitions  subject to terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
this additional million borrowing capability is available during the first months of the facility and thereafter will convert to a term loan maturing december  this credit facility permits the borrowing of available credit for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes  including transaction fees and expenses  and to fund pending and permitted future acquisitions 
the credit facility also permits us to request from time to time that the lenders issue letters of credit in an amount up to million in accordance with the same lending provisions 
the commitment  and our maximum borrowings  will reduce over five years beginning in as follows in thousands december  commitment amount the million letter of credit sub limit also reduces proportionately but not below million 
mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions will also be required from certain asset sales  subordinated debt proceeds  excess cash flow amounts and sales of equity securities 
under the new credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum interest rate coverage ratio  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum corporate overhead  and maximum financial leverage ratio and to observe negative covenants customary for facilities of this type 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option  either a the higher of the rate announced or published publicly from time to time by the agent as its corporate base of interest or the overnight federal funds rate plus  in either case plus the applicable margin 
table of contents determined under the credit facility  or b the reserve adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin which varies between and depending upon our financial leverage 
borrowings under the new credit facility bore interest at the rate of as of december  we are required to pay certain fees to the agent and the lenders for the underwriting commitment  administration and use of the credit facility 
our indebtedness under the credit facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of our operating and license subsidiaries stock and is guaranteed by these subsidiaries 
as of march   we had borrowings under this facility of million 
on january   we closed our ipo of  shares of our common stock 
on february   the underwriters exercised their over allotment of an additional  shares 
all shares were sold at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of approximately million see note 
on september   we completed the sale of our flagstaff  arizona radio stations to yavapai broadcasting corporation for approximately million 
these proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings on the new credit facility 
uses of funds in  we utilized our sources of cash primarily to acquire radio stations totaling million  pay off our credit facility debt and related costs in the amount of million  and fund other financing activities totaling million 
the net proceeds from the ipo in january were used as follows approximately million was used to repay all borrowings  accrued interest and related fees under our old credit facility along with the fees associated with entering into the new bank credit facility  million was used to fund our acquisitions of radio stations in utica rome and watertown  new york and el paso  texas  million was used to redeem our series b convertible preferred stock and pay accrued dividends  million was used to pay accrued dividends on all other series of convertible preferred stock  which were converted to common stock on a one for one basis  million was used to repurchase  shares of common stock from an affiliate of one of the underwriters in order to comply with the rules of the national association of securities dealers  inc  and the remaining net proceeds of approximately million were used to fund a portion of the cash required for the clear channel transaction 
on august   we completed the clear channel transaction  in which we exchanged our eight stations serving the mansfield  ohio fm am and victorville  california fm am markets plus approximately million in cash for ten stations serving the grand rapids  michigan fm am and albany  new york fm am markets 
we borrowed million on the new credit facility and used residual cash from the ipo and cash from operations to fund this transaction 
in june of  we initiated a program to buy back shares of our common stock at certain market price levels 
we acquired a total of  shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in in  we funded capital expenditures of million to upgrade our equipment and facilities  primarily at stations recently acquired in order to remain competitive and to create cost savings over the long term 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in due to the radio stations we acquired in and the correlating increase in the size of our infrastructure 

table of contents pending sources and uses of funds on june   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire by merger with starcom  inc two fm and one am radio stations kkrs fm  klzz fm and kxss am serving the st 
cloud  minnesota market for approximately million in cash 
we made an escrow deposit in the amount of  the federal communications commission has approved the assignment of the station licenses  and we anticipate closing this acquisition in march or april the closing of this transaction had been delayed by the fcc s analysis of market revenue share in st 
cloud  minnesota 
on july   pending closing of the purchase  we began providing programming and other services to the stations under a time brokerage agreement 
on december  we entered into a definitive agreement with nextmedia group ii  inc and its affiliate to acquire substantially all of the assets of wjet fm serving the erie  pennsylvania market for approximately million in cash 
we delivered an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of  to secure our obligations under the agreement 
an application seeking fcc approval of the assignment of the station licenses was filed on january  the closing of this transaction has been delayed by the fcc s analysis of market revenue share in erie  pennsylvania 
on november   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all the assets of our three southern california radio stations ktpi fm and kavc am licensed to mojave and tehachapi  and koss fm licensed to rosamond to concord media group  inc for approximately million 
an application seeking fcc approval of the assignment of the station licenses was filed on november  action on the fcc application for approval of this sale has been delayed due to the filing of an objection by the owner of a competing station in the market based on the alleged ownership concentration claimed to be allocable to the proposed buyer following the sale 
we intend to apply the net proceeds of this sale to pay down our credit facility 
we believe the cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our new credit facility will be sufficient to complete our pending acquisitions and to meet our requirements for corporate expenses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  based on our projected operations and indebtedness 
after giving effect to all pending transactions  the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility would be approximately million with available borrowings of approximately million  subject to the terms and conditions of the credit facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as borrowings under our new credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates 
it is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
as of december   we have not employed any financial instruments to manage our interest rate exposure 
based on our exposure to variable rate borrowings at december   a one percent change in the weighted average interest rate would change the company s annual interest expense by  to satisfy the requirements imposed under the terms of our old credit facility  we had previously entered into a two year collar agreement effective august  for a notional amount of million to mitigate the risk of interest rates increasing under this facility 
on february  we terminated the collar agreement in conjunction with the termination of the old credit facility 
in the event that we deem it economically feasible  at some time in the future we would consider entering into an agreement to mitigate interest rate risk
