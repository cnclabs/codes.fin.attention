the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview neose develops proprietary technologies for the synthesis and manufacture of complex carbohydrates  which are chains of simple sugar molecules that can be joined together in many different combinations 
our enzymatic glycosylation technology platform makes feasible the synthesis of a wide range of complex carbohydrates for pharmaceutical  biotechnology  nutritional  and consumer product applications 
our glycoadvance program uses our technologies to enable the completion and correction of glycosylation in recombinant glycoprotein discovery  development  and manufacture 
our glycotherapeutics program uses our technologies to develop and produce novel carbohydrate based therapeutics  and our glycoactives program uses our technologies to develop and produce novel carbohydrate based food ingredients 
we have incurred operating losses each year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect additional losses for some time as we expand research and development efforts  expand manufacturing scale up activities  and begin sales and marketing activities 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements increased to approximately million in from approximately million in payments under our agreement with bristol myers accounted for approximately million of our collaborative revenues in we do not expect any future payments under this agreement unless bristol myers advises us to resume our activities 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional services rendered under our current research and development agreement with bristol myers  and non cash compensation expense associated with stock options granted to non employees 
during the year ended december   our joint venture with mcneil specialty reimbursed neose approximately million for the cost of research and development services and supplies provided to the joint venture 
this amount has been reflected as a reduction of research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional business development and administrative personnel  and the non cash compensation expense associated with stock options granted to non employees 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash and marketable securities balances during resulting from our public offering of million shares of common stock in march interest expense increased to  in from  in due to higher average interest rates  and was partly offset by lower average loan balances outstanding during years ended december  and revenues from collaborative agreements increased to  in from  in substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreements with bristol myers and wyeth ayerst 
substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreement with bristol myers 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased funding of outside research  and the amortization of acquired technology from cytel corporation 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased patent and general legal expenses associated with the intellectual property acquired from cytel corporation  and increased business development expense 
interest income increased to million in from million in due to higher average cash and marketable securities balances during interest expense decreased to  in from  in due to lower average loan balances outstanding during liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of our securities  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we had million in cash and marketable securities as of december   compared to million in cash and marketable securities as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to the proceeds from our public offering of million shares of common stock in march during   and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million of property  equipment  and building improvements 
we anticipate making capital expenditures during of at least million to provide additional cgmp manufacturing capacity in our horsham  pennsylvania facility to support the initial requirements of our anticipated glycoadvance customers 
even if we make these capital expenditures  we may not be able to enter into collaborations with potential glycoadvance customers 
in addition  we anticipate in the next to months we will obtain  either through lease or purchase  another facility of at least  square feet 
we plan to relocate all non cgmp research laboratories and corporate office space from our current facility in horsham  pennsylvania into the new facility  leaving our current facility available for future expansion of our cgmp manufacturing capacity 
we may be required to make additional investments in our joint venture with mcneil specialty to fund capital expenditures 
if the joint venture builds additional production facilities  and we wish to maintain our ownership interest in the joint venture  we are required to invest up to million to fund half of such expenditures 
however  we may elect to fund as little as million of the cost of the facilities  so long as our aggregate investments in the joint venture are at least of the joint venture s aggregate capital expenditures 
in this case  mcneil specialty will fund the remainder of our half of the joint venture s capital expenditures  and our ownership percentage will be proportionately reduced 
we have an option  expiring in september  to return to ownership of the joint venture by reimbursing mcneil specialty for this amount 
in  we issued  through the montgomery county pennsylvania industrial development authority  million of taxable and tax exempt bonds 
the bonds were issued to finance the purchase of our previously leased building and the construction of a pilot scale manufacturing facility within our building 
the bonds are supported by an aa rated letter of credit  and a reimbursement agreement between our bank and the letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate on the bonds will vary weekly  depending on market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations  respectively 
during  the weighted average  effective interest rate was per year  including letter of credit and other fees 
the terms of the bond issuance provide for monthly  interest only payments and a single repayment of principal at the end of the twenty year life of the bonds 
however  under our agreement with our bank  we are making monthly payments to an escrow account to provide for an annual prepayment of principal 
as of december   we had restricted funds relating to the bonds of  which consisted of our monthly payments to an escrow account plus interest revenue on the balance of the escrow account 
to provide credit support for this arrangement  we have given a first mortgage on the land  building  improvements  and certain machinery and equipment to our bank 
we have also agreed to a covenant  which was renegotiated in may  to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least two times the current loan balance 
at december   we were required to maintain a cash and short term investments balance of million  rather than million as required under the original covenant 
if we fail to comply with this covenant  we are required to deposit with the lender cash collateral up to  but not more than  the loan s unpaid balance  which was million as of december  we expect that our existing cash and short term investments will be adequate to fund our operations through at least  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and short term investments sooner than the above estimate 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including if or when any products manufactured using our technology are commercialized 
joint venture with mcneil specialty our joint venture with mcneil specialty is owned equally by neose and mcneil specialty 
each of neose and mcneil specialty contributed various intellectual property to the joint venture 
in addition  mcneil specialty contributed to the joint venture the pilot manufacturing facility  for which of the cost will be reimbursed by the joint venture 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method  under which we recognize our share of the income and losses of the joint venture 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our initial investment in the joint venture of approximately  to zero to reflect our share of the joint venture s losses 
we recorded this amount as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we will record our share of post losses of the joint venture  however  only to the extent of our actual or committed investment in the joint venture 
if the joint venture becomes profitable  we will recognize our share of the joint venture s profits only after the amount of our capital contributions to the joint venture is equivalent to our share of the joint venture s accumulated losses 
as of december   the joint venture had an accumulated loss since inception of approximately million  of which our share is approximately million 
until the joint venture is profitable  mcneil specialty is required to fund  as a non recourse  no interest loan  all of the joint venture s aggregate capital expenditures in excess of an agreed upon amount  and all of the joint venture s operating losses 
the loan balance would be repayable by the joint venture to mcneil specialty over a seven year period commencing on the earlier of september  or the date on which neose attains a ownership interest in the joint venture after having had a lesser ownership interest 
in the event of any dissolution of the joint venture  the loan balance would be payable to mcneil specialty before any distribution of assets to us 
as of december   the joint venture owed mcneil specialty approximately million
