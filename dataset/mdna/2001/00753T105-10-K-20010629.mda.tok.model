the percent increase in net sales can be attributed primarily to increases in gross shipments to core customers and  to a lesser extent  the ramping up of our new sales relationship with the borders group and increased sales from international divisions 
we experienced a percent rate of returns from customers in fiscal  consistent with the fiscal rate

gross profit for fiscal reached  an increase of  from the fiscal level 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit was percent in fiscal compared with percent in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit margin was primarily a result of increased sales of higher margin juvenile and ams published books as well as reduced sales of lower margin bestsellers 
additional margin contribution came from our international subsidiaries and publisher incentive programs due in part to a refinement in our method of estimating income under these programs 
distribution and administrative expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal as a percentage of sales  these expenses rose to percent from percent for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was due primarily to our continuing goal to diversify our worldwide customer base  our commitment to build the infrastructure required to address heightened business requirements on a global level and a  increase in existing reserves for receivables due to a customer s filing for chapter bankruptcy protection 
the infrastructure costs included hiring for key new positions and increased depreciation expense related to systems enhancements and facility expansions

table of contents seasonality our net sales and earnings in the third fiscal quarter have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  significantly higher than in any other quarter due to the holiday season 
income from operations during the third fiscal quarter  as a percentage of net sales  is typically higher than in any other quarter because of product sales mix and other economies of scale caused by the higher sales volume 
we expect seasonality in operations to continue 
we experience significant seasonal short term swings in our cash position due to sales seasonality and to differences in timing of payments to our vendors and the receipt of payments from our customers 
cash flow has been historically greatest during the third fiscal quarter due to higher seasonal sales 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march   operating activities provided  of cash 
in the prior year  operating activities provided  of cash 
at march   our cash and cash equivalents and investments had decreased by  compared to march   primarily due to funding of acquisitions  stock repurchases and the strategic growth of our corporate infrastructure offset  in part  by income from operations 
trade accounts receivable increased  compared to one year ago primarily due to an increase in net sales 
inventories at march  decreased  compared to march   due in part to increased sales as well as an increased focus on inventory management 
accounts payable increased by  compared to march   due primarily to increased purchases to support increased sales 
the working capital required to finance inventories is directly related to inventory turnover rate and trade credit terms provided by publishers 
trade credit terms from our vendors did not change significantly during fiscal inventory turns increased to times in fiscal from times in fiscal the improvement in inventory turns is a result of purchasing efficiencies gained from a better understanding of our customers needs through the use of our proprietary vmi software program 
we had available at march  an unsecured bank line of credit with a maximum borrowing limit of  the interest rate on bank borrowings is based on the prime rate and libor rates 
the line of credit expires on august  as of and during the years ended march  and march   we had no borrowings on our bank line of credit 
we believe that our existing working capital  cash flows from operations  trade credit traditionally available from our vendors and our  bank line of credit will be sufficient to finance our current and anticipated level of operations 
although we have no commitments to do so at the present time  we intend to consider additional strategic acquisitions where deemed appropriate 
such acquisitions  if any  could affect our liquidity and capital resources 
impact of inflation we have been subject to relatively low prevailing inflation rates in all countries in which we operate  with the exception of mexico  during fiscal  and we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices in all countries in which we operate to offset increased costs of merchandise and we expect to be able to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
while our mexico operations are not a significant part of our overall activities  the continued high rates of inflation in mexico may result in future foreign currency exchange losses

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to changes in interest rates primarily from securities held in our investment portfolio 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the ending fair value of our investments  anticipated future cash flows  and the realization of earnings from such investments 
our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid short term investments that are typically held for the duration of the respective instrument 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our cash equivalents 
as of march   our investments of approximately  are scheduled to mature within one year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions  or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
accordingly  we believe that  while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
we are subject to foreign currency exposure due to the operation of our foreign subsidiaries  which generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exposure are the british pound  mexican peso  and the australian and canadian dollar 
we generally view as long term our investments in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not utilize any hedging transactions against these net investments 
our foreign operations are not a significant part of our overall activities and we believe that the risk associated with our foreign currency exposure is not material on a consolidated basis 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
was amended in june by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and in june by sfas no 
for accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
they require that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value with changes form fair value reflected in operations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 in april  and we believe the effect of the adoption will be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements
