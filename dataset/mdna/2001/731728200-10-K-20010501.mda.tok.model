development costs for new products are expected to continue in fiscal  but at reduced levels 
investment tax credits are claimed by dextran products to offset the cost of research and development

as a result of the foregoing  the company recorded net income of  in fiscal as compared to a net income of  in fiscal certain events occurring in fiscal could have an impact on future results as follows 
the foot and mouth disease problem in europe  following so closely on the heels of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak  may be of concern 
dextran products has been in contact with its agents overseas and to date the problem seems to be more related to sheep and cattle 
the modern practice of isolating pig units for health reasons and taking the animals directly to slaughter has limited the impact on this sector 
the iron dextran sold by dextran products is mainly for treatment of pigs 
the situation is  however  very fluid and the company continues to be in contact with its distributors 
feedback from asia  europe and the united states shows limited effect to date 
the impact of the foot and mouth disease problem has had minimal impact on vet labs 
the company is conducting part of its research through collaboration with scientists from the program for the topical prevention of conception and disease topcad based at the rush presbyterian st 
luke s medical center and the university of illinois in chicago 
the company continues to be supported by assistance from the contraceptive research and development program conrad

the company licensed the cystic fibrosis product  usherdex  to bcy lifesciences inc bcy lifesciences of vancouver  british columbia 
under this license agreement  bcy lifesciences will provide funding for research and development and will pay a royalty to the company based on sales and sublicensing revenue in return for the exclusive right to sublicense  manufacture  distribute and sell the product or products developed 
bcy lifesciences has since raised funds to continue the research and development of the product 
bcy lifesciences successfully completed an animal toxicology study during fiscal and expects to begin a phase i clinical trial in the next one to two years 
vet labs has a raw material supplier that continues to have regulatory problems with their production of pentobarbital used in euthanasia product 
consequently  this has limited the production and related sale of euthanasia products by vet labs during fiscal during the year  the united states food and drug administration fda did grant an emergency release of raw materials by the supplier  which allowed vet labs to produce and sell some euthanasia products 
the release by the fda was granted because of the short supply of euthanasia products in the field 
management expects future sales of these products to remain limited until the supplier resolves their regulatory problems or until another manufacturer is approved

there were large sales at chemdex at year end in fiscal  which increased the year end receivables balance 
the increase in inventory levels was due to forecasted stocking for february sales 
during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal this decrease is a result of the large additions of production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in fiscal the change in the accumulated other comprehensive income is entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to us dollars 
during fiscal  the company negotiated an extension of payment terms on the long term debt due to contigroup companies  inc under the new terms  semi annual repayments of  will be required on may and november each year commencing may  with a final lump sum payment of  on november  management anticipates funding these payments with cash from existing operations

the vet labs sparhawk joint venture has a  line of credit to fund operations 
vet labs has a loan commitment for  to be used for building construction

there are no scheduled production interruptions as a result of this refurbishing in fiscal although management believes that production interruptions will be minimal  management is developing contingency plans in case there are unexpected production interruptions 
when fully complete  management expects the refurbishing to increase capacity by to with increased operating efficiencies 
until the refurbishing is complete  however  there could be decreases in profit margins due to the increased overhead costs and unexpected production interruptions 
management s primary objective at vet labs is product development and marketing of licensed products 
these licensed products require individual approval by the united states food and drug administration fda and consequently offer greater profit margins
