item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are an internet solutions provider offering broadband data communication services and enhanced products and services to businesses in selected high growth second tier markets in the northeastern united states 
our services included high speed data and internet services  data center services  including web hosting and managed and unmanaged colocation services  small office home office soho internet access  wholesale isp services  and various professional services including web design and development 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on businesses in the markets we serve using the value proposition of leveraging our technical expertise with world class customer care 
we approach our customers from an access independent position  providing connectivity over a variety of available technologies 
these include classic telco provided point to point  isdn  smds  atm  and dsl 
we also offer fastnet controlled last mile internet access utilizing wireless transport 
on february   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
on march   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option 
we received aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering and exercise of the over allotment option 
on march   we acquired all the assets and substantially all the liabilities of cybertech wireless  inc cybertech  a provider of wireless high speed internet access  web hosting and soho access located in new york state 
cybertech has deployed wireless networks in rochester  syracuse  albany and buffalo 
once the integration is complete  we believe we will be able to offer our customers in the new york region the full suite of products and services offered to customers in our pennsylvania and new jersey markets 
we will also utilize cybertech s network deployment knowledge to build out wireless networks in selected existing fastnet markets 
as of december   we provided internet access and enhanced services to enterprise customers   soho customers  and  customers using our web hosting  and colocation services 
our history of operating losses we have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect our losses to continue through december  as we seek to execute our revised business plan 
our net losses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
modification of our strategic plan on october   we modified our strategic plan 
this modified plan called for the suspension of selling and marketing efforts in of the markets that were operational as of september  our selling and marketing strategy is focused on markets located in pennsylvania  new jersey and new york 
the company has also changed its sales model to a consultative  face to face approach rather than the centralized telemarketing approach 
we believe our increased focus on a smaller number of markets  in conjunction with the consultative sales approach will enable us to engage more customers in our target markets and retain customers for longer periods of time 
we are also building a customer centric culture highlighted by superior customer care and technical support departments 
we expect this increased focus on customer care will help us build and maintain long term relationships with our customers 
we have modified our value proposition from being a low cost provider to focusing on building a reputation of being an authority on internet enabled solutions with exceptional customer care 
our modified plan includes redesigning our network architecture and an overall reduction in telecommunication expenses 
we will eliminate the outbound bandwidth in the markets where field sales efforts were suspended 
the market based infrastructure in the eight operational markets is being reconfigured to reduce costs while still achieving reliability and redundancy of the network by maintaining multiple connections to the worldwide internet backbone providers 
we believe these changes will have a favorable impact on our gross margins that will be evident in as part of the restructuring plan  on october   we terminated employees throughout all departments of the company 
this payroll and related expense reduction will result in reduced selling  general  and administrative expense  thereby  reducing our cash burn rate 
in addition to these cost containment actions  we have reduced the planned capital expenditures for as a result of our modified strategic plan  we believe that the cash and investments we have available will be sufficient to fund operations through without requiring us to raise any additional cash 
simultaneous with the modification of our strategic plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million primarily related to network and telecommunication optimization and cost reduction  facility exit costs  realigned marketing strategy  and involuntary employee terminations see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the activity in the restructuring charge accrual during is summarized in the table below accrued cash restructuring restructuring payments as of charge during december  telecommunications exit and termination fees 
   leasehold termination costs    termination payments to employees   sales and marketing contract terminations    facility exit costs    during the fourth quarter of  based upon a review of the company s long lived assets  the company recorded a non cash charge of million primarily related to the write down of a portion of the asset values of the components of several of the company s customer network facilities 
the company idled operations in these facilities upon adoption of the company s revised business plan 
an impairment was recognized as the future undiscounted cash flows of each facility were estimated to be insufficient to recover their related carrying values 
as such  the carrying values of these assets were written down to the company s estimates of their fair value 
results of operations revenues we provide services to our customers  which we classify in three general types internet access and enhanced services  soho internet access  and dialplex virtual private network vpn services 
we target our internet access and enhanced services to businesses located within our active markets 
fastnet offers a broad range of dedicated access solutions including t  t  frame relay  smds  enterprise class digital subscriber line dsl services and fixed broadband wireless 
our enhanced services are complementary to dedicated internet access and include total managed security and the sale of third party hardware and software 
we also classify our dedicated and shared web hosting and colocation services as part of our enhanced services 
our business plan focuses on the core service offering of internet access coupled with add on sales of enhanced products and services as our customers internet needs expand 
access and enhanced revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we expect our access and enhanced revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues as we continue to focus additional resources on marketing and promoting these services 
the market for data and related services is becoming increasingly competitive 
we seek to continue to expand our customer base by both increasing market penetration in our existing markets and by increasing average revenue per customer by selling additional enhanced products and services 
we have had a historically low churn rate with our dedicated internet customers 
we believe as the industry consolidates that we will have opportunities to migrate customers from our competitors as their customers become dissatisfied with the level of service provided by the consolidated organizations 
in addition  the recent economic challenges have caused other providers to either cease operations or terminate certain product offerings 
we seek to grow our revenues by capturing market share from other providers 
our soho revenues consist of dial up internet access to both residential and small office business customers  soho dsl internet access  and integrated services digital network isdn internet access 
customers using our soho services generally sign service contracts for one to two years 
we typically bill these services in advance of providing services 
as a result  revenues are deferred until such time as services are rendered 
in the future as we execute our business plan  we expect soho revenues to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
we have reduced selling and marketing efforts targeted to this customer base in response to increased competition from both free internet service providers and other providers 
we also offer our customers virtual private network vpn solutions 
vpn s allow business customers secure  remote access to their internal networks through a connection to fastnet s network 
the cost of these services varies with the scope of the services provided 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of our internet connectivity charges and network charges 
these are our costs of directly connecting to multiple internet backbones and maintaining our network 
cost of revenues also includes engineering payroll  creative and programming staff payrolls for web design and development and  the cost of third party hardware and software that we sell to our customers  facility rental expense for in market network infrastructure  and rental expense on network equipment financed under operating leases 
the following table sets forth statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  revenues operating expenses cost of services selling  general and administrative 
depreciation and amortization restructuring charge asset impairment operating loss other expense income expense  net net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is primarily a result of an increase in business customers using our dedicated internet access and web hosting services 
our dedicated internet access customer base grew by from as of december  to as of december  our web hosting customer base grew by from  as of december  to  as of december  partially offsetting this increase in customers was a decrease in the average revenue per customer during as compared to this was the result of the addition of enterprise dsl customers into our dedicated internet access customer base 
we expect future revenue growth to be primarily generated from our dedicated internet access and web hosting product lines 
for the year ended december   we derived million or of our revenues from microsoft s webtv networks inc  as compared to million or of our revenues for the year ended december  during  we began offering our dialplex network coverage in additional markets that resulted in increased revenue from webtv 
however  in september  we reduced the price we charge webtv for our wholesale dialplex services 
we seek to use this price reduction to continue encouraging webtv to increase the volume of business it purchases from us 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increases in our network coverage areas  as well as increases in the capacity of our network including capacity we suspended in october of during  we added additional connectivity at our network operations center 
gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin was a result of installation of telecommunication circuits in new markets before we generated any revenues in those new markets and an increase in engineering personnel 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced network costs by re designing the network to take advantage of cost saving opportunities while providing greater capacity than was previously available 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in selling  general and administrative personnel from at december  to a high of at september  as a result of the restructuring  selling  general and administrative personnel decreased to at december  also contributing to this increase was marketing and advertising expense incurred to gain brand awareness in markets 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed our marketing approach to targeted direct advertising in an effort to reduce expenses 
in addition  the reduction in operational markets from as of september  to eight at december  should result in lower selling  general  and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is comprised of depreciation on the market based network facilities and networking equipment located in those facilities 
also contributing to the increase was million of amortization expense for the year ended december  that related to the intangible assets recorded in the purchase accounting of internet unlimited as compared to the  of amortization expense recorded during the last six months of other income expense 
interest income increased by million from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in interest income was generated from the investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering on february  interest expense increased by  from  for year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as we financed equipment needed for our market expansion under capital lease arrangements 
we expect interest income to decrease as we use our cash to fund our operating losses and interest expense to increase as we continue to service our capital lease obligations 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis  assuming our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc occurred prior to january   total revenues would have been million for the year ended december  service revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of customers using our dedicated internet access services and a increase in virtual private network revenues from  for the period ended december  to million for the period ended december  this increase in virtual private networking revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues from one customer  microsoft s webtv networks 
our enhanced products and service revenues increased by for the period ended december  over the same period in in part due to our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc our dial up customer base continued to grow over the comparable period  resulting in an increase in dial up revenues of for the period ended december  over the same twelve month period in hardware and software revenues which represents our resale of third party hardware and software to our customers decreased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we sold a significant amount of third party hardware and software as part of an installation for one of our major customers 
these customers historically have required less hardware because of the scale of their internet needs and their inclination to use their existing equipment when available 
during these periods  we derived a significant portion of our revenues from microsoft s webtv networks and the state of delaware 
microsoft s webtv networks represented of total revenues for the year ended december  the state of delaware represented of total revenues for the year ended december cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis  assuming our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc occurred prior to january   cost of revenues would have been million for the year ended december  cost of service revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of services revenues  cost of services were in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  these increases were primarily attributable to the increase in internet access and telecommunications charges  increased rental expense on leased equipment  and an increase in payroll and related expenses for engineers associated with our increased revenues  in advance of generating revenues in new regions 
cost of hardware and software decreased by  or to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in hardware and software revenues

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in selling  general and administrative personnel from at december  to at december   and a increase in advertising expense from  in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  as a result of the increase in personnel  all related general and administrative expenses increased 
 of the million increase was for financial advisory services 
on a pro forma basis  assuming our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc occurred prior to january   selling  general and administrative expenses would have been million for the year ended december depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million or  to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the purchase of equipment necessary to support the expansion of our network and to the amortization of the intangible assets associated with our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc on a pro forma basis  assuming our acquisition of internet unlimited  inc occurred prior to january   depreciation and amortization  including the amortization of intangible assets associated with the internet unlimited acquisition would have been million for the year ended december  cash flows analysis year ended december  other financial data cash flows used in operating activities    cash flows used in investing activities    cash flows provided by financing activities 
   net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash flows used by operating activities increased by million from cash used of  in the year ended december  to million cash used in the year ended december  this increase in cash used in operations is primarily the result of our net loss of million 
the increase in net loss is primarily a result of an increase in personnel from at december  to a high of and declining as a result of the revised business plan to at december   as well as an increase in telecommunication charges and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to support the expansion of the company during the first part of also contributing to the net loss for the year ended december   was the restructuring charge of million and non cash asset impairment charge of million 
we expect to continue to incur losses until the operating markets provide sufficient gross margin to cover both market operating costs as well as corporate infrastructure 
cash used in investing activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase in cash outflows is primarily attributable to the company s purchases of marketable securities and an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities increased by million from cash inflows of million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash flows from financing activities is a result of the proceeds from the company s initial public offering and exercise of the underwriters over allotment partially offset by the repayments of capital lease and debt obligations 
liquidity and capital resources the business plan we executed at the time of our ipo required substantial capital to fund operations  capital expenditures  expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  and acquisitions 
we modified our business strategy in october see recent developments to allow us to maintain operations without any additional funding into simultaneous with the modification of our strategic plan  we recorded a non recurring charge primarily related to network and telecommunication optimization and cost reduction  facility exit costs  realigned marketing strategy  and involuntary employee terminations 
we expect these actions will reduce our cash consumption rate in the future  but may result in early termination payments for certain contractual obligations that exist 
as of december   we had million in cash and marketable securities 
we believe that the cash and investments we have available will be sufficient to fund operations into during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge for  of this restructuring charge   has not been paid as of december  and is  accordingly  classified as accrued restructuring 
the company anticipates that the entire amount accrued will be paid in the restructuring charges were determined based on formal plans approved by the company s management and board of directors using the information available at the time 
management of the company believes this provision will be adequate to cover any future costs incurred relating to the restructuring 
prior to our initial public offering  we satisfied our cash requirements primarily through debt and equity financings 
in may  we issued  shares of our common stock  a convertible promissory note of million and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share to h q you tools investment holding  lp for an aggregate of approximately million in cash 
in connection with this financing  we granted h q you tools investment holding  lp a security interest in substantially all of our assets

the net proceeds from these sales of series a convertible preferred stock were approximately million 
all of the outstanding preferred stock automatically converted into common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the initial public offering 
in june  we entered into an agreement with ascend credit corporation for a million equipment lease facility

currently  we have approximately million available under this facility

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
our financial instruments primarily consist of debt 
all of our debt instruments bear interest at fixed rates 
therefore  a change in interest rates would not affect the interest incurred or cash flows related to our debt 
a change in interest rates would  however  affect the fair value of the debt 
the following sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from levels at december  with all other factors held constant 
a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would result in a change in the value of our debt of less than  at december  because our debt is neither publicly traded nor redeemable at our option  it is unlikely that such a change would impact our financial statements or results of operations 
all of our transactions are conducted using the united states dollar 
therefore  we are not exposed to any significant market risk relating to currency rates
