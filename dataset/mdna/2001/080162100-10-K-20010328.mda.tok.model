item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the data presented in this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the year marked the beginning of the recovery of belmont bancorp 
from substantial loan losses incurred during and during  the company successfully completed equity offerings that began in november and concluded in june with a total of million in new capital and  shares of common stock issued 
support from its shareholders and depositors has enabled the company to return to profitability and potentially allow for future growth 
the following table depicts the performance of the company over the past three years 
s except per share data income loss before income taxes   net income loss    basic earnings loss per common share return on average assets return on average total equity for the year ended  the company reported net income of  or per common share compared to a loss of  or a loss of per common share for the year ended for  the company had reported a loss of  or a loss of per share 
income before federal income tax benefits was  for the year ended compared to pretax losses of  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the financial results of and reflect a period when belmont faced one of the most serious challenges in its year history 
the resignation of the bank s chief operating officer and senior lending officer in march followed by the closure in april and subsequent bankruptcy of schwartz homes  inc  formerly the bank s largest commercial borrower  precipitated the recognition of large loan losses 
in june  belmont s chief executive officer resigned  and the board of directors engaged an interim management group to provide executive management services and to assist in the recruitment of a new chief executive officer 
throughout  the bank s staff worked diligently to assess the magnitude of the losses associated with schwartz homes  inc and related consumer loans and to evaluate the entire commercial loan portfolio 
the performance of the company during was severely impacted by loan losses and additional overhead costs associated with interim management  legal services  and collection efforts 
loan charge offs during totaled  and the loan loss provision was  new loan policies and procedures were implemented to augment internal controls and strengthen underwriting practices 
in december  a new chief executive officer was recruited and costs associated with interim executive management were eliminated 
in march  a confirmation order was approved by the court in the schwartz homes  inc bankruptcy 
for the year ended december   the bank received settlement proceeds of million of which million was applied to the remaining credit exposure for the schwartz homebuilder loans  million was recorded as recoveries in the allowance for loan losses  and the remaining funds were recorded as recovery of legal expenses 
the company continued to face unusually high operating expenses for the year ended in particular  large legal expenses  deposit insurance costs  and other insurance costs hindered profitability 
legal expenses were in excess of million for the year  and fdic deposit insurance and other insurance costs increased by over  from the previous year 
for  the company recorded a loan loss provision of  resulting in a loss of  or a loss of per common share 
of this loan loss provision   was recorded in the fourth quarter of and related to consumer loans to customers of schwartz homes  inc net interest revenue a major share of the company s income results from the spread between income on interest earning assets and interest expense on the liabilities used to fund those assets  known as net interest income 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and amounts and distributions of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by the average earning assets outstanding 
a third frequently used measure is net interest rate spread which is the difference between the average rate earned on assets and the average rate incurred on liabilities without regard to the amounts outstanding in either category 
the consolidated average balance sheets and analysis of net interest income changes compare interest revenue and interest earning assets outstanding with interest cost and liabilities outstanding for the years ended december    and  and compute net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period 
all three of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis

this table shows that the decrease in the company s net interest income during the year to date periods presented from to was generated primarily by a decline in the volume of earning assets which was partially offset by an improvement in the yield of earning assets 
the decrease in the company s net interest income during the year to date periods presented from to was principally due to a decline in yields and volume on earning assets 
this was partially offset by a decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities

service charges on deposits increased from  in to  in due to higher overdrafts and return check fee income and an increase in the fee schedule for commercial checking accounts 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded  in interest earned on federal tax refunds for taxes paid in previous years 
a loss of  was recognized during for loans sold compared to a  gain recorded during and a  gain in securities losses were realized during the fourth quarter of as part of a plan to reduce the asset size of the bank 
in october  the bank sold approximately million in investment securities for a loss of  and used approximately million of the proceeds to repay borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of borrowings totaled  and are included in operating expenses

taxes were also lower by  from to this reduction was primarily the result of refunds for state corporate net income and franchise taxes previously paid which totaled  due to reductions in income and equity 
insurance expense was impacted by higher premium rates for federal deposit insurance from the fdic 
fdic deposit premiums for the year were  compared to  for and  for fdic costs are expected to decline during based on the improvement in the bank s capital ratios as of september   the measurement date for fdic assessments for the first half of fidelity bond and director and officer liability insurance costs also increased by  from to based on new policies obtained during july amortization of intangible assets during was related to mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated value of mortgage servicing rights at the end of was  for a mortgage servicing porfolio of million 
the balance of core deposit intangible assets associated with branches acquired in the early s were written off during the fourth quarter of the write off resulted in the recognition of an additional  in amortization expense for the period 
these intangible assets were primarily associated with the deposits acquired in the new philadelphia market 
given the negative publicity surrounding the schwartz commercial and consumer loans centered in this marketplace and the resulting decline in deposits  the bank reevaluated the remaining intangible assets and determined that it would write off the balance 
amortization of core deposit intangibles for was  legal expenses were for costs related to lending and loan collection efforts  civil litigation against progressive insurance and others related to the schwartz homes  inc matters  regulatory matters  and a shareholder action against the company  the board of directors and several current and former officers of the bank

examination and audit expense declined slightly during compared to this cost had increased from to primarily as the result of a change in external auditors  the contract internal auditor  and the additional loan review and extended scopes of the engagements as a result of lending related issues 
prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of borrowings at the federal home loan bank totaled  during these costs were incurred as part of the plan to reduce the asset size of the company thereby improving the bank s capital ratios 
no repayment penalties were incurred during legal settlement expense for totaled  compared to  for this expense was related to the schwartz homes  inc litigation 
other expenses incurred in and were significantly less than the expense incurred in  principally due to expenses associated with interim management services retained during the last half of financial condition securities the company uses securities to generate interest and dividend revenue  to manage interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to meet operating cash needs 
the securities portfolio yield at december  was 
net unrealized losses in the securities portfolio at december  totaled  compared to net unrealized losses of  at december  the decline in unrealized losses was the result of a lower interest rate environment at december  compared to december  bond prices rise as interest rates decline

at december   the company owned various investments in a single issuer  the book value of which exceeded of total shareholders equity

credit evaluations of borrowers are performed to ensure that loans are granted on a sound basis 
in addition  care is taken to minimize risk by diversifying specific industry 
the bank has certain concentrations of credit  which are more fully described in footnote of the company s financial statements beginning on page f management regularly monitors credit risk through the periodic review of individual credits to ensure compliance with policies and procedures 
adequate collateralization  contractual guarantees  and compensating balances are also utilized by management to mitigate risk 
management determines the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses by regularly evaluating the quality of the loan portfolio 
the reserve is allocated to specific loans that exhibit above average credit loss potential based upon their payment history and the borrowers financial conditions 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated based on an assessment of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this assessment results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
the allocations are made for analytical purposes 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management maintains a watch list of substandard loans for monthly review 
although these loans may not be delinquent and may be adequately secured  management believes that due to location  size  or past payment history  it is necessary to monitor these loans monthly 
the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans and leases at december  at the end of the previous year  the allowance for loan losses was  or of total loans and leases 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense during was  compared to  in the year ago period 
as previously disclosed  the bank has taken charge offs beginning with the fourth quarter of due principally to its relationship with schwartz homes  inc  a defunct retailer of mobile homes formerly based in new philadelphia  ohio and retail customers of schwartz homes 
the bank made loans to schwartz home s retail customers under recourse agreements with schwartz homes 
under these recourse agreements  schwartz homes agreed to repay any loans not repaid by retail customers 
schwartz homes apparently used the funds advanced by the bank to fund its own operations or for other improper purposes  without the knowledge of the bank s board 
in many instances  schwartz homes failed to perform on the retail sales contracts it entered into with its customers even though the bank had provided the funds to schwartz homes for this purpose 
in addition  schwartz homes often failed to repay the floor plan lenders on homes purchased  which further impacted the bank s collateral position with respect to the homes 
in april  schwartz homes unexpectedly ceased operations and in june other creditors of schwartz homes placed it in involuntary bankruptcy 
in march  a confirmation order was approved by the court in the schwartz homes  inc bankruptcy 
for the year ended december   the bank received settlement proceeds of million of which million was applied to the remaining credit exposure for the schwartz homebuilder loans  million was recorded as recoveries in the allowance for loan losses  and the remaining funds were recorded as recovery of legal expenses 
of the million in net charge offs for the year ended december   were related to the schwartz homes loan relationship 
there are no remaining loans outstanding related to schwartz homes or its customers at december  of the million in net charge offs for the year ended december   million were related to schwartz homes loans 
of this million amount  million in net charge offs were related to the indirect consumer loans to schwartz homes customers  and million in net charge offs were related to commercial loans made directly to schwartz homes 
of the million in net charge offs for the year ended december   million were related to the schwartz homes consumer loans

in addition to the above schedule of non performing assets  management prepares a watch list consisting of loans which management has determined require closer monitoring to further protect the company against loss 
the balance of loans classified by management as substandard due to delinquency and a change in financial position and not included in non performing assets was  and  at the december  and  respectively 
loan classified as doubtful and not included in non performing assets totaled  at december  there were no loans classified as doubtful at december  deposits primarily  core deposits are used to fund interest earning assets

the negative publicity resulting from the bank s loan losses had an adverse impact on bank deposits 
in addition  the bank actively reduced deposits to shrink its asset size thereby reducing the amount of capital required to meet the terms of its regulatory agreements 
there was also a sale of million in deposits during january of deposit trends have increased during the last half of average deposits for the fourth quarter of were million  up million from the third quarter of borrowings other sources of funds for the company include short term repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources the company meets its liability based needs through the operation of the bank s branch banking network that gathers demand and retail time deposits 
the bank also acquires funds through repurchase agreements and overnight federal funds that provide additional sources of liquidity 
total deposits decreased by million  or  from the end of to and million  or  from the end of to as discussed above  these trends were the result of adverse publicity surrounding the bank s financial condition  planned reductions in deposit levels to facilitate capital restoration and a branch sale 
average deposits decreased million  or  during compared to average deposits decreased million  or  during compared to deposit trends stabilized midyear during and increased during the third and fourth quarters of the bank also has lines of credit with various correspondent banks totaling  that may be used as an alternative funding source  none of these lines were drawn upon at december  the bank has an unused credit line with the federal home loan bank for million 
all borrowings at the federal home loan bank are subject to eligible collateral requirements 
liquidity may be impacted by the ability of the company to generate future earnings 
at december   shareholders equity was million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in capital occurred as a result of the sale of common stock during and an improvement in the market value of securities classified as available for sale 
the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines also define and set minimum capital requirements risk based capital ratios 
bank holding companies are required to have core capital tier of at least of risk weighted assets and total capital of of risk weighted assets 
tier capital consists principally of shareholders equity less goodwill  and may include a portion of deferred tax assets 
however  presently none of the company s deferred tax assets are included as tier capital 
total capital consists of tier i capital  plus certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses

as a result of its recapitalization efforts  the bank was formally notified that it had achieved an adequately capitalized designation under prompt corrective action regulations as of june  in a letter from the office of the comptroller of the currency dated july  there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes has changed the bank s capital category 
see also notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
dividends the following table presents dividend payout ratios for the past three years total dividends declared as a percentage of net income common dividends declared as a percentage of earnings per common share not applicable because the company reported losses for and cash dividends were declared and paid in the amount of per share in prior to the company s determination that it would not realize positive earnings for the year 
dividends of per share were paid in future dividends will require approval of the company s regulators 
the subsidiary bank is the primary source of funds to pay dividends to the shareholders of the company 
the approval of the comptroller of the currency will be required for future dividends from the bank to the company because previously paid dividends have exceeded the total of the bank s retained net profits for the current and preceding two years 
the board of governors of the federal reserve bank has issued a policy statement stating that a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common stock unless the organization s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements currently  there are no recent accounting pronouncements that  if adopted  would have a material effect on the company s financial position 
forward looking statements various statements made in this report concerning the manner in which belmont intends to conduct its future operations  and potential trends that may impact future results of operations  are forward looking statements 
belmont may be unable to realize its plans and objectives due to various important factors  including  but not limited to  the factors described below 
these and other factors are more fully discussed elsewhere in this report 

belmont has entered into consent agreements with the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the office of the comptroller of the currency that require it to take various actions and meet various requirements 
if belmont fails to satisfy all of these requirements  the comptroller of the currency and federal reserve bank could potentially assume complete or significantly greater control of belmont s operations 

belmont has recognized substantial loan losses in recent years  principally related to loans made under the direction of prior management 
while belmont has created what it believes are appropriate loan loss reserves  belmont could incur significant additional loan losses in future periods  particularly if general economic conditions or conditions in particular industries in which its loans are concentrated deteriorate 

belmont is subject to increasingly vigorous and intense competition from other banking institutions and from various financial institutions and other nonbank or non regulated companies or firms that engage in similar activities 
many of these institutions have significantly greater resources than belmont 

belmont is currently engaged in certain significant lawsuits 
in addition to making significant expenditures for legal fees  adverse judgments in one or more of these lawsuits could have a materially adverse impact on belmont s financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
the company s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the asset liability management committee alco meets regularly to review the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the goal of asset liability management is to maximize net interest income and the net value of the company s future cash flows within the interest rate risk limits established by the board of directors 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of two complementary measures earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of these interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company 
the key assumptions underlying these measures are periodically reviewed by alco 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on income under a variety of scenarios 
this model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds 
based on the earnings simulation model at december   changes in net interest income were projected as follows given a parallel shift in the yield curve change in change net interest in net interest expressed in thousands income income down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points based on the earnings simulation model at december   changes in net interest income were projected as follows given a parallel shift in the yield curve change in change net interest in net interest expressed in thousands income income down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points the net present value estimation npv measure is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the earnings simulation model due to the shorter time horizon used by that model 
the npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
the npv measure also assumes a static balance sheet  versus the growth assumptions that are incorporated into the earnings simulation measure and an unlimited time horizon instead of the one year horizon applied in the earnings simulation 
as with earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are important to npv analysis 
the estimated decline in the present value of equity as a percentage of the total market value of equity at december  would be given a basis point increase in interest rates
