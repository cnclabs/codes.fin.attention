item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for historical information contained herein  the statements in this item are forward looking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which may cause safenet s actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results 
those risks include  among others  risks associated with the receipt and timing of future customer orders  price pressures  achieving technical and product development milestones  the ability to negotiate favorable strategic oem agreements  sufficient cash flow to support safenet s liquidity requirements  other competitive factors leading to a decrease in anticipated revenues and gross profit margins and product development expenses 
overview safenet designs  manufactures and markets enterprise network security solutions using encryption technology 
our products are used in electronic commerce applications by financial institutions  government agencies and large corporations to secure data transmissions on private and public computer networks  such as the internet 
our european operations design  manufacture and market cryptographic equipment primarily in switzerland and europe 
safenet s historical operating results have been dependent on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the timing of orders from and shipments to clients  product development expenses and the timing of development and introduction of new products 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
the size and timing of our historical revenues have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  the results of a particular period  or period to period comparisons of recorded sales and profits may not be indicative of future operating results 
while management is committed to the long term profitability of safenet  the recent growth of the computer security industry has made it important that market share be obtained 
we have undertaken various strategies in order to increase our revenues and improve our future operating results  including new product offerings such as our safenet products for the internet and the safenet security center tm  a high performance workstation that automatically manages safenet products and the development of integrated circuits for the original equipment market 
management believes that growth in the market for products that provide secure remote access to computer networks requires safenet to increase its investment in development  sales and marketing activities to allow safenet to take advantage of this market opportunity and to achieve long term profitability thereby maximizing shareholder value 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful

the segments are strategic business units that offer different products 
the segments are managed separately because each segment requires different technology and marketing strategies see note to the audited consolidated financial statements

general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the period ended december   from  in the increase is primarily due to professional fees incurred to export software developed in the united states to the european operations segment  costs associated with strengthening the executive management team in both the us and europe  and professional services related to strategic initiative planning

in august  safenet signed a two year joint development and marketing agreement with cyberguard corporation cyberguard 
the companies intended to develop and market a product that combined safenet s products and cyberguard s firewall product 
in connection therewith  we prepaid a refundable license fee to cyberguard 
in june  a distribution agreement and an original equipment agreement replaced the original agreement 
under these agreements  cyberguard agreed to repay on december  the original  advance less used license fees and a right to manufacture fee 
cyberguard failed to honor its obligation to repay the unused license fee 
since we could not ascertain the ultimate viability of cyberguard as a result of its august announcement that it was experiencing significant pressure on its liquidity and the january delisting of cyberguard s securities from the nasdaq stock market  safenet reserved the remaining balance  as of december  during  we agreed to accept a  note receivable from cyberguard as payment in full on cyberguard s obligation 
safenet received  on the note in the remaining balance of  was paid during the operating loss increased by or  to  in from  in the european operations had a  decrease in operating profit due to the reduction in sales of their products 
the domestic operations had a  decrease in its operating loss mainly due to increased sales of software licenses and chips to oem customers 
interest income declined from  in to  in due to lower interest rates and a decline in funds available for investment 
the income tax expense of  for the year ended december  was for taxes on the income of the european operations  which had an income tax liability of  in safenet did not record a united states income tax benefit in either year 
a valuation allowance for the full amount of the united states net deferred tax asset has been established since safenet s ability to use the united states net operating loss is dependent upon future taxable income 
safenet had a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  in the loss per common share basic and diluted was for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of per common share in liquidity and capital resources safenet believes that its current cash resources  together with the cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet its needs for the next year 
as of december   safenet had working capital of  including cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  in  cash and short term investments increased  the increase was mainly attributable to cash provided by operating activities of  cash provided by financing activities in included  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash used in investing activities during included investments in computer software development costs and equipment totaling  in  cash and cash equivalents increased  the increase was mainly attributable to proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock through a private placement in december  other cash provided by financing activities in included  from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash used in investing activities during included investments in computer software development costs and equipment totaling  and  respectively 
inflation and seasonality safenet does not believe that inflation will significantly impact its business 
we do not believe our business is seasonal  however  because we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment and software revenues upon establishing fair value of undelivered elements  recognition may be irregular and uneven  thereby disparately impacting quarterly operating results and balance sheet comparisons 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which the company is required to adopt effective january  because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  the adoption of the new statement will not have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk safenet s major market risk is to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  principally related to the swiss franc 
as of december   our investment in our european operations was approximately  a change in the average swiss franc exchange rate for the year ended december  would have changed our reported earnings for fiscal year by approximately  compared to  in a change in the december  swiss franc exchange rate would have changed safenet s reported currency translation adjustment for fiscal year by approximately  compared to  in a change in the average interest rate for fiscal year would have changed safenet s reported interest income by approximately at december  and  safenet did not have any interest bearing obligations 
in addition  safenet does not hold any derivative instruments and does not have any commodity market risk
