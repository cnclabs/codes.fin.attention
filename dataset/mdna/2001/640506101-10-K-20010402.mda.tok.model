item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a holding company whose principal asset is all of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of neon optica  inc in addition  under our agreements with consolidated edison communications  inc and exelon ventures corporation  which were consummated on september   neon communications  inc will be the holder of indefeasible rights of use in certain fiber optic filaments in the northeast and mid atlantic regions  as well as certain interconnections and telecommunications facilities in new york city and philadelphia  pennsylvania  in each case upon delivery of such assets by consolidated edison communications  inc and exelon ventures corporation pursuant to the terms of their respective agreements 
neon optica  inc is the wholly owned subsidiary of neon communications  inc and acts as the primary operating entity  generating revenue primarily through the leasing of capacity on our network 
the services neon optica provides include long term leases of dark fiber fiber optic transmission lines leased without optronics equipment installed by the company and shorter term leases of lit fiber fixed amounts of capacity on fiber optic transmission lines that use optronics equipment at fixed cost pricing over multi year terms 
neon optica also leases space at our facilities collocation services 
other service revenue includes nonrecurring design  engineering and construction services 
neon optica generally receives fixed monthly payments from its customers for the leasing of capacity on its network and recognizes revenues ratably over the term of the applicable customer agreement 
reorganizations we were incorporated in massachusetts in july under the name fivecom  inc in may  fivecom llc  an operating subsidiary majority owned by us  was organized in massachusetts 
also in may  fivecom llc and mode communications  inc  a subsidiary of northeast utilities  organized necom llc in massachusetts  with fivecom llc owning approximately  and mode owning approximately of the membership interests in necom llc 
in december  fivecom llc and mainecom services  a wholly owned subsidiary of central maine power  organized fivecom of maine llc in massachusetts  with mainecom owning  and fivecom llc owning  of the membership interests in fivecom of maine llc 
we were reorganized prior to our july initial public offering of million of senior notes due and million shares of our common stock at per share 
in april  prior to the reorganization  central maine power exercised its warrants to purchase  shares of membership interests in fivecom llc for an aggregate exercise price of and in july  a each of the minority members in fivecom llc and each of mode and mainecom exchanged their membership interests in fivecom llc  necom llc and fivecom of maine llc  respectively  for shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  b fivecom llc and necom llc were each merged with and into our wholly owned subsidiary  c fivecom of maine llc was merged into fivecom of maine  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and d we were reincorporated in delaware under the name neon communications  inc and our certificate of incorporation was amended and restated 
in december fivecom of maine was merged with and into neon communications  inc the shares of membership interest in fivecom llc received by central maine power upon exercise of its warrant were exchanged for  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  which shares had an estimated value at the time of the reorganization of approximately million 
mr 
colantonio  our president  and mr 
musen  a vice president  exchanged their membership interests in fivecom llc for  shares and  shares  respectively  of our series b convertible preferred stock  which shares had an estimated aggregate value at the time of the reorganization of approximately  and  respectively 
prior to the reorganization  which was completed on july   we held interests in our majority owned or controlled subsidiaries  fivecom llc  fivecom of maine llc and necom llc 
the interests of the minority owners of these subsidiaries are reflected on our balance sheet as minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of the reorganization  such minority owners became stockholders and the value of our stock received by them over the tangible book value of their minority interests was reflected as goodwill 
prior to our initial public offering of equity and debt  we were included in central maine power s consolidated federal income tax return pursuant to the terms of a tax sharing arrangement entered into in the benefit from income taxes represented refundable income taxes from central maine power as a result of this tax sharing arrangement 
we currently have no net operating loss carryforwards related to the period prior to our initial public offering as a result of this tax sharing arrangement 
in september  we entered into agreements with consolidated edison communications  inc cec and exelon ventures corporation exelon under which the company will receive an indefeasible right to use iru fiber optic facilities on the networks of cec and exelon to provide network transport and carrier services in their service areas  which include new york and philadelphia  as well as beyond their service areas to baltimore and washington  dc 
as part of these agreements  the company has issued  shares of common stock to cec and  shares of common stock to exelon  of which all but of this stock was restricted as of december   with such restrictions to lapse upon the completion of certain milestones over the terms of the agreements 
immediately preceding the closing of the agreements with cec and exelon  the company completed its second reorganization  under the terms of which neon communications  inc became the parent holding company of northeast optic network  inc at the same time  northeast optic network  inc changed its name to neon optica  inc 
the common stock of neon communications is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol nopt  with neon optica  inc  the operating entity  as its wholly owned subsidiary 
the names were changed to reflect the fact that neon is now doing business in both the northeast and the mid atlantic regions 
neon optica  inc continues to make periodic reports under the securities exchange act of in respect of its senior notes due in march  we signed a term sheet with exelon  pursuant to which exelon would purchase million in subordinated convertible notes from us  bearing interest at a rate of at least and due a provision in the term sheet provides for an additional payment from exelon of million on or before april in lieu of providing the irus  services and other cash proceeds required under the september agreements with exelon 
the term sheet also provides for the release of all restrictions on the common stock issued to exelon in september results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased by  or to  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  revenues in were generated by recurring lease services of  and other service revenue of  which consists of collocation revenues and nonrecurring revenues related to design  engineering  and construction 
the primary reason for the increase was the growth in demand for our lit services  revenues from which increased by  or to  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  lit services represented and  respectively  of recurring lease revenues during the years ended december  and collocation revenues grew by to  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to recognition of revenues 
we adopted sab no 
in the fourth quarter of under the guidance of sab no 
 we recognize revenues from nonrecurring installation charges and design  engineering and construction services ratably over the multi year network services terms to which the nonrecurring charges ultimately relate 
prior to the issuance of sab no 
 revenues for these nonrecurring services were generally recognized as services were performed because the company had no further obligations 
we are required to adopt this new accounting guidance as of january  in connection with the implementation of sab no 
 we have deferred approximately  and  of revenues and costs  respectively  during the year ended december   to be recognized ratably over the terms of the applicable network services agreements 
the results from operations in periods prior to the year ended december  have not been restated to reflect the impact of sab no 
instead  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the cumulative impact on these periods  totaling  has been recorded as a one time charge against operations in the year ended december  total cost of revenues for the year ended december  was  an increase of as compared to the  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional fiber optic facilities leases and increased network surveillance cost  operations and maintenance costs and property taxes resulting from network expansion in our service territory  which expanded from the northeast into the mid atlantic region during selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   reflecting increased investment in our sales and marketing and operations infrastructure  including personnel  advertising costs and promotional activities  as well as an increase in management and information technology 
our headcount increased by during the year  from employees as of december  to employees as of december  depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from increased capital expenditures related to the expansion of our communications network in our northeast and mid atlantic service areas  completion of additional network points of presence and the commencement of operations at our network operations center 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to lower cash and investment balances for the year compared to interest expense remained consistent from to  decreasing by less than one percent from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  interest expense primarily relates to our senior notes due for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in net loss is primarily attributable to the factors discussed above 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues increased by  or to  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  revenues in were generated by recurring lease services of  and other service revenue of  which consists of collocation revenues and nonrecurring revenues related to design  engineering  and construction 
the primary reason for the increase was the growth in demand for the our recurring lease services  which increased by from to lit services represented and  respectively  of recurring lease services during the years ended december  and total cost of revenues for the year ended december  was  an increase of as compared to the  in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to lease payments for fiber optic facilities  network surveillance cost  operations and maintenance costs and property taxes resulting from network expansion in our service territory 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   reflecting increased investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  including personnel  advertising costs and promotional activities and an increase in management and information technology 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher depreciation expense associated with additional segments of our system being placed in service and completion of our points of presence and the amortization of goodwill as a result of the reorganization on july  interest income increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to higher cash and investment balances for the entire year in compared to only five months of interest in resulting from the timing of the closing of our equity and debt public offerings in august interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from interest accrued on our senior notes due for the full year in as compared to only five months in the year for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of  compared to  before extraordinary item for the year ended december  the increase in net loss is primarily attributable to the factors discussed above 
the extraordinary item for the year ended december  amounted to  representing the write off of deferred financing costs associated with two construction loans repaid in the third quarter with the proceeds from our debt and equity public offerings 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have required substantial capital investment for the design  construction and development of our network and the purchase of telecommunications equipment 
capital expenditures were approximately million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to have substantial capital requirements in connection with i the expansion and improvement of our existing network  ii the design  construction and development of new networks  iii the connection of additional buildings and customers to our network  iv the purchase of additional telecommunication equipment  v the purchase and development of our operating support systems  and vi additional expenses required to operate and maintain existing facilities 
we have funded a substantial portion of these expenditures through our public offerings completed on august   which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting expenses and before deducting million in escrowed funds to cover the first seven semi annual interest payments on our senior notes due 
the substantial capital investment required to build our network has resulted in negative cash flow after investing activities over the last three years 
this negative cash flow after investing activities is a result of the requirement to build a substantial portion of our network before we can connect revenue generating customers 
we expect to continue to experience negative cash flow after investing activities for the current year due to the continuous expansion and development of our network 
our ability to continue this expansion will be limited by our current capital resources until sufficient cash flow after investing activities is generated unless we seek and obtain additional capital 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for neon communications was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was due primarily to additional fiber optic facilities leases and other costs of revenues resulting from network expansion in our service territory  which expanded from the northeast into the mid atlantic region during  as well as increased investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure  including personnel  advertising costs and promotional activities and an increase in administrative support 
net cash used in operating activities for neon optica was  reflecting the effect of a cash advance provided by the parent company for the build out of local points of presence pops and the related optronic equipment and for the cost of pop rental  pop operating expenses  optronic equipment maintenance and sales and marketing expenses  as contemplated in the arrangements with cec and exelon 
cash used in investing activities totaled   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
this decrease has been due to the uses of cash described above 
our uses of cash have consisted primarily of payment of the cost of construction and deployment of telecommunications equipment to build our communications network 
cash flow from financing activities was    and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flow from financing activities in was generated from the restricted cash placed in escrow in connection with the initial public offering of our senior notes due  cash received upon issuance of common stock to cec and exelon  and cash received upon the exercise of employee stock options 
cash flow from financing activities in was generated from the release of restricted cash placed in escrow in connection with the initial public offering of our senior notes due in   of the proceeds our public offerings in august were used to repay long term construction loans from central maine power and peoples heritage bank  and  of the proceeds was used to establish an escrow account to secure the payment of the first seven scheduled interest and principal payments on the notes  of which the first payment was made on february  we anticipate that we will continue to experience negative cash flow as we expand our network  construct networks  deploy telecommunications electronic equipment and market our services to an expanding customer base 
cash provided by operations will not be sufficient to fund the expansion and development of our system in the northeast and mid atlantic regions 
as a result  we intend to use our cash on hand and the remaining net proceeds of our public offerings  and will have to raise additional financing through some combination of commercial bank borrowings  leasing  vendor financing  strategic alliances and sale of equity or debt securities if we are to complete our expansion as currently planned 
as of february   we had approximately  in unrestricted cash on hand 
we have recently signed term sheets with northeast utilities and exelon  pursuant to which northeast utilities and exelon would purchase million and million  respectively  in subordinated convertible notes from us  bearing interest at a rate of at least and due the transactions with exelon and northeast utilities are each conditioned upon one or more holders of our common stock investing at least million and million  respectively  in new equity or in subordinated notes having substantially the same terms as the notes purchased by northeast utilities and exelon  respectively 
the closing of each of these transactions simultaneously would satisfy the condition to the closing of the other 
the transaction with exelon provides for an additional payment from exelon of million on or before april in lieu of providing the irus  services and other cash proceeds required under our agreements with exelon signed in september  as well as the release of all restrictions on the common stock issued to exelon in september each of these transactions is subject to other conditions  including the negotiation and execution of mutually agreeable definitive agreements 
separately  one of our major suppliers has informed us that they will not continue to sell equipment to us on normal credit terms 
we are currently negotiating with this supplier to obtain a deferral of amounts already owed to them 
if we are unable to obtain this deferral  we will pay the amounts owed to this supplier with the funds described above 
upon the close of the transactions with northeast utilities and exelon  after giving effect to a reduction in capital expenditures  we will have funds sufficient to finance our operations until at least the end of management believes these agreements will be consummated 
however  we cannot assure you that the transactions with northeast utilities and exelon will  in fact  be consummated 
if we fail to close these transactions and are unable to obtain alternative financing  we will be forced to suspend capital expenditures  downsize our operations and delay our network expansion and customer growth plans 
as a result  our rate of revenue growth could cease or slow materially and the fulfillment of our business plan and the date when we might achieve profitability may be substantially delayed 
our capital requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of our business plan and as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments or if demand for our services or cash flow from operations is less than or more than expected  our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  we make acquisitions  or we accelerate deployment of our network or otherwise alter the schedule or targets for the implementation of our business plan 
the expectations of required future capital expenditures are based on our current estimates 
risk factors there are a number of important factors that could affect the business and future operating results of neon communications and neon optica  including  without limitation  the factors set forth below  and the information contained in this quarterly report on form q should be read in light of such factors 
any of the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and our future operating results 
risk relating to our financial situation we have experienced significant net losses throughout our history  and are currently experiencing cash flow problems 
as a result  we will need additional financing in order to fund our operations and carry out our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain this financing  our business will be severely harmed and we may be required to seek protection from our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
we have incurred cumulative net losses since our inception of approximately million 
as of february   we had approximately  in unrestricted cash on hand 
we have recently signed term sheets with northeast utilities and exelon  pursuant to which northeast utilities and exelon would purchase million and million  respectively  in subordinated convertible notes from us  bearing interest at a rate of at least and due the transactions with exelon and northeast utilities are each conditioned upon one or more holders of our common stock investing at least million and million  respectively  in new equity or in subordinated notes having substantially the same terms as the notes purchased by northeast utilities and exelon  respectively 
the closing of each of these transactions simultaneously would satisfy the condition to the closing of the other 
the transaction with exelon provides for an additional payment from exelon of million on or before april in lieu of providing the irus  services and other cash proceeds required under our agreements with exelon signed in september  as well as the release of all restrictions on the common stock issued to exelon in september each of these transactions is subject to other conditions  including the negotiation and execution of mutually agreeable definitive agreements 
separately  one of our major suppliers has informed us that they will not continue to sell equipment to us on normal credit terms 
we are currently negotiating with this supplier to obtain a deferral of amounts already owed to them 
if we are unable to obtain this deferral  we will pay the amounts owed to this supplier with the funds described above 
upon the close of the transactions with northeast utilities and exelon  after giving effect to a reduction in capital expenditures  we will have funds sufficient to finance our operations until at least the end of management believes these agreements will be consummated 
however  we cannot assure you that the transactions with northeast utilities and exelon will  in fact  be consummated 
if we fail to close these transactions and are unable to obtain alternative financing  we will be forced to suspend capital expenditures  downsize our operations and delay our network expansion and customer growth plans 
as a result  our rate of revenue growth could cease or slow materially and the fulfillment of our business plan and the date when we might achieve profitability may be substantially delayed 
risks relating to our business strategy our business strategy depends upon anticipated customer demand for our services  and our failure to obtain customers for our services at profitable rates would adversely affect our business results 
our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to secure a market for our services and obtain service contracts with our communications customers 
many of our targeted customers may also be our potential competitors 
if our services are not satisfactory or cost competitive  our targeted customers may utilize other providers where available  or construct their own networks  which would reduce their need for our services and create future sources of competition for us 
if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon and are unable to obtain alternative financing  we will be forced to reduce our capital spending and will be unable to invest in expansion of our current network  which may impair our ability to attract new customers who require service or capacity we do not currently have 
intense competition in the telecommunications industry from a broad range of competitors may prevent us from obtaining customers and require us to lower prices 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from companies with significantly greater financial and other resources whose capacity is interchangeable with the capacity we offer  including incumbent local telephone companies  competitive local telephone companies and major long distance companies 
in addition  potential competitors capable of offering services similar to those offered by us include other communications service providers that own and operate their own networks and equipment  including cable television companies  electric utilities  microwave carriers  satellite carriers  wireless communication system operators and end users with private communications networks 
four of our principal stockholders  northeast utilities  new england business trust an affiliate of energy east corporation  consolidated edison communications  inc  and exelon ventures corporation each own or have rights  through one or more affiliates  to fibers in the cable that includes a portion of our network  which permits each of them to compete directly with us in the future if they use these fibers for purposes other than their corporate requirements 
our rights of way are non exclusive so that other service providers including the utilities themselves could install competing networks using the same rights of way 
because we offer a relatively narrow range of services in comparison to some of our competitors  we cannot achieve revenues comparable to companies offering a broader array of services and may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to the services we offer 
unlike more diversified telecommunications companies  we derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues from the leasing of fiber optic capacity on a wholesale basis to our customers  most of whom are telecommunications companies and internet service providers serving end users 
the limited nature of our current services could limit our potential revenues and result in our having lower revenues than competitors which provide a wider array of services 
due to rapidly evolving technologies in our industry and the uncertainty of future government regulation  our current business plan may become obsolete and we may be unable to maintain a competitive position if we are unable to successfully adjust our products  services and business strategies as required 
in the future  we may become subject to more intense competition due to the development of new technologies  an increased supply of domestic and international transmission capacity  the consolidation in the industry among local and long distance service providers and the effects of deregulation resulting from the telecommunications act of the introduction of new services and products or the emergence of new technologies may change the cost or increase the supply of services and products similar to those which we provide 
we cannot predict which of many possible future product and service offerings will be crucial to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop profitably and provide such products and services 
prices for our services to carriers specifically  and interstate services in general  may decline over the next several years due primarily to price competition to the extent that network providers continue to install networks that compete with our network 
we also believe that there will be technological advances that will permit substantial increases in the transmission capacity of both new and existing fiber 
a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
historically  a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  three customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
in  two customers accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues of a small number of customers 
risks relating to the expansion and operation of our fiber optic network the successful  timely and cost effective expansion of our fiber optic network within the northeast and into the mid atlantic region is crucial to our business plan  and depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
our ability to achieve our strategic objectives depends in large part upon the successful  timely and cost effective expansion of our fiber optic network within the northeast and into the mid atlantic region 
in addition to the financial constraints under which we will be operating if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon or obtain alternative financing  among the major factors that could affect our success are any delay or difficulty experienced by consolidated edison communications or exelon ventures corporation in the performance of their obligations under our agreements with them  and the failure of both affiliated and third party suppliers or contractors to meet their obligations to construct and maintain significant portions of our fiber optic network in a timely and cost effective manner 
either of these factors  or other factors  over which we have little control  could significantly hinder our ability to complete our network and execute our business plan 
if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon  the expenditures necessary to sufficiently expand our fiber optic network and develop our services in order to satisfy the current and forecasted demands of our customers will surpass our available cash  and we may be unable to obtain additional capital to develop our services on a timely basis and on acceptable terms 
although we have expended significant resources in building our network and the development of our customer base  we will require significant additional cash in order to expand our geographic coverage and the range of services which we can offer throughout our service area in order to be competitive in our market 
if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon or obtain other sufficient financing to resume our planned expansion and related capital expenditures  these expenditures for expansion and for more services  together with associated operating expenses  will reduce our cash flow and profitability until we establish an adequate customer base throughout all of our coverage areas 
to date  we have expended substantial amounts on construction of our network from the proceeds of our financing activities and  accordingly  we have generated negative cash flow 
if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon  we will need to obtain additional capital to carry out our planned expansion of our services  to increase our service territory  and to fund our operations  and we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that we can obtain it on a timely basis and on acceptable terms 
we obtain some of the key components used in our fiber optic network from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could disrupt our operations and result in a substantial loss of revenues 
we depend upon a small group of suppliers for some of the key components and parts used in our network 
in particular  we purchase cable from lucent fitel and from corning  and we purchase fiber optic equipment from nortel networks  cisco systems and sycamore networks 
any delay or extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components  changes in the pricing arrangements with our suppliers and manufacturers or delay in transitioning a replacement supplier s product into our network could disrupt our operations 
one of our suppliers has placed a credit hold on us  making it more difficult to obtain equipment from that supplier and  if we are unable to close our proposed financing transactions with northeast utilities and exelon or obtain alternative financing  other suppliers may do the same 
our fiber optic network  which is our sole source of revenue  is vulnerable to physical damage  catastrophic outages  power loss and other disruptions beyond our control  and the occurrence of any of these failures could result in immediate loss of revenues  payment of outage credits to our customers and  more importantly  the loss of our customers confidence and our business reputation 
our success in marketing our services to our customers requires that we provide high reliability  high bandwidth and a secure network 
our network and the infrastructure upon which it depends are subject to physical damage  power loss  capacity limitations  software defects  breaches of security and other disruptions beyond our control that may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers 
our agreements with our customers typically provide for the payment of outage related credits a predetermined reduction or offset against our lease rate when a customer s leased facility is non operational or otherwise does not meet certain operating parameters or damages in the event of a disruption in service 
these credits or damages could be substantial and could significantly decrease our net revenues 
significant or lengthy outages would also undermine our customers confidence in our fiber optic network and injure our business reputation 
risks relating to our rights of way we could lose the contract rights upon which we rely to operate and maintain our network in the event of bankruptcy proceedings relating to one or more of the third parties that have granted to us the right to build and operate our network using their rights of way 
the construction and operation of significant portions of our fiber optic network depend upon contract rights known as indefeasible rights of use 
indefeasible rights of use are commonly used in the telecommunications industry  but remain a relatively new concept in property law 
although indefeasible rights of use give the holder a number of rights to control the relevant rights of way or fiber optic filaments  legal title remains with the grantor of the rights 
therefore  the legal status of indefeasible rights of use remains uncertain  and our indefeasible rights of use might be voidable in the event of bankruptcy of the grantor 
if we were to lose an indefeasible right of use in a key portion of our network  our ability to service our customers could become seriously impaired and we could be required to incur significant expense to resume the operation of our fiber optic network in the affected areas 
despite our existing rights of way  we may be forced to make substantial additional payments to the affected landowners or remove our network from their property  which would significantly harm our business and our results of operations 
our indefeasible rights of use depend on the grantor s interest in the property on which our network is located 
to the extent that a grantor of an indefeasible right of use has a limited easement in the underlying property and not full legal title  the adequacy of our indefeasible rights of use could be challenged in court 
for example  in may  at t entered into a costly settlement of a class action suit brought by landowners who asserted that the railroad based rights of way upon which at t had relied to build portions of its fiber optic network were insufficient to permit at t to use these rights of way for telecommunications purposes 
we believe that it is likely that a number of landowners may make similar claims against us based on our use of utility rights of way for our telecommunications purposes 
in fact  some landowners have already asserted claims against us on this basis  and  to date  in two cases  rather than electing to contest the landowners interpretation of the scope of the easement  we have made a payment to such landowners to acquire rights of way meeting our requirements 
we believe that the easements granted by a substantial number of landowners to grantors of our indefeasible rights of use are similar in scope to those with respect to which claims have been asserted  and we cannot guarantee that additional claims will not be made in the future 
because significant portions of our fiber optic network are constructed upon rights of way controlled by electric utility companies which generally place the operation of their electrical facilities ahead of the operation of our fiber optic network  we may be unable to construct and operate our fiber optic network in the affected areas without periodic interruptions and delays caused by the day to day operations of these utility companies 
our rights of way agreements with northeast utilities  central maine power company a subsidiary of energy east corporation  consolidated edison communications  inc  and exelon ventures corporation contain provisions which acknowledge the right of these companies to make the provision of electrical services to their own customers their top priority 
these companies are required only to exercise reasonable care with respect to our facilities and are otherwise free to take whatever actions they deem appropriate with respect to ensuring or restoring service to their electricity customers  any of which actions could impair operation of our network 
in addition  some of our ongoing operational efforts are constrained by the limited ability of the utilities to de energize segments of their transmission and distribution facilities in order to permit construction crews to work safely 
we have experienced construction delays in the past as a result of such inability to timely de energize certain segments and we may experience such delays in the future 
risks relating to government regulation federal regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly and we could become subject to unfavorable new rules and requirements which could impose substantial financial and administrative burdens on us and interfere with our ability to successfully execute our business strategies 
regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly 
existing and future federal  state  and local governmental regulations will greatly influence our viability 
consequently  undesirable regulatory changes could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenues from telecommunications provided to end users  which represent a portion of our revenues  are subject to contributions to the fcc s universal service fund 
while we generally do not deal directly with end users of telecommunications and are therefore generally exempt from contributing to the fcc s universal service fund  the fcc treats certain internet service providers purchasing telecommunications as end users 
our revenues from providing telecommunications to end users  which represent a portion of our revenues  are therefore subject to an assessment of of gross interstate revenues for the fourth quarter of and at for the first quarter of such assessments vary and may increase from quarter to quarter 
if the annual contribution amount would be less than  we would qualify for a de minimus exemption from contribution to the fund 
if we become subject to regulation as a common carrier in the future  we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements 
we do not believe that we are currently a common carrier  but that status could change based on differing interpretations of current regulations  regulatory changes and changes in the way we conduct our business 
if we become regulated as a common carrier  we would have to file tariffs for our services with the fcc and submit other reports  and would be required to contribute to federal funds including  but not limited to  those established for telecommunications relay services  for the management of the north american numbering plan and for local number portability 
these regulatory requirements could impose substantial burdens on us 
the communications act of requires incumbent local telephone companies to provide elements of their networks to competitors on an unbundled basis 
in a recent decision  the fcc determined that dark fiber is a network element that incumbent local telephone companies must provide to others 
the availability of this alternative source of supply may increase competition among providers of dark fiber services and could decrease the demand for our dark fiber 
regulatory changes could affect relationships between us  our competitors and customers in unforeseeable ways that could reduce our business opportunities 
our relationships with the telecommunications companies with whom we deal are all affected by our respective positions in the fcc s regulatory scheme 
accordingly  changes in federal telecommunications law may affect our business by virtue of the interrelationships that exist among us and many of these regulated telecommunications entities 
it is difficult for us to forecast at this time how these changes will affect us in light of the complex interrelationships that exist in the industry and the different levels of regulation 
state regulation of companies providing telecommunications services varies substantially from state to state and we may become subject to burdensome and restrictive state regulations as we expand our fiber optic network into a broader geographic area  which could interfere with our operations and our ability to meet our strategic objectives 
we may be subject to state regulation  which can vary substantially from state to state 
neon optica s subsidiaries in new york and connecticut have obtained authority to provide intrastate telecommunications services on a competitive common carrier basis 
therefore  these subsidiaries are subject to the obligations that applicable law places on all similarly certificated common carriers including the filing of tariffs  state regulation of certain service offerings  pricing  payment of regulatory fees and reporting requirements 
the costs of compliance with these regulatory obligations  or any of the regulatory requirements of other states to which we might become subject  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
moreover  some of our rights of way depend on our status as a common carrier in these states  and if that status were to be successfully challenged  those rights of way could be terminated 
municipal regulation of our access to public rights of way is subject to change and could impose administrative burdens that would adversely affect our business 
local governments typically retain the ability to license public rights of way  subject to the federal requirement that local governments may not prohibit the provision of telecommunications services 
changes in local government regulation could impose additional costs on our business and limit our operations 
local authorities affect the timing and costs associated with our use of public rights of way 
risks relating to our capitalization because we have a large amount of debt  we will be required to devote a significant portion of our cash flow to pay interest and we may not have sufficient remaining cash flow to meet our other obligations and execute our business strategies 
we are highly leveraged 
our high degree of debt  including neon optica s million senior notes due  could have adverse consequences to the holders of neon communication s equity securities 
commencing on august   a substantial portion of our cash flow will be dedicated to the payment of the  per annum of interest expense associated with our debt and such cash flow may be insufficient to meet our payment obligations on our debt in addition to paying our other obligations as they become due 
in addition  due to our leverage ratio  our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for completion of our network or other purposes may be impaired 
also  certain of our future borrowings may be at variable rates of interest that could cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
because we are highly leveraged  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors and may be especially vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally  or to delays in or increases in the costs of operating and constructing our network 
in connection with neon optica s substantial public debt  neon optica has agreed to significant restrictions on its operations that limit our ability to enter into major corporate transactions  and as a result we may be unable to pursue potential corporate opportunities which would benefit neon communications and its stockholders 
the indenture under which neon optica s debt was issued imposes significant operating and financing restrictions on us and our present and future subsidiaries 
these restrictions affect  and in certain cases significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  create liens  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  guarantee indebtedness  sell assets or consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
these limitations could prevent us from exploiting corporate opportunities as they arise  which could be detrimental to the interests of our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  but do not believe that this exposure is material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of corporate debt securities and us government agency discount notes with an average maturity of less than six months 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels that existed at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
because we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected
