item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the metals service center industry was again faced with a difficult operating environment during  especially in the second half of the year 
however  the company experienced record sales and earnings results  primarily due to the inclusion of the sales and earnings from the companies acquired by reliance in and  and due to the company s customer and product diversity as well as effective sales and gross profit management 
pricing for most of the company s products increased slightly  early in  but then fell steadily throughout the remainder of beginning in the second half of  many of the company s peers were significantly impacted by the general economic downturn occurring in the united states 
although the company was impacted by the general downturn in certain product lines and geographic areas  our customer  product and geographic diversity allowed us to achieve record financial results for sales to the semiconductor  electronics and related industries were strong during  and sales to the aerospace industry improved during the fourth quarter of the improvements in these industries during offset declines in the rail car and truck trailer markets experienced during sales of basic carbon steel products also declined in the second half of  primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
the company believes its results have been less volatile to the economic trends affecting the industry because its operations are geographically diversified  it has a wide range of products  and its customer base and the industries to which it sells are highly diversified 
reliance s diversification and financial performance have benefited from several significant acquisitions during the reported periods

management believes that the company is positioned to take full advantage of improved economic environments  while at the same time it is poised to operate efficiently in less favorable economies because of its tight cost controls  high inventory turnover and diversification 
management does not anticipate the same level of gross margin and net income returns in as in recent years due to the current general economic conditions and volatility of metal costs  net of the impact of any acquisitions which may be made during recent developments the company completed four acquisitions and a strategic asset purchase during  and has completed two acquisitions and a strategic asset purchase in through these acquisitions  the company entered two new geographic markets  expanded its presence in the midwest and southeast markets of the united states and gained new customers in the oil and gas sector

results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales    gross profit    s  g a expenses    depreciation expense    income from operations    year ended december  compared to year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share amounts consolidated net sales were a record  or an increase of  for the year compared to  which reflects an increase in tons sold of and an increase in the average selling price per ton of 
the increase in tons sold during was primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of sales from the acquisitions along with sales from the acquisitions  as follows liebovich  acquired march   allegheny steel distributors  inc allegheny  acquired september   arrow metals  acquired october   hagerty  acquired february   toma  acquired june   united  acquired august   and east tennessee  acquired december  collectively  the acquisitions 
tons sold in experienced shifts in product mix  as compared to  due to increased sales to the semiconductor  electronics and related industries throughout and increased sales to the aerospace industry during the fourth quarter of however  due to the general economic slowing during the second half of  the company experienced a decline in sales volume in certain of its markets  primarily for carbon steel products in the southeast and midwest regions of the united states 
this shift in product mix resulted in a increase in the average selling price in as compared to the stainless steel  aluminum and titanium products sold to the semiconductor  electronics and aerospace industries are among the highest priced products sold by the company 
same store sales excludes sales of the acquisitions increased  or  with year tons sold remaining flat as compared to  and the average selling price per ton increasing by 
the increase in the average selling price is due to the shift in product mix with increased sales of the highest priced products discussed above 
total gross profit increased  to  in  compared to  in  mainly due to the additional gross profit generated by the acquisitions 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit remained fairly consistent at in compared to in although gross profit percentages declined somewhat in for sales of most carbon steel products due to reduced costs and a more competitive environment resulting from the slowing of the economy  the shift in product mix offset these declines 
a greater portion of the company s sales were to the semiconductor  electronics and aerospace markets that typically produce higher gross margins than other products sold by the company  and the gross profit percentages achieved on sales of these products increased in as compared to further  certain of the acquisitions typically operate at higher gross margin percentages than the company has historically operated at on a consolidated basis  contributing to the company s ability to substantially maintain its record gross margin percentage in the period 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased  or  from  consistent with the increase in sales 
these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense increased for compared to  due to the inclusion of both the depreciation expense and the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisitions  along with depreciation expense on current year capital expenditures 
income from operations  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  remained fairly consistent as a percentage of sales at in and in the slight decline is consistent with the change in gross profit percentages for the periods

the increase in sales volume during was primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of sales from the acquisitions along with sales from the acquisitions  as follows phoenix corporation phoenix metals  acquired january   durrett sheppard steel co  inc durrett  acquired january   chatham steel corporation chatham  acquired july   lusk metals  acquired september   american metals corporation american metals  acquired october   steel bar corporation steel bar  acquired october   engbar pipe steel co 
engbar  acquired october   liebovich  acquired march   allegheny  acquired september   and arrow metals  acquired october  collectively  the acquisitions 
the increased sales volume was somewhat offset due to a decrease of approximately in tons sold to the aerospace market during the average selling price for decreased from the average selling price due to lower costs of material for most of the company s products  and a shift in product mix 
as most of the companies acquired during and sell primarily carbon steel products  which generally have a lower selling price than other products sold by the company  the shift in product mix has contributed to lower average selling prices 
reduced aerospace sales volume also contributed to the lower average selling price  as the heat treated aluminum products sold to the aerospace industry are among the most high priced products sold by the company 
further  prices of heat treated aluminum products decreased during  which also lowered the average selling price 
excluding sales of the acquisitions  sales declined  primarily due to lower selling prices and changes in product mix 
the lower sales amount includes a increase in tons sold  which is primarily due to general economic improvements  especially in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the average selling price decreased by in as compared to  primarily due to reduced selling prices of most of the company s products  a greater shift toward carbon steel products  and reduced sales to the aerospace market in the company recorded a one time net gain of  from a life insurance policy  which was not taxable to the company  in connection with the company s supplemental executive retirement plan serp during the life insurance proceeds related to the death of one of the company s executive officers in january and are net of the amount to be paid to his beneficiary under the terms of the serp 
total gross profit increased to  in  compared to  in  an increase of  due mainly to the additional gross profit generated by the acquisitions 
expressed as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to for  compared to in this increase was primarily due to costs of raw materials declining at a more rapid rate than selling prices for most of the company s products during most of also  in the latter half of  when price increases for many of the company s materials were announced  the company s sales force was able to increase selling prices to its customers in advance of the increased costs taking effect 
this allowed the company to expand its gross margin percentage during this period of changing prices 
in addition  certain of the acquisitions typically operate at higher gross margin percentages than the company has historically operated at on a consolidated basis 
this positively contributed to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the period 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  for due to the increased sales volume primarily from the acquisitions 
these expenses represented and of sales in and  respectively 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the lower selling prices experienced during  and due to certain of the acquisitions typically operating at higher expense levels than those historically experienced by the company on a consolidated basis 
these acquired companies also operate at higher gross margin levels  as discussed above 
excluding the acquisitions  these expenses decreased by  in compared to  on an increased sales volume of which illustrates the impact of lower selling prices on these expenses expressed as a percentage of sales 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  for compared to the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of both the depreciation expense and the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisitions 
income from operations increased to  in from  in the increase was mainly attributable to increased gross profit margins and the inclusion of operating income from the acquisitions 
interest expense increased by in compared to due to an increase in the average debt outstanding to fund primarily acquisitions made in the second half of this increased the beginning debt outstanding  which was then reduced slightly during the year 
the effective income tax rate of the company decreased from in to in  mainly due to the company s receipt of tax free life insurance proceeds during the effect of this benefit was somewhat offset by increased non deductible amortization of goodwill for certain of the acquisitions 
included in pretax income for is a one time net gain of  from life insurance proceeds discussed above 
this resulted in net income of 
per diluted share in the period 
liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands other than share and per share amounts at december   working capital was  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to the additional working capital of the acquisitions  along with increased inventory and accounts receivable balances to support the company s increased sales levels 
cash flow from operations decreased in as compared to mainly due to the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels increasing by  and  respectively  and its accounts payable level decreasing by  excluding the addition of working capital from companies acquired in these changes occurred primarily to support the increased sales activity of the company  resulting from a greater concentration of higher priced products and higher average selling prices at december  compared to december  the company s inventory turnover rate has remained at just under five times  consistent with the accounts receivable days sales outstanding rate has increased somewhat at december   primarily due to increased sales to customer markets that typically receive longer payment terms than most other customer markets served by the company 
the company s capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and material handling and processing equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and the company s revolving line of credit 
the syndicated credit facility has a borrowing limit of  and the company may use up to  of the line of credit to make acquisitions 
as of december    was outstanding under this credit facility 
the company has recently engaged bank of america  lead agent under the syndicated facility  to refinance this line with an increased borrowing limit to support the company s future financing requirements 
the company also has an agreement that allows the company to issue and have outstanding letters of credit in an amount not to exceed  in october  this agreement was amended to provide an additional credit facility in the form of a cash advance with a limit of  to provide sufficient liquidity for the acquisitions pending in the fourth quarter of  and the significant stock repurchase made in the fourth quarter of discussed below 
this additional facility was implemented as a bridge to allow the company to meet its short term objectives  until the refinancing of the syndicated credit facility is completed 
as of december    was outstanding under this facility  which expires april  the company refinanced the borrowings under this facility on february   with borrowings from its syndicated credit line 
the company has agreements with insurance companies for private placements of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of  the senior notes that were issued in the private placements have maturity dates ranging from to  with an average life of years  and bear interest at an average fixed rate of per annum 
the company s sources of liquidity  as discussed above  were sufficient for operations and to fund the acquisitions and stock repurchases 
the purchase price of the acquisitions made in totaled approximately  see recent developments section for a complete discussion of the acquisitions made in the company repurchased  of its common stock during  including a single private transaction for  net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were  for the year 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company anticipates that the funds generated from operations and funds from its restructured line of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital and acquisition needs for the foreseeable future 
the purchases of viking and a s were funded with borrowings on the company s line of credit 
on august   the board of directors of the company approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of the company s outstanding common stock through its stock repurchase plan  for a total of  shares 
since inception of the stock repurchase plan  the company has purchased a total of  shares of its common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
in  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of per share 
the company did not repurchase any shares during the company believes such purchases enhance shareholder value and reflect its confidence in the long term growth potential of the company 
inflation the company s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  the company has been successful in adjusting prices to its customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality the company recognizes that some of its customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of the company s geographic  product and customer diversity  however  the company s operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of the company s products and holiday closures for some of its customers 
there can be no assurance that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to  at december   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the amortization of goodwill in the year was  or approximately of pretax income 
the company s estimate of the useful life of goodwill of years is considered appropriate due to the long term nature of the business  including its customers  supply sources and longevity of operations 
the risk associated with the carrying value of goodwill is whether future operating income before amortization of goodwill will be sufficient on an undiscounted basis to recover the carrying value 
the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
the measurement of possible impairment is based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if an impairment exists  the amount of such impairment would be calculated based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
in management s opinion  the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and no impairment exists at december  however  any significant change in the useful lives of goodwill  as estimated by management  or any changes to accounting for goodwill as new accounting standards are issued in the future  could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition
