since  we have significantly increased our sales and marketing  service and support  research and development and general and administrative staff 
although our revenues have significantly increased over the last three years  we experienced fluctuating operating margins during  and primarily as a result of increases in staff levels  expansion of operations outside of the united states  and our increased investment in strategy 
com 
our net losses increased substantially during  as our growth in revenues  and particularly higher margin product license revenues  decreased  while our expenses have significantly increased due primarily to aggressive hiring of additional personnel and advertising expenditures in the first half of  increased investment in our strategy 
com subsidiary  and increased legal and professional fees relating to class action lawsuits and an sec investigation in connection with matters relating to the restatement of our  and financial statements 
our net loss increased significantly during to million primarily as a result of the following factors operating expenses excluding in process research and development and restructuring related charges increased by million while gross profit increased by only million  amortization of intangible assets increased by million  we recorded an million expense associated with an agreement to settle outstanding class action and derivative shareholder lawsuit litigation of which approximately million is a cash charge for legal fees and administration costs and approximately million is a non cash charge  we recorded a million charge related to restructuring activities  and we recorded a million loss on investments  net of realized gain of million 
our revenues historically have been derived from two principal sources  fees for product licenses and fees for product support and other services  including maintenance  education and consulting services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and particularly with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as applicable 
product license revenues are generally recognized upon persuasive evidence of an arrangement as provided by agreements or contracts executed by both parties  delivery of the software and determination that collection of a fixed or determinable license fee is reasonably assured 
when fees for software upgrades and enhancements  maintenance  consulting or education are bundled with the license fee  they are unbundled using objective evidence of the fair value of the multiple elements represented by our customary pricing for each element in separate transactions 
if such evidence of fair value exists on undelivered elements and there is no such evidence of fair value established for delivered elements  revenue is first allocated to the elements where such evidence of fair value has been established and the residual amount is allocated to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist for undelivered elements or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered  subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in sop technical support revenues are derived from customer support agreements generally entered into in connection with initial product license sales and subsequent renewals 
fees for our technical support services are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support agreement  which is typically one year 
we also record as deferred revenue the fair value of implicit maintenance arrangements when resellers or other customers that sell our software to end users offer these end users the right to receive the then current version of our software at the time of resale 
these agreements may extend over several years 
fees for our education and consulting services are typically recognized at the time the services are performed 
revenue from arrangements where we provide hosting services is recognized over the hosting period 
any fees paid or costs incurred prior to the hosting period  such as license fees  consulting  customization or development services  are deferred and recognized ratably over the subsequent hosting period  which is typically two to three years 
customers at times require consulting and implementation services  which may include evaluating their business needs  identifying resources necessary to meet their needs and installing the solution to fulfill their needs 
when the software license arrangement requires us to provide significant consulting services to produce  customize or modify software  or when the customer considers these services essential to the functionality of the software product  both the product license revenue and product support and other services revenue are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop we recognize revenue from these arrangements using contract accounting typically  the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs and  therefore  both product license and product support and other services revenue are recognized as work progresses 
expected losses on contracts in progress are expensed in the current period 
as of december   we have not incurred any losses on contracts in progress 
if the arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can demonstrate that the software or services can meet the acceptance criteria 
if the software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to sell our products and services to customers for large scale applications and have continued to enter into similar transactions 
in contrast to earlier periods in which our typical customer transaction involved a stand alone software license and simple maintenance and support services  these transactions typically involve multiple software products and services for use by very large numbers of end users across network  intranet  web  wireless and voice communication channels  and sometimes incorporate elements from our strategy 
com network 
in addition  these multiple element transactions often include significant implementation and other consulting work and may also include the provision of hosting services  in which we manage the operation of hosting the customer s specific e commerce application 
customers often use our products and services in a variety of ways  including internal use  integration with their own products for resale to end users and creation of e commerce applications 
these arrangements typically lead to revenue recognition from multiple elements  including product license fees  product support fees and royalties based on advertising  e commerce transactions or the resale of solutions that incorporate our software platform 
these large  multiple element transactions typically involve more complex licensing and product support arrangements than the software licensing and maintenance and support arrangements that comprised the bulk of our revenues in earlier periods 
based on the revenue recognition criteria established in sop and sop  revenue from many of these large  multiple element contracts may not be recognized upon full execution and delivery of the software product as in the past  but instead is initially recorded as deferred revenue  with product revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs or ratably over the entire term of the contract 
if the arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can demonstrate that the software or services can meet the acceptance criteria 
as a result of the size and complexity of these transactions  our results for any quarter may depend significantly on the types of customer transactions that we enter into during the quarter and on the mix of product licenses  support agreements  implementation work and other specific terms of each transaction  each of which may have a significant effect on the manner in which we recognize revenue from the transaction 
the sales cycle for our products may span nine months or more 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of a quarter 
even minor delays in booking orders may have a significant adverse impact on revenues for a particular quarter 
to the extent that delays are incurred in connection with orders of significant size  the impact will be correspondingly greater 
product license revenues in any quarter can be dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result of these and other factors  our quarterly results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
we license our software through license transactions generated by our direct sales force and increasingly through or in conjunction with channel partners  including value added resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we intend to increase the level of indirect sales activities 
however  our efforts to continue to expand indirect sales may not be successful 
we also intend to continue to expand our international operations and have committed  and continue to commit  significant management time and financial resources to developing direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
we recently implemented a new multi channel distribution strategy and product pricing plan designed to expand our customer base  improve operating efficiency and decrease the length of sales cycles 
the strategy includes the use of the web as a channel for distributing products where new and existing customers can test our software on a demonstration basis and configure  upgrade and order software directly online via a standard pricing model 
in addition  we will now provide complimentary evaluation software for all potential customers and qualified partners 
recognizing the need to bring operating expenses in line with our revenue expectations  during the third quarter of  we developed and implemented a restructuring plan that called for the elimination of employees or approximately of our workforce 
we also rescinded approximately offers of employment  reduced various company sponsored events for employees  limited the use of external contractors and consultants and developed a plan to consolidate facilities 
to implement these actions we made severance payments to employees  incurred costs for rescinded job offers  recognized expenses associated with stock grants from a principal shareholder and the acceleration of vesting provisions of stock options and recorded a liability for commitments related to company sponsored events 
these costs totaled million and are reflected as restructuring and related charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we expect that annualized savings from these actions will approximate million and will contribute to slowing the growth of our sales and marketing expenses and our general and administrative expenses 
substantially all restructuring costs and related charges had been paid as of december  the unpaid amount of  is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our operations and prospects have been and will be significantly affected by the developments relating to the revision of our  and financial statements 
we and certain of our officers and directors are defendants in a class action lawsuit alleging violations of various securities laws and certain of our officers and directors are defendants in a shareholder derivative lawsuit alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties related to our restated financial statements 
in october  we entered into agreements to settle the class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
both settlements are subject to confirmatory discovery  final documentation  court approval and certain other conditions

total revenues consist of revenues derived from sales of product licenses and product support and other services  including technical support  education and consulting services 
total revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in  resulting in annual revenue growth rates of in  in and in total revenues may not continue to increase at the rates experienced in prior periods 
additionally  based on the revenue recognition criteria established in sop and sop  revenue from many large  multiple element arrangements is recorded as deferred revenue  with both product license revenues and product support and other services revenues recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost inputs as the work progresses 
if the arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria 
if the software license arrangement obligates us to the delivery of unspecified future products  then revenue is recognized on the subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
in  we launched the strategy 
com finance channel 
in  we launched the strategy 
com news and weather channels  and in march  we launched the strategy 
com sports and traffic channels 
we did not recognize revenues related to strategy 
com until  in which we recognized million in network affiliate and subscription fees and other services 
during  approximately million of strategy 
com revenues related to a customer from whom we do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue in the future 
we expect to continue to generate revenues from oem fees  network affiliation fees  subscription fees  hosting  transaction and other fees from strategy 
com services in the future 
during  we agreed to restructure our relationship with a significant customer  terminating the strategy 
com affiliation and joint research and development agreement and replacing it with a standard enterprise software license and maintenance agreement 
while we had been providing services to the customer throughout the year  no revenue had been recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policies 
in view of changes in the customer s internal information technology plans  we entered into an agreement with the customer in which we agreed to discontinue our development efforts and deliver all existing work product 
since we have no future obligations to this customer  all payments were made prior to the end of the year  and all other revenue recognition criteria were met  we recorded revenues of million  with million and million recorded as product license and services revenue  respectively  and deferred an additional million related to ongoing technical support obligations 
of the total million recorded as services revenue  million related to strategy 
com 
we do not expect to generate significant recurring revenue from this customer in future periods 
product license revenues 
product license revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in  resulting in annual growth rates of in  in and in the increase in product license revenues was due to increased customer acceptance of our recently released products and the growth of the business intelligence software market in general 
product license revenues were also positively affected by the restructuring of the customer relationship described above which resulted in million of product license revenue 
although product revenues have increased each year  the rate of increase has declined 
we believe this may be caused  in part  by concerns of potential new customers over our restatement of financial results and the related litigation during we believe the resolution of these matters may relieve these concerns 
we expect product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate on a period to period basis and vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
additionally  historic growth rates my not be sustainable or may decline due to the current economic climate in the first quarter of with respect to decreased corporate spending in information technology 
product support and other services revenues 
product support and other services revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in  resulting in a growth rate of in  in and in the increase in product support and other services revenues was primarily due to a continuing increase in large scale business intelligence applications which require significant implementation and other consulting work 
as a result of expected fluctuations in product license revenues discussed above  we expect product support and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues to fluctuate on a period to period basis and vary significantly from the percentage of total revenues achieved in prior years 
international revenues 
international revenues are included in the amounts discussed above and are discussed separately in this paragraph 
international revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in  resulting in a growth rate of in  in and in growth in international product license revenues accounted for of the total product license growth during the increase in these revenues is due to the expansion of our international operations  new product offerings and growing international market acceptance of our software products 
international revenues also increased as a result of the recognition of million of product license revenues from the non recurring transaction with the significant customer that restructured its relationship with us 
in addition  we opened new sales offices in argentina  switzerland  mexico  korea and australia in  in brazil in  in canada and italy in and in austria  france  the netherlands  germany  united kingdom and spain prior to as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues were in  in and in we anticipate that international revenues will continue to account for a significant amount of total revenues and management expects to continue to commit significant time and financial resources to the maintenance and ongoing development of direct and indirect international sales and support channels 
costs and expenses cost of product license revenues 
cost of product license revenues consists primarily of the costs of product manuals  media  amortization of capitalized software expenses and royalties paid to third party software vendors 
cost of product license revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in as a percentage of product license revenues  however  cost of product license revenues decreased from in  to in and to in the decrease in cost of product license revenues as a percentage of product license revenues was due to economies of scale realized by producing larger volumes of product materials and decreased materials and shipping costs due to an increase in the percentage of customers reproducing product documentation at their sites 
we anticipate that the cost of product license revenues may increase as product license revenues increase 
in the event that we enter into additional royalty arrangements in the future  cost of product license revenues as a percentage of total product license revenues may increase 
cost of product support and other services 
cost of product support and other services consists of the costs of providing consulting services to customers and partners  technical support and education 
cost of product support and other services revenues increased from million in to million in  and to million in as a percentage of product support and other services revenues  cost of product support and other services revenues was in  in and in the increase in cost of product support and other services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of personnel providing consulting  education and technical support to customers as a result of new product licenses sold associated with a continuing increase in large scale business intelligence applications and complex strategy 
com deployments 
the total cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues increased slightly in compared to due to the increased use of third parties to perform consulting services 
the significant increase in total cost of product support and other services revenues as a percentage of product support and other services revenues services margin in compared to was primarily attributable to the following a substantial increase in the use of third parties to perform consulting services  an increase in consulting services revenues as a percentage of total product support and other services revenues  which are at lower margins than other product support revenues  the agreement to restructure a large customer relationship which resulted in recognizing a significant amount of services revenue at no margin  excess capacity in consulting personnel  and excess capacity in the strategy 
com service infrastructure 
we have increased our consulting  education and technical support staffing levels based on anticipated increases in revenues 
to the extent our product support and other services revenues do not increase at anticipated rates  our services margin may not improve without lowering costs of product support and other services 
to the extent that strategy 
com can maximize economies of scale and leverage off its relationship with microstrategy and existing infrastructure  we expect strategy 
com s cost of product support and other services as a percentage of its total product support and other services revenues will decrease 
the cost  however  of providing hosting services and operating the strategy 
com network may become more significant as strategy 
com s customer base expands  further increasing the cost of product support and other services as a percentage of product support and other services revenues

com and general marketing efforts 
prior to the restructuring  weighted average staffing levels for sales and marketing personnel had increased by approximately in over additionally  during the first quarter of  we invested heavily in advertising  including a national television and print advertising campaign and other marketing efforts in order to create better market awareness of the value added potential of our product suite and strategy 
com and to seek to acquire market share 
we intend to continue to market our microstrategy software and other technology in our suite of products  however  we expect to reduce our overall advertising and marketing efforts going forward in order to better align our costs with anticipated revenues

research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  and to million in as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from in to in  and to in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to hiring additional research and development personnel to continue development of strategy

amortization of intangible assets 
we have recorded   and million in amortization expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect our rate of amortization expense to be substantially the same over the next two years  to the extent no additional intangible assets are acquired 
the primary components of amortization of intangible assets are discussed below 
in june  we entered into an agreement with the controlling stockholder of a software integrator 
the primary purpose of the agreement was to grant us the right to hire certain employees of the software integrator 
in exchange  we issued  shares of class a common stock to the controlling stockholder 
we will issue up to million in additional shares of class a common stock over the next two years based on an agreed upon formula including revenue and attrition objectives 
we have recorded million related to the first installment as an intangible asset in the accompanying balance sheet 
the first installment is being amortized over the estimated period of benefit of two years 
beginning in december and throughout  we acquired the right to use certain internet domain names for million 
we are amortizing these assets over their expected useful life of years 
in december  in connection with the purchase of intellectual property and other tangible and intangible assets relating to ncr s teracube project  we allocated million of the million purchase price to intangible assets 
the intangible assets are being amortized over their useful lives  ranging from one to three years 
as of december   million of such amount had been amortized and million and million are expected to be amortized in and  respectively 
in january  we recorded million for acquired intangible assets representing the excess of the fair market value of the shares issued in exchange for the non controlling interests in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the intangible assets consist primarily of distribution channels  trade names and customer lists and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their weighted average useful lives of approximately years 
in process research and development 
in december  in connection with the purchase of intellectual property and other tangible and intangible assets relating to ncr s teracube project  we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
in estimating the fair value of the in process research and development projects acquired  we considered  among other factors  the stage of development of the teracube research and development projects at the time of the acquisition  projected estimated cash flows from those projects when completed and the percentage of the final products cash flows that is attributed to our core technology and that was already developed by ncr 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing teracube and  thereby  achieving technological feasibility and risk related to the impact of potential changes in future technology 
at the end of  we estimated we would incur additional expenses of approximately  to complete development  however  due to expansion of project scope  we incurred expenses of million during and intend to incur additional expenses in of approximately  in order to complete development 
remaining development efforts are focused on completing the development of certain sub products of teracube that will maximize efficiencies in the operation of our business intelligence and business intelligence products 
completion of these projects will be necessary before revenues are produced 
approximately of the final products estimated cash in flows are attributable to the acquired teracube technology 
we used a discount rate of when estimating the net present value of the projected incremental cash flows 
we expect to begin deriving revenues in when certain microstrategy products that include the teracube sub products are expected to be generally available 
restructuring and related charges 
in the third quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan designed to better align costs with expected revenues and strengthen the financial performance of the business 
the restructuring plan included a reduction of our workforce by or approximately of the worldwide headcount and the cancellation of new jobs for which candidates had not yet started with us 
all of these actions were completed prior to september  as a result of the reduction in headcount  we plan to consolidate facilities located in the vicinity of our northern virginia headquarters 
in addition  we are eliminating or reducing certain quarterly corporate events  including cancellation of our annual cruise 
finally  we are reducing expenditures on external consultants and contractors across all functional areas 
we anticipate realizing annual savings of approximately million as a result of these actions 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we incurred severance costs for terminated employees and costs for rescinded offers of employment  accelerated the vesting provisions of certain stock option grants  wrote off certain assets that are no longer of service  and accrued related professional fees 
in addition  michael j 
saylor  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  made grants of the company s class a common stock to terminated employees from his personal stock holdings 
since he is a principal shareholder of microstrategy  his actions are deemed to be an action undertaken on behalf of microstrategy for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we recognized an expense and a capital contribution by mr 
saylor for approximately million  which represents the fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
we also recognized a liability related to our commitments associated with the annual cruise for employees that was canceled 
the following table sets forth a summary of these restructuring costs and related charges in thousands severance and rescinded employment offers  stock grant and applicable payroll taxes  compensation expense on accelerated stock options  elimination of corporate events  write off of impaired assets accrual for professional fees total restructuring costs and related charges  included in the million restructuring charge are approximately million of cash costs and million in non cash related costs 
no events or circumstances occurred subsequent to the announcement of the restructuring plan requiring significant changes to management s original estimates 
substantially all restructuring costs and related charges had been paid as of december  if we are unable to reduce our costs more in line with revenues and strengthen the financial performance of our business  we may need to further adjust our cost structure through the execution of additional restructuring plans 
loss on investments 
in december  we received  shares of xchange  inc  formerly exchange applications  inc  stock valued at million  in consideration for the sale of microstrategy software  technical support and consulting services 
we sold all of our economic interest in these shares for a net realized gain of million during the first two quarters of during  we received an additional  shares of xchange s stock  valued at million  in consideration for the sale of microstrategy software  technical support and consulting services 
due to a significant decrease in the market value of their stock  the timing and amount of future recovery  if any  in the value of this asset is uncertain and we do not consider the decline in value to be temporary 
accordingly  we have written down the investment to its fair value at december   and recognized a loss of million during this loss was partially offset by a hedging transaction that resulted in a gain of million in the third quarter of provision for litigation settlement 
we and certain of our officers and directors are defendants in a private securities class action lawsuit alleging that we have violated section b of the exchange act  rule b promulgated thereunder  and section a and section a of the exchange act in connection with various statements that we had made with respect to our  and financial results 
in june  purported holders of our common stock filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the delaware court of chancery seeking recovery for various alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by certain of our directors and officers relating to our restatement of financial results for  and in october  we entered into agreements to settle these lawsuits 
both settlements are subject to confirmatory discovery  final documentation  court approval and certain other conditions 
under the class action settlement agreement  class members will receive five year unsecured promissory notes issued by the company having an aggregate principal amount of million and bearing interest at per year   shares of our class a common stock  with the number of shares to be increased if the market value of the shares  based on the dollar weighted average trading price during a specified trading period prior to the district court settlement hearing  is less than per share so that the minimum value of the shares is million  and warrants issued by the company to purchase million shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price between and per share  based on the dollar weighted average trading price during a specified trading period prior to the district court settlement hearing  with the warrants expiring five years from the date they are issued 
we will have the right  at any time  to prepay the promissory notes  or to mandatorily convert the promissory notes into shares of our class a common stock at a conversion price equal to of the dollar weighted average trading price per share for all round lot transactions in the stock on the nasdaq national market for the ten trading days ending two days prior to the date that written notice of conversion has been given 
the warrants may be exercised for cash or by tendering promissory notes valued for the purpose of warrant exercise at of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
based on the terms of the settlement agreements  we determined that a liability related to these actions was probable and that the value was reasonably estimable 
accordingly  we separately evaluated the individual components of the settlement agreements in consideration of existing market conditions and recorded an estimated charge of million for the cost of the litigation settlement  net of insurance proceeds of approximately million 
the final value of the settlements may differ significantly from the estimates currently recorded depending on a variety of factors including the market value of the stock when issued and potential changes in market conditions affecting the valuation of the other securities 
additionally  the settlements are contingent on confirmatory discovery  final documentation  court approval and certain other conditions 
accordingly  we will revalue the estimate of the settlements on a quarterly basis and at the time the securities are issued 
minority interest 
during the year ended december   we accreted dividends of  on the preferred stock of strategy 
com 
deferred compensation expense 
during  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock  of which options to purchase  shares of class a common stock were granted at exercise prices below fair market value 
we are amortizing million of compensation expense related to these options ratably over the five year vesting period 
in  and  compensation expense was   and  respectively 
we will record additional compensation expense of  in each year beginning through  and  in  if all of the related options vest 
provision for income taxes 
in  and  we recorded income tax expense of million  million and  respectively  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions where we are profitable 
prior to our initial public offering  we had elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
under subchapter s  our income was allocated to our individual stockholders rather than to us 
accordingly  no federal or state income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements  prior to june when we converted to a c corporation 
the provision for income taxes may increase as we become more profitable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
preferred stock dividends 
during  we recorded preferred stock dividends of million on our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock in lieu of cash and had accrued dividends of  as of december  which are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
all accrued dividends were paid subsequent to december  through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock in lieu of cash 
beneficial conversion feature 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge attributable to the beneficial conversion feature of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock based on the difference between the fair market value of the class a common stock on the closing date of the private placement and the conversion rate 
the conversion rate was computed based on the volume weighted average price of the stock for the trading days subsequent to the closing date in accordance with the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
if the conversion price is adjusted based upon certain contingent events as specified in the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock  an additional charge per share of outstanding preferred stock may be recorded in the future 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents product support and other services fees that are collected in advance for product license and product support and other services fees relating to multiple element software arrangements for which the fair value of each element cannot be established 
deferred revenue also includes product license and product support and other services fees relating to arrangements which required implementation related services that are significant to the functionality of features of the software product  including arrangements with subsequent hosting services 
aggregate deferred revenue was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to a few large contracts with customers that involved multiple elements  including software products  product support and other services  hosting services and strategy 
com services and for which our revenue recognition policy requires that the revenues be recognized on a percentage of completion basis or recognized over the entire term of the contract or the hosting period  as applicable 
we expect to recognize approximately million of this deferred revenue in  however  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support and other services  deferred revenue as of any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
liquidity and capital resources on december  and  we had million and million  of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  respectively  of which million is restricted cash as of december  the restrictions on this cash were removed in february cash used in operations was million for and cash provided by operations was  for the increase in cash used in operations from to was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in sales and marketing  and other operating expenses  which increased at a significantly greater rate than revenues 
however  during the latter part of the year  we took several actions to curtail our operating expenses including a reduction in headcount and discontinuation of various company sponsored events 
we have also implemented actions to reduce the use of outside consultants and contractors and other sales and marketing expenses 
these actions were taken to achieve our goal of making our business other than strategy 
com breakeven on an operating basis by the end of  excluding amortization  preferred dividends and other non operating expenses 
cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
in december  we received  shares of xchange stock  valued at million  in consideration for the sale of microstrategy software  technical support and application development 
we sold all of our economic interest in the shares we received in december for a total net realized gain of million 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from to reflected the sale of these shares and other short term investments primarily offset by the increase in restricted cash  capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer and office equipment required to support expansion of our operations and building of infrastructure to support strategy 
com 
during the third quarter of  we invested million in exchange for an approximate interest in a voice portal technology company 
our financing activities provided cash of million and million for and  respectively 
in june  we issued  shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock in a private placement to institutional investors for cash proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
dividends are payable quarterly at a rate of per annum  in cash or in shares of class a common stock 
the preferred stock is currently convertible into  shares of class a common stock based on the current conversion price of per share 
the conversion price may be adjusted at certain future dates  including the first and each subsequent anniversary of the initial issuance date  depending upon the trading price of the class a common stock and an agreed upon formula 
the preferred stock is also redeemable upon certain triggering events such as suspension from trading or failure of our class a common stock to be listed on the nasdaq national market for a period of five consecutive trading days and other events as defined in the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
as of december   none of these triggering events have occurred 
we also recorded a million charge attributable to the beneficial conversion feature of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock equal to the difference between the fair market value of the class a common stock on the closing date of the private placement and the conversion rate 
the conversion rate was computed based on the volume weighted average price of the stock for the trading days subsequent to the closing date in accordance with the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
if the conversion price is adjusted based upon certain contingent events as specified in the certificate of designations  preferences and rights of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock  such as the failure to maintain the effectiveness of the related registration statement and issuance of certain equity securities  an additional charge per share of outstanding preferred stock may be recorded in the future 
additionally  in accordance with the terms of the agreements relating to the issuance of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock  under certain circumstances  we may be required to pay substantial penalties to a holder of the preferred stock 
such penalties are generally paid in the form of interest payments  subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law 
in the third quarter of  we incurred  in penalties as a result of a day delay in the filing of a registration statement registering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of and in lieu of dividends on the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we paid dividends of million through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock in lieu of cash 
as of december   we had recorded unpaid accrued dividends of  all accrued dividends were paid subsequent to december  through the issuance of  shares of class a common stock in lieu of cash 
in october  we issued  shares of convertible preferred stock of strategy 
com to a group of institutional and accredited investors for cash proceeds of million  net of offering costs  in an initial closing 
in january  we issued an additional  million shares for million  in a second and final closing 
the preferred stock is convertible into class a common stock of strategy 
com on a one for one basis based upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
the total proceeds of million  net of offering costs  will be used to fund ongoing operations of our strategy 
com subsidiary 
microstrategy owns approximately of the economic interest in the outstanding equity of strategy 
com on an as converted  diluted basis 
as part of the class action litigation settlement agreement  in addition to issuing class a common stock  we expect to issue five year unsecured promissory notes having an aggregate principal amount of million and bearing interest at per year and warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock at an exercise price between and per share  with the warrants expiring five years from the date they are issued 
in connection with this arrangement  we expect to pay approximately million per year in interest charges commencing upon the settlement hearing date which has been scheduled for april  as of december   we had million in future minimum lease commitments for computer software and equipment 
additionally  in november  we signed a three year master lease agreement to lease up to million of computer equipment  of which we leased approximately million as of december  the lease bears interest at a rate equal to interest on three year us treasury notes plus to 
future drawdowns and interest rates under the lease agreement are subject to our credit worthiness 
currently  we are unable to draw down additional amounts under the lease agreement 
the principal source of cash from financing activities during was from the sale of  shares of class a common stock in which we raised million  net of offering costs 
in march  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank  which provided for a million unsecured revolving line of credit for general working capital purposes 
in may  we entered into a modification of the line of credit agreement  which  among other things  increased the aggregate credit available to include an additional letter of credit  removed any financial covenants and cured any financial covenant defaults 
the modified line of credit accrued interest at libor plus  included a unused line of credit fee  and required monthly payments of interest 
as of december   after consideration of outstanding letters of credit  we had million of borrowing capacity under this credit line 
as of december   the line of credit was secured by million of cash and cash equivalents  which is classified as restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the cash was restricted through february  at which time the agreement was terminated upon the closing of the credit facility agreement described below 
on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement which provides for aggregate borrowing capacity of up to million to be used for general working capital purposes the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan and a revolving line of credit for up to million  subject to certain borrowing base limitations  as defined in the agreement 
the credit facility  which matures in february  is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and replaces the previous line of credit agreement 
on february   we borrowed million under the term loan 
currently  we have million of borrowing capacity under the million revolving line of credit 
the remaining million under the revolving line of credit is expected to be available for future drawdowns upon completion of specified reporting requirements and other events defined in the agreement and subject to borrowing base limitations 
at our option  borrowings under the revolving line of credit will bear interest at a variable rate equal to libor plus or or at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus or  depending on the outstanding balance 
the credit facility also includes a unused letter of credit fee and requires monthly payments of interest and other fees beginning on the first day of the month following the execution of the agreement 
borrowings under the term loan are based upon certain levels of maintenance revenue and bear interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus 
in addition to the interest and other fees on borrowings under the credit facility  the lender has been granted warrants to purchase  shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment as set forth therein 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain certain financial covenants  the most restrictive of which are achieving certain minimum earnings amounts  as defined in the agreement  limitations on capital expenditures million in  million in and million in  minimizing the ability to invest further in subsidiaries  and limitations on incurring additional indebtedness 
we have grown significantly in and prior years in anticipation of high revenue growth 
we have recently taken actions to realign our cost structure to better match our expected revenue growth by reducing our workforce  limiting discretionary operating expenses and reducing capital expenditures 
if revenues do not grow at anticipated rates  and we are not able to promptly adjust our cost structure  we will need to take further measures to reduce costs or will require additional external financing through credit facilities  sale of additional equity in microstrategy or in our strategy 
com subsidiary  or by obtaining other financing facilities to support our current cost structure 
financing facilities may not be available on acceptable terms 
we believe that our existing cash  cash generated internally by operations and the new credit facility agreement entered into in february will meet our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next months 
recent accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for our fiscal year this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we have not entered into any material derivative contracts and do not have near term plans to enter into such contracts 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock for a number of reasons  including those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of o the size  timing and execution of significant orders and shipments  o the mix of products and services of customer orders  which can affect whether we recognize revenue upon the signing and delivery of our software products or whether revenue must be recognized as work progresses or over the entire contract period  o the timing of new product announcements  o changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  o market acceptance of business intelligence software generally and of new and enhanced versions of our products in particular  o the length of our sales cycles  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o our success in adding to our indirect distribution channels  o utilization of our consulting personnel  which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software products and consulting  education and support services  o changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and o seasonal factors  such as our traditionally lower pace of new sales in the summer 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rent  are relatively fixed 
we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter 
based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall 
we may lose sales  or sales may be delayed  due to the long sales and implementation cycles for our products  which would reduce our revenues to date  our customers have typically invested substantial time  money and other resources and involved many people in the decision to license our software products and purchase our consulting and other services 
as a result  we may wait nine months or more after the first contact with a customer for that customer to place an order while they seek internal approval for the purchase of our products and or services 
during this long sales cycle  events may occur that affect the size or timing of the order or even cause it to be canceled 
for example  our competitors may introduce new products  or the customer s own budget and purchasing priorities may change 
even after an order is placed  the time it takes to deploy our products and complete consulting engagements varies widely from one customer to the next 
implementing our product can sometimes last several months  depending on the customer s needs and may begin only with a pilot program 
it may be difficult to deploy our products if the customer has complicated deployment requirements  which typically involve integrating databases  hardware and software from different vendors 
if a customer hires a third party to deploy our products  we cannot be sure that our products will be deployed successfully 
our employees  investors  customers  vendors and lenders may react adversely to the revision of our  and revenues and operating results our future success depends in large part on the support of our key employees  investors  customers  vendors and lenders  who may react adversely to the revision of our  and revenues and operating results 
the revision of our  and revenues and operating results has resulted in substantial amounts of negative publicity about us and we believe that this publicity has caused some of our potential customers to defer purchases of our software or to do business with other vendors 
we may not be able to retain key employees and customers if they lose confidence in us  and our vendors and lenders may reexamine their willingness to do business with us 
in addition  investors may lose confidence  which may cause the trading price of our class a common stock to decrease 
if we lose the services of our key employees or are unable to retain and attract our existing and new customers  vendors and lenders  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our recognition of deferred revenue is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of actual revenues for succeeding periods our deferred revenue was million as of december  the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue depends on our performance of various service obligations 
because of the possibility of customer changes in development schedules  delays in implementation and development efforts and the need to satisfactorily perform product support services  deferred revenue at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain we may require additional external financing through credit facilities  sale of additional equity in microstrategy or in our strategy 
com subsidiary or by obtaining other financing facilities to support our operations  as we expect to incur operating losses through at least the third quarter of and possibly longer 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including o market conditions  o our operating performance  and o investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive to us 
if we are unable to raise capital to fund our operations  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we face litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations we and certain of our directors and executive officers are named as defendants in a private securities class action lawsuit and a shareholder derivative lawsuit relating to the restatement of our  and financial results 
although we have entered into agreements to settle such lawsuits  the settlements are subject to court approval and certain other conditions 
if the agreed upon settlements are not consummated  it is possible that we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
regardless of the outcome of these matters  it is likely that we will incur substantial defense costs and that such actions may cause a diversion of management time and attention 
the issuance of class a common stock as part of the proposed settlement of class action litigation and the exercise of warrants or conversion of notes issued as part of the litigation settlement could result in a substantial number of additional shares of class a common stock being issued the agreements we entered into to settle the private securities class action lawsuit and the derivative suit relating to the restatement of our  and financial results require us to issue shares of common stock with a market value of million  but not less than  shares 
based on the closing price of our class a common stock on march   we and certain of our executive officers would be obligated to issue approximately  shares of class a common stock to the class members as part of the settlement 
in addition  the settlement agreements require the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and promissory notes having an aggregate principal amount of million 
we would have the option at any time to convert the notes into a number of shares of class a common stock equal to the principal amount of the notes being converted divided by of the weighted average trading price of the class a common stock over a day period preceding our delivery of a notice of conversion  which could result in a substantial number of shares of class a common stock being issued 
for example  if the conversion of notes were based on the weighted average trading price of the class a common stock during the days ending march   we would be obligated to issue  shares of class a common stock if we elected to convert the notes 
the issuance of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock as part of the litigation settlement and future exercises or conversions of securities issued in the litigation settlement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of holders of class a common stock and may result in downward pressure on the price of our class a common stock 
shares in our public offerings may have been offered and sold in violation of the securities act and purchasers in one or more of these offerings may have claims that could result in a substantial amount of damages the company and selling shareholders sold an aggregate  shares of our class a common stock in our initial public offering on june  at a price adjusted for a for stock split in january per share of for an aggregate purchase price of million and  shares of our class a common stock at a price adjusted for a for stock split in january per share of in an additional public offering on february  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the shares were sold pursuant to prospectuses that contained financial statements that we subsequently revised 
the inclusion of these financial statements that required revision in the registration statements and prospectuses used in the offering and sale of these shares may constitute a violation of the securities act 
if the inclusion of these financial statements that required revision in the registration statements and prospectuses used in the offerings did constitute a violation of the securities act  the purchasers in these offerings would have the right for a period of one year from the date that they discovered  or should have discovered with reasonable diligence  that such financial statements required revision in the applicable registration statement and prospectus  but in no event later than three years from the date of the sale of shares to them  to obtain recovery of the consideration paid in connection with their purchase of class a common stock or  if they have already sold the stock  to sue us for damages based upon the difference between the price they paid for class a common stock and the proceeds they obtained from the sale of the stock 
the amount of these damages could be substantial 
we are currently unable to borrow additional amounts under our master equipment lease agreement we signed a three year master lease agreement to lease up to million of computer equipment  of which we have leased approximately million as of december  future drawdowns and interest rates under the lease agreement are subject to our credit worthiness 
currently  we are not able to draw down additional amounts under the lease agreement 
we face intense competition  which may lead to lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins  loss of market share and reduced revenue the markets for business intelligence software  customer relationship management applications  portals and narrowcast messaging technologies are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology 
in addition  many of our competitors in these markets are offering  or may soon offer  products and services that may compete with microstrategy products and those of strategy 
com 
microstrategy s most direct competitors provide o business intelligence software  o olap tools  o query and reporting tools  o web based static reporting tools  o information delivery and proactive reporting  o analytical customer relationship management products  o web traffic analysis applications  and o marketing automation 
each of these markets are discussed more fully below 
business intelligence software 
makers of business intelligence software provides business intelligence capabilities designed for integration  customization and application development 
leading analyst firms classify companies such as microsoft  oracle  hyperion  sap and sas to be leading providers of business intelligence software 
olap tools 
companies that build software to perform olap provide offerings competitive with the core microstrategy platform 
whether web based or client server  these tools give end users the ability to query underlying data sources without having to hand code structured query language queries 
most olap tools allow users to build their own calculations and specify report layouts and other options 
additionally  olap tools provide users the ability to navigate throughout the underlying data in an easy  graphical mode  often referred to as drilling 
providers of olap tools include cognos  microsoft  hyperion  brio  ibm  seagate and microsoft 
query and reporting tools 
query and reporting tools allow large numbers of end users to gain access to pre defined reports for simple analysis 
often the end users are able to specify some sort of run time criteria that customizes the result set for that particular person 
some limited drilling is also provided 
companies who produce query and reporting tools include business objects  cognos  oracle  seagate  and brio 
web based static reporting tools 
companies that offer software to deliver pre built reports for end user viewing and consumption can also compete with microstrategy 
these applications often lack the sophistication  robustness and scalability of microstrategy  but can be attractive for small  departmental applications 
vendors in this category include actuate  business objects  seagate  microsoft  computer associates and sas 
information delivery and proactive reporting 
companies that focus on the proactive delivery of information  via e mail  website  or other medium can compete with microstrategy s offerings 
typically these tools serve to push out compiled reports on a scheduled basis to sets of users based on job type 
microstrategy software has this technology integrated into its core platforms 
vendors of such technology include actuate  nquire  information builders and business objects 
analytical customer relationship management products 
companies that deliver customer relationship management products alone or in conjunction with e commerce applications  such as broadbase  broadvision  e 
piphany  vignette  compete with our analytical customer relationship management applications 
in contrast with providers of operational customer relationship management vendors  such as vantive and oracle  analytical customer relationship management deals more with customer segmentation  analysis and interaction as opposed to infrastructure and call centers 
web traffic analysis applications 
reporting and analysis tools can be specialized to deal specifically with the analysis of visitors to a company s website 
typically this involves extracting data from a web log file and importing it into a usable format  often in a relational database 
a set of analysis  sometimes customer centric in nature  is performed  and limited ad hoc reporting is permitted 
advanced applications in this space merge data from the web logs with other customer centric attributes to help provide a complete view of the customer base 
vendors in this space include accrue  net 
genesis and webtrends 
marketing automation 
applications focused on the automation and execution of marketing tasks  such as campaign management and delivery  compete with our customer relationship management applications and our narrowcast server platform 
leading vendors in this space include e 
piphany  xchange  chordiant and broadbase 
strategy 
com s most direct competitors provide o web portal and information networks  o vertical internet portals and information networks  and  o wireless communications and wireless access protocol enabled products 
each of these market segments are discussed more fully below 
web portals and information networks 
web portals and information networks  such as microsoft network  yahoo  lycos  excite  america online and infospace 
com  offer an array of information that is similar to information provided by strategy 
com 
vertical internet portals and information networks 
expedia  weather 
com  cnbc 
com  abc 
com  espn 
com  microsoft investor  stockboss  microsoft carpoint  infobeat  internet travel network and others have developed custom applications and products to commercialize  analyze and deliver specific information over the internet 
these systems are usually tailored to one application  such as providing news  sports or weather  but in the aggregate  they offer applications similar to those provided by strategy 
com 
any one of these companies could expand their offerings to more closely compete with strategy 
com 
wireless communications and wireless access protocol enabled products 
wireless communications providers  such as at t  sprint  mci worldcom  nextel communications  british telecom  deutsche telekom  pagenet  nokia  ericsson  com and palm offer a variety of mobile phones and wireless devices over which strategy 
com delivers information 
these companies may develop in house information services or partner with other companies to deliver information that is competitive to that offered by strategy 
com 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the business intelligence industry 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
increased competition may lead to price cuts  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others 
by doing so  they may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers 
our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors 
these relationships may limit our ability to sell our products through specific distribution channels 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
these developments could harm our ability to obtain maintenance revenues for new and existing product licenses on favorable terms 
we have expanded our business rapidly and our failure to manage this expansion effectively  as well as the strain it places on our resources  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition we have expanded rapidly 
our total number of employees has grown from on december  to  on december  this expansion has placed significant demands on our administrative  operational  financial and personnel resources and is expected to continue doing so 
in particular  our expansion into international markets has led to increased financial and administrative demands 
for example  managing relationships with new foreign partners require additional administrative burdens and managing foreign currency risks requires expanded treasury functions 
we may also need to expand our support organization to develop our indirect distribution channels in new and expanded markets and to accommodate growth in our installed customer base 
in addition  the development of the strategy 
com network could divert the time and attention of our senior management from our other business 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  currently is responsible for the strategic planning and direction of both our microstrategy software business and the strategy 
com business 
if mr 
saylor does not effectively manage his time and attention between these businesses  it could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  assimilate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  and sanju k 
bansal  our vice chairman  executive vice president and chief operating officer 
if we lose the services of one or both of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  assimilate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our inability to develop and release product enhancements and new products to respond to rapid technological change in a timely and cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changing customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies can quickly make existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
we believe that our future success depends largely on three factors o our ability to continue to support a number of popular operating systems and databases  o our ability to maintain and improve our current product line  and o our ability to rapidly develop new products that achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
business intelligence applications are inherently complex  and it can take a long time to develop and test major new products and product enhancements 
in addition  customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our products will soon become available 
we cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  introductions of new competitive products or customer requirements  nor can we be sure that our new products and product enhancements will achieve market acceptance 
the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our ability to market our existing products the emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing products 
this could happen  for example  if new web standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our microstrategy applications 
although the core database component of our business intelligence solutions is compatible with nearly all enterprise server hardware and operating system combinations  such as os  as  unix and windows  our application server component runs only on the windows nt operating system 
therefore  our ability to increase sales currently depends on the continued acceptance of the windows nt operating system 
we cannot market many of our current business intelligence applications to potential customers who use unix operating systems as their application server 
we would have to invest substantial resources to develop a unix product and we cannot be sure that we could introduce such a product on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
the legal environment regarding collection and use of personal information is uncertain and new laws or government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition although some existing laws govern the collection and use of personal information obtained through the internet or other public data networks  it is unclear whether they apply to our products and us 
most of these laws were adopted before the widespread use and commercialization of the internet and other public data networks 
as a result  the laws do not address the unique issues presented by these media 
due to increasing use of the internet and the dramatically increased access to personal information made possible by technologies like ours  the us federal and various state and foreign governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of personal information of users of the internet and other public data networks 
although we attempt to obtain permission from users prior to collecting or processing their personal data  new laws or regulations governing personal privacy may change the ways in which we and our customers and affiliates may gather this personal information 
there may be significant costs and delays involved with adapting our products to any change in regulations 
our business  and in particular the strategy 
com network  depends upon our receiving detailed personal information about subscribers in order to provide them with the services they select 
privacy concerns may cause some potential subscribers to forego subscribing to our service 
if new laws or regulations prohibit us from using information in the ways that we currently do or plan to do  or if users opt out of making their personal preferences and information available to us and strategy 
com affiliates  the utility of our products will decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our customers  our network or strategy 
com affiliates misuse personal information  our legal liability may be increased and our growth may be limited 
the federal trade commission has recently launched investigations of the data collection practices of various internet companies 
in addition  numerous individuals and privacy groups have filed lawsuits or administrative complaints against other companies asserting that they were harmed by the misuse of their personal information 
if comparable legal proceedings were commenced against us  regardless of the merits of the claim  we could be required to spend significant amounts on legal defense and our senior management s time and attention could be diverted from our business 
in addition  demand for our products could be reduced if companies are not permitted to use clickstream data derived from their websites 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in europe  the european union directive on data protection requires member countries to implement legislation that prohibits any european entity from sharing personal data collected from eu persons with entities in any country that is not deemed to have adequate data protection laws 
currently  the united states data protection laws are not deemed to be adequate  and some data transfers from european entities to us may be prohibited unless explicit consent is obtained from eu data subjects  we agree to specified contractual privacy safeguards that are approved by eu authorities  or we comply with the requirements of the so called safe harbor program between the united states and the eu 
it may not be feasible for us to obtain the required consent or to make the necessary contractual commitments 
currently  we have not sought to be certified under the safe harbor program  and our data collection and handling practices may not qualify under this program 
although enforcement of eu data protection laws against us companies is currently subject to a standstill  this standstill will expire in june  and some countries  including france  are currently attempting to enforce data protection laws with respect to data exports to the united states  notwithstanding the existence of the standstill 
our business may suffer if either the internet infrastructure or the wireless communication infrastructure is unable to effectively support the growth in demand placed upon it the strategy 
com network and our other products depend increasingly upon the internet infrastructure and wireless communications infrastructures to collect information and deliver information to customers 
these infrastructures may not continue to effectively support the capacity  speed and security demands placed upon them as they continue to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use and increased requirements for data transmission by users 
even if the necessary infrastructure or technologies are developed  we may incur considerable costs to adapt our solutions accordingly 
furthermore  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays due to damage to portions of its infrastructure or attacks by hackers 
these outages and delays could impact the websites using our products or hosting the strategy 
com network and could materially affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if the market for business intelligence software fails to grow as we expect  or if businesses fail to adopt our products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected nearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of business intelligence software and related technical support  consulting and education services 
we expect these sales to account for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
although demand for business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the market for business intelligence software applications is still emerging 
resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior may impair the further growth of this market  as may other developments 
we cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or  even if it does grow  that businesses will adopt our solutions 
we have spent  and intend to keep spending  considerable resources to educate potential customers about business intelligence software in general and our solutions in particular 
however  we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our products achieve any additional market acceptance 
if the market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently expect  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
our relationship with strategy 
com could create the potential for conflicts of interest we hold an approximately economic interest in the equity of strategy 
com 
conflicts may arise between us and other investors in strategy 
com  including the allocation of business opportunities  the sharing of rights  technologies  facilities  personnel and other resources  and the fiduciary duties owed by officers  directors and other personnel who provide services to both us and strategy 
com 
strategy 
com has only recently introduced its network and it is uncertain whether it will achieve widespread acceptance strategy 
com has implemented the finance  news  weather  sports and traffic channels of its network 
strategy 
com may introduce additional channels as part of our suite of information and we could be subject to delays or difficulties in this commercial introduction 
we expect that a portion of our future revenue will depend on fees from subscribers for the use of the strategy 
com network service  from products and services offered through this network  and from royalties from strategy 
com affiliates who bundle the strategy 
com network with their own product and service offerings 
if this service  or the products and services offered through it  fails to achieve widespread customer acceptance  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  revenue from strategy 
com would be adversely affected if strategy 
com affiliates do not perceive that the integration of the strategy 
com network with their product and service offerings will increase demand for their products and services or will otherwise be able to generate a sufficient return on their investment in the use of our network 
strategy 
com is expected to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and will require additional external financing strategy 
com is expected to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and will require additional external financing to support its operations and it may be difficult to obtain addition financing on acceptable terms 
if strategy 
com is unable to raise capital to fund its operations  our business and spending results could be materially and adversely affected 
strategy 
com relies on strategy 
com affiliates to market and deliver strategy 
com services to their customers and if strategy 
com is unable to enter into arrangements with a sufficient number of strategy 
com affiliates  or if strategy 
com affiliates are unable to interest their customers in strategy 
com services or have difficulty in delivering those service to their customers  our business and reputation will suffer strategy 
com relies on strategy 
com affiliates to market and deliverstrategy 
com services to their customers 
strategy 
com may not attract strategy 
com affiliates who will market its services effectively and deliver services reliably to customers 
if strategy 
com affiliates fail to deliver services reliably  strategy 
com could face liability claims from its subscribers and our reputation could be damaged 
strategy 
com includes contractual provisions limiting its liability to the subscriber for failures and delays  but these limits may not be enforceable and may not be sufficient to shield strategy 
com from liability 
strategy 
com will seek to obtain liability insurance to cover problems of this sort  but insurance may not be available and the amounts of its coverage may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on strategy 
com s success in recruiting and maintaining successful relationships with strategy 
com affiliates and the performance of the systems deployed and maintained by strategy 
com affiliates which strategy 
com does not control 
if strategy 
com is unable to recruit strategy 
com affiliates or maintain its relationships with strategy 
com affiliates  or if strategy 
com affiliates perform poorly in the delivery of strategy 
com services to customers  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
because of the rights of our two classes of common stock  and because we are controlled by our existing stockholders  these stockholders could transfer control of microstrategy to a third party without anyone else s approval or prevent a third party from acquiring microstrategy we have two classes of common stock class a common stock and class b common stock 
holders of our class a common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class b common stock  except that holders of class a common stock have one vote per share while holders of class b common stock have ten votes per share 
as of march   holders of our class b common stock owned or controlled  shares of class b common stock  or of the total voting power 
michael j 
saylor  our chairman and chief executive officer  controlled  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock  or of total voting power  as of march  accordingly  mr 
saylor is able to control microstrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors  amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders  including mergers  going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions and their terms 
our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class b common stock  almost all of who are employees of our company or related parties  to transfer shares of class b common stock  subject to the approval of a majority of the holders of outstanding class b common stock 
mr 
saylor or a group of stockholders possessing a majority of the outstanding class b common stock could  without seeking anyone else s approval  transfer voting control of microstrategy to a third party 
such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
mr 
saylor will also be able to prevent a change of control of microstrategy  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
the conversion of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares could result in substantial numbers of additional shares of class a common stock being issued if our market price declines during periods in which the conversion price of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares may adjust as of december   the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares are convertible into class a common stock at a conversion price equal to per share 
this conversion price may be adjusted based on the market price of our class a common stock if the preferred stock remains outstanding on june  and on each subsequent anniversary of such date  if such adjustment would result in a lower conversion price 
the conversion price may also be adjusted upon the occurrence of various events  including the failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement to which these shares relate and the issuance of certain equity securities 
as a result  the lower the price of our class a common stock at these intervals  the greater the number of shares the holder will receive upon conversion after any such adjustment 
for example  the number of shares of class a common stock that we would be required to issue upon conversion of all  series a redeemable convertible preferred shares  excluding shares issued as accrued dividends  would increase from approximately  shares  based on the applicable conversion price of per share as of december   to approximately o  shares if the applicable conversion price decreased  o  shares if the applicable conversion price decreased  o  shares if the applicable conversion price decreased  or o  shares if the applicable conversion price decreased by for example  if the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock conversion price were adjusted to a conversion price of per share the closing price of our class a common stock on march  we would be required to issue  shares of class a common stock upon conversion of all  series a preferred shares 
to the extent the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares are converted or dividends on the series a preferred shares are paid in shares of class a common stock rather than cash  a significant number of shares of class a common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of our class a common stock and encourage short sales 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our class a common stock 
in that case  we could be required to issue an increasingly greater number of shares of our class a common stock upon future conversions of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares as a result of the annual and other adjustments described above  sales of which could further depress the price of our class a common stock 
the conversion of and the payment of dividends in shares of class a common stock in lieu of cash on the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our class a common stock 
no selling stockholder may convert its series a redeemable convertible preferred shares if upon such conversion the selling stockholder together with its affiliates would have acquired a number of shares of class a common stock during the day period ending on the date of conversion which  when added to the number of shares of class a common stock held at the beginning of such day period  would exceed of our then outstanding class a common stock  excluding for purposes of such determination shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of series a preferred shares which have not been converted 
nevertheless  a selling stockholder may still sell a substantial number of shares in the market 
by periodically selling shares into the market  an individual selling stockholder could eventually sell more than of our outstanding class a common stock while never holding more than at any specific time 
we may be required to pay substantial penalties to the holders of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares if specific events occur in accordance with the terms of the agreements relating to the issuance of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares  we are required to pay substantial penalties to a holder of the series a preferred shares under specified circumstances  including  among others o nonpayment of dividends on the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares in a timely manner  o failure to deliver shares of our class a common stock upon conversion of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares after a proper request  o nonpayment of the redemption price at maturity of the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares  o failure to hold a meeting of our stockholders on or before july  to approve the issuance of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of and in lieu of cash dividends on the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares  or o the unavailability of the registration statement relating to the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of and in lieu of cash dividends on the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares to cover the resale of such shares for more than brief intervals 
such penalties are generally paid in the form of interest payments  subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law 
in the third quarter of  we incurred  in penalties as a result of a day delay in the filing of a registration statement registering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of and in lieu of dividends on the series a redeemable convertible preferred shares 
we rely on our strategic channel partners and if we are unable to develop or maintain successful relationships with them  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on strategic channel partners  such as original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers  to license and support our products in the united states and internationally 
in particular  the years ended december   and  channel partners accounted for  directly or indirectly  approximately  and of our total product license revenues  respectively 
our channel partners generally offer customers the products of several different companies  including some products that compete with ours 
although we believe that direct sales will continue to account for a majority of product license revenues  we intend to increase the level of indirect sales activities through our strategic channel partners 
however  we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to expand indirect sales in this manner 
we may not be able to attract strategic partners who will market our products effectively and who will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in developing and maintaining successful relationships with those strategic partners 
if we are unable to develop or maintain our relationships with these strategic partners  our business  operating results and financial condition will suffer 
third party providers of information and services for strategy 
com services may fail to provide us such information and services or may also provide such information and services to our competitors strategy 
com relies on third parties to provide information and services for the strategy 
com network 
for example  strategy 
com relies on thomson financial to provide users of strategy 
com financial information services with stock quote information 
if one or more of these providers were to stop working with strategy 
com  strategy 
com would have to rely on other parties to provide the information and services it needs 
other parties may not be willing to do so on reasonable terms 
furthermore  strategy 
com does not have long term agreements with its providers of information and services and cannot restrict them from providing similar information and services to its competitors 
as a result  strategy 
com s competitors may be able to duplicate some of the information and services that it provides and may  therefore  find it easier to enter the market for personal intelligence and compete with strategy 
com 
strategy 
com affiliates will rely on strategy 
com to maintain the infrastructure of the network and any problems with that infrastructure could expose strategy 
com to liability from its strategy 
com affiliates and their customers strategy 
com affiliates depend on strategy 
com to maintain the software and hardware infrastructure of the strategy 
com network 
if this infrastructure fails or strategy 
com affiliates or their customers otherwise experience difficulties or delays in accessing the network  strategy 
com could face liability claims from them 
strategy 
com expects to include contractual provisions limiting its liability to its strategy 
com affiliates for system failures and delays  but these limits may not be enforceable and may not be sufficient to shield strategy 
com from liability 
strategy 
com will seek to obtain liability insurance to cover problems of this sort  but insurance may not be available and the amounts of its coverage may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims 
strategy 
com is vulnerable to system failures  which could cause interruptions or disruptions in its service the hardware infrastructure on which the strategy 
com system operates is located at the exodus communications data center in northern virginia 
strategy 
com may not be able to manage this relationship successfully to mitigate any risks associated with having its hardware infrastructure maintained by exodus 
unexpected events such as natural disasters  power losses and vandalism could damage its systems 
telecommunications failures  computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems could adversely affect the operation of its systems 
insurance policies may not provide adequate compensation for any losses that may occur due to any damages or interruptions in its systems 
accordingly  we may need to make capital expenditures in the event of damage 
strategy 
com does not currently have a formal disaster recovery plan 
periodically  strategy 
com experiences unscheduled system downtime that results in its website being inaccessible to subscribers 
although strategy 
com has not suffered material losses during these downtimes to date  if these problems persist in the future  users  strategy 
com affiliates and advertisers could lose confidence in strategy 
com services 
system capacity constraints may diminish our ability to generate revenues from strategy 
com a substantial increase in the use of the products and services offered by strategy 
com could strain the capacity of its systems  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
system failures or slowdowns could adversely affect the speed and responsiveness of the strategy 
com network 
these would diminish the experience for stategy 
com subscribers and affect our reputation 
the ability of stategy 
com systems to manage a significantly increased volume of transactions in a production environment is unknown 
as a result  stategy 
com faces risks related to its ability to scale up to expected transaction levels while maintaining satisfactory performance 
if strategy 
com transaction volume increases significantly  it may need to purchase additional servers and networking equipment to maintain adequate data transmission speeds 
the availability of these products and related services may be limited or their cost may be significant 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our software  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
policing such unauthorized use is difficult  and we cannot be certain that we can prevent it  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our products may be susceptible to claims by other companies that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in late march  ncr corporation asked us to consider licensing certain technology which ncr alleges is covered under patents that they hold 
ncr has implied that if we are unwilling to license this technology they may seek to enforce their patents against us 
we have not yet had an opportunity to fully review these matters 
in the event ncr seeks to enforce any of these patents and if such patents are found to be valid and enforceable against microstrategy  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we are not currently able to estimate the potential range of loss and the outcome of the uncertainty is unknown 
accordingly  no provision for this matter has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
managing our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully or in a cost effective manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition international sales accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including o changes in foreign currency exchange rates  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o costs of localizing products for foreign countries  o lack of acceptance of localized products in foreign countries  o longer accounts receivable payment cycles  o difficulties in managing international operations  o tax issues  including restrictions on repatriating earnings  o weaker intellectual property protection in other countries  and o the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  our business  operating results and financial condition 
the nature of our products makes them particularly vulnerable to undetected errors  or bugs  which could cause problems with how the products perform and which could in turn reduce demand for our products  reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us software products as complex as ours may contain errors or defects  especially when first or subsequent versions are released 
although we test our products extensively  we have in the past discovered software errors in new products after their introduction 
despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers  errors may be found in new products or releases after commercial shipments begin 
this could result in lost revenue or delays in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not be effective under the laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions 
although there have been no product liability claims against us to date  our license and support of products may involve the risk of these claims 
a successful product liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the price of our stock may be extremely volatile the market price for our class a common stock has historically been volatile and could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons o quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  o developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  o technological innovations or new products  o governmental regulatory action  o general conditions in the software industry  o increased price competition  o changes in earnings estimates by analysts  o any change in the actual or expected amount of dilution attributable to issuances of additional shares of class a common stock upon conversion of the series a redeemable convertible preferred stock or as a result of the litigation settlement  or o other events or factors 
many of the above factors are beyond our control 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have particularly affected the market price of many software companies  often without regard to their operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we do not have material derivative financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash in short term  fixed income financial instruments 
these fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate risk and may fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels at december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in foreign exchange rates would have had an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques we may implement will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations
