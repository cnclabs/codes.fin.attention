as a result of these cost reduction measures and expected increase in revenue  the company expects significantly improved operating results in fiscal fiscal results decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to charges to restructure the company s manufacturing operations by moving operations from mexico to thailand and closing the mexican facility 
the decrease is also due to operating losses generated by the acquired adflex operation and increased interest expense as a result of the adflex acquisition 
revenue related to the acquired adflex operation decreased throughout fiscal as a result of pre acquisition customer service and quality issues and the operations relatively high cost structure

revenue from the core high end flexible circuits continues to increase 
revenue is expected to show modest sequential increases throughout fiscal net sales for fiscal were  a increase from net sales of  the increase in over was due  in part  to the increase in flexible circuit revenue from the disk drive industry 
in addition  a large portion of the increase was due to revenue generated from the telecommunication  network systems  consumer and other industries related to the august acquisition of adflex 
these increases offset a reduction in revenue generated from lead wire interconnects as the disk drive industry transitioned to integrated interconnects including the company s head interconnect flex hif and flex suspension assembly fsa 
less than of revenue for fiscal was generated by lead wire assemblies as compared to for fiscal revenue from the disk drive industry generated of fiscal revenue and is expected to be higher during fiscal due to fsa revenue increasing at a faster pace than increases in revenue from other industries 
in addition  during fiscal  of the revenue was generated from network system applications  from consumer applications and from applications from other industries 
the acquisition of adflex has reduced the company s dependence on the disk drive industry significantly from its historical levels of of revenue 
fiscal should benefit from continued growth in the demand for high technology flexible circuit products including the company s fsa and flex gimbal suspension assembly fgsa and an expected economic improvement in the later part of the year 
significant progress has been made in gaining customer acceptance of the company s fsa product and the introduction of the next generation fgsa product will be integral to increasing revenue in future years

engineering spending increased in fiscal as compared to due to spending related to the development of base material manufacturing process in the new maple plain minnesota facility 
the fiscal and spending was concentrated on fsa development and the development of a process to manufacture material for use in producing double sided  plated through hole flexible circuits 
fiscal engineering spending is expected to concentrate on manufacturing process improvements  further fsa and fgsa technology improvements  semiconductor packaging substrates and other high end flexible circuit technology development related to new products 
restructuring charges the fiscal second quarter includes asset impairment and restructuring charges of  and  related to the restructuring of the company s manufacturing operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
while the company transacts business predominately in us dollars a portion of its sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect the company s cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
to reduce the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations  the company enters into short term forward foreign currency exchange contracts hedges in the regular course of business to manage its risk exposure  not as speculative instruments 
typically  these contracts have maturities of months or less 
the forward exchange contracts generally require the company to exchange thailand baht for us dollars or u 
s dollars for thailand baht at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
the gains or losses on hedges of transaction exposure are included in income in the period in which the exchange rates change 
the gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company periodically reviews the outlook for expected currency exchange rate movements as well as the policy on desired future foreign currency cash flow positions long  short  balanced for those currencies in which the company has significant activity 
expected future cash flow positions and strategies are continuously monitored 
at september   the company had one open forward exchange contract to buy a total of  thai baht 
no assurance can be given that the company s hedging strategies will prevent future currency fluctuations from adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
