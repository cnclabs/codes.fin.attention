funds from operations 
management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in march  nareit issued a clarification of the definition of ffo 
the clarification provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets are not to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
in addition  effective january   nareit clarified that ffo should include both recurring and non recurring operating results except those defined as extraordinary items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
the company s calculation of ffo shown below is consistent with nareit s recent clarification and includes an adjustment of  for the year ending december  to include gains on sales of real estate held for sale and other assets during that year 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents the company s ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization equity in earnings distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries preferred dividends gain on real estate amortization of discounts deferred gains and other funds from operations nareit has recommended supplemental disclosure concerning certain capital expenditures  leasing costs and straight line rents as shown below in thousands year ended december straight line rents amortization of restricted stock grants building improvements tenant improvements new leases lease renewals leasing commissions new leases lease renewals leasing commissions amortized upgrades on acquisitions anticipated at the date of purchase inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to five year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at a higher base rent if rents on the existing leases are below the then existing market rate
