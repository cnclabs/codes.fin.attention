the company periodically will apply to receive additional loans under the working capital loan in the credit facility to the extent such loan has been paid down under the lockbox arrangement 
there can be no assurance that bank of america will continue to loan the company additional funds under the credit facility as the outstanding loan is paid down periodically under the sweep arrangement and the company applies for additional loans

as described above  as of december   the company is in default of the credit facility as a result of non compliance under certain financial covenants 
in addition  the company is also in default of its credit facility as a result of not making its principal payments of approximately million due october  and january  and for failure to repay the bridge loan and related interest which were due on august  on march   the company and bank of america entered into a forbearance agreement relating to the credit facility 
under the terms of the forbearance agreement  bank of america has agreed that it will not foreclose on  or institute legal action to collect  the debt outstanding under the credit facility  including the bridge loan  until march   or until the earlier termination of the forbearance agreement 
bank of america may terminate the forbearance agreement prior to march   upon the occurrence of certain events as described below 
the forbearance agreement modifies the payment terms of the debt outstanding under the credit facility 
the company has agreed to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the debt outstanding under the credit facility on the first day of each month  commencing on april   and to repay  in principal each month  beginning on may  the company is required to make an additional principal repayment on october   in an amount of the quarter of  or the gross proceeds to the company of the second installment payment pursuant to the sale of the ifm business 
in addition  the company is required to prepay on the th day following the last day of each fiscal year  beginning on march   an amount equal to the company s excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement for each fiscal year 
the company has agreed to pay any accrued and unpaid interest on the bridge loan on the first day of each month  commencing on april   and to repay  in principal on or before each of may and august  the unpaid balance of the bridge loan will be due on november  interest will continue to accrue on the principal balances of all debt outstanding under the credit facility at the bank of america prime rate plus 
upon expiration or early termination of the forbearance agreement  interest will accrue at the rate then in effect plus 
the forbearance agreement expires on march   but generally may be terminated earlier by bank of america if any of the following occur i the company files for bankruptcy or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy is filed against the company  ii the company fails to timely make any scheduled principal or interest payment under the credit facility  as modified by the forbearance agreement  iii the company breaches any covenant in the forbearance agreement  iv the company violates the modified financial covenants set out in the forbearance agreement relating to minimum net worth  capital expenditures  and minimum ebitda  and the specific ratios for debt service coverage  leverage  interest coverage  and debt to capitalization  v the company fails to deliver on or prior to april  title to certain personal assets of marshall b 
hunt to secure the bridge loan  vi the company fails to deliver on or prior to april  a mortgage of all real property owned by the company to secure the revolver loan  vii the company fails to comply with any demands by bank of america relating to borrowing base audits  viii the company fails to hire a new chief operating officer by june   ix the company fails to cooperate with the operational review being conducted by the management consulting firm  or x the company uses the collateral under the credit facility to repay subordinated debt  except as permitted by bank of america

the warrants will have a strike price of per share and will be exercisable for three years from the date of issuance 
the warrants will contain antidilution protection for issuance of shares at less than fair market value 
upon the expiration or early termination of the forbearance agreement  if the company remains in default under the credit facility  the debt outstanding under the credit facility will become due and payable 
the failure by the company either to extend the forbearance period or refinance such debt would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  liquidity and ability to pay its debts as they become due 
impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of the company s operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
the credit facility costs result primarily from interest and principal and are not affected by inflation 
further  although the company often sells products on a fixed cost basis  the average time between the receipt of any order and delivery is generally only a few days 
while the company has not historically been adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials and components  several gpo agreements to which the company is a party limit the company s ability to raise prices 
thus  future increases in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
this could change in situations in which the company is producing against a substantial backlog and may not be able to pass on higher costs to customers 
in addition  interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable and therefore may increase with inflation 
the company makes all sales of foreign customers in us dollars 
thus  notwithstanding fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates  the company s profit margin for any purchase order is not subject to change due to exchange rate fluctuations after the time the order is placed

adequate additional funds  whether from the financial markets or from other sources  may not be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
insufficient funds may cause the company difficulty in financing its accounts receivables and inventory and may result in delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s product acquisition  licensing  marketing or research and development programs or opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

see item legal proceedings 
although the company believes the suit is without merit  the outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
if the ultimate disposition of this matter is determined adversely to the company  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company believes that it has defenses to the claims of liability and for damages in the action against it  there can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed against the company or its subsidiaries 
further  there can be no assurance that the lawsuit will not have a disruptive effect upon the operations of the business  that the defense of the lawsuit will not consume the time and attention of the senior management of the company and its subsidiaries  or that the resolution of the lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of the company 
limited manufacturing experience the company s success will depend in part on its ability to manufacture its products in compliance with international and domestic standards such as iso  the fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations and other applicable licensing and regulatory requirements in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
the company has historically outsourced the manufacturing of most of its product lines to third parties while remaining responsible for that work 
in the fourth quarter of  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its circle c r and pheres flow tm specialty catheter product lines into its manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of its lifeport tm  infuse a port r and infuse a cath r product lines to the manchester facility from a facility in norwood  massachusetts 
during  the company transitioned the manufacturing of the vortex tm  titanport tm and omegaport r product lines to the manchester facility from norfolk medical 
the company has undergone and expects to continue to undergo regular gmp inspections in connection with the manufacture of its products at the company s facilities 
the company s success will depend  among other things  on its ability to efficiently manufacture different products and to integrate newly acquired products with existing products 
the company s failure to successfully commence the manufacturing of new products  to maintain or increase production volumes of new or existing products in a timely or cost effective manner or to maintain compliance with iso  the ce mark requirements  gmp regulations or other applicable licensing or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
management of growth  risks associated with acquisitions the rapid growth experienced by the company to date has placed  and could continue to place  significant demands on the company s management  operational and financial resources 
from time to time  the company may pursue additional strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies as a means of expanding its existing product lines and distribution channels 
as the medical devices industry continues to consolidate  the company expects to face increasing competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that financing for such acquisitions will be obtainable on terms acceptable to the company or that such acquisitions will be successfully completed 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  iii responsibility for undiscovered or contingent liabilities and iv loss of key employees of acquired operations 
the relocation of manufacturing operations for acquired product lines to the company s manufacturing facility in manchester  georgia may also result in interruptions in production and back orders 
no assurance can be given that the company will not incur problems in integrating any future acquisition and there can be no assurance that any future acquisition will increase the company s profitability 
further  the company s results of operations in fiscal quarters immediately following a material acquisition may be materially adversely affected while the company integrates the acquired business into its existing operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time charges and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
manufacturing relationships while the company believes it has a good relationship with each third party that manufactures the company s products  there can be no assurance that such relationships will not deteriorate in the future 
deterioration in these manufacturing relationships could cause the company to experience interruptions in its manufacturing and delivery processes and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  when the manufacturing arrangements with these third parties expire  the company will have to make other manufacturing arrangements or manufacture products at company facilities 
the failure to effectively plan for the expiration of these agreements could also result in interruption of the manufacturing and delivery processes for these products and have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on patents  trademarks  licenses and proprietary rights the company believes that its competitive position and success has depended  in part  on and will continue to depend on the ability of the company and its licensors to obtain patent protection for its products  to defend patents once obtained  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing upon patents and proprietary rights held by third parties  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
the company s policy is to protect its proprietary position by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications relating to technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of its business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign patents and united states and foreign patent applications 
the company also is a party to license agreements with third parties pursuant to which it has obtained  for varying terms  the right to make  use and or sell products that are covered under such license agreement in consideration for royalty payments 
many of the company s major products are subject to such license agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company or its licensors have or will develop or obtain additional rights to products or processes that are patentable  that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications filed by the company or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect any technology that is licensed to the company 
in addition  no assurances can be given that any patents issued or licensed to the company or other licensing arrangements will not be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages for the company s business or products 
in such event the business  results of operations and financial condition of the company could be materially adversely affected 
a number of medical device companies  physicians and others have filed patent applications or received patents to technologies that are similar to technologies owned or licensed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company is aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect the company s ability to make  use or sell its products 
united states patent applications are confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office pto  and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six or more months after filing 
any conflicts resulting from third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned or licensed by the company and limit the ability of the company or its licensors to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents are issued to other companies that contain competitive or conflicting claims  the company may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
there can be no assurance that the company would not be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development or commercialization of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical devices industry 
although the company has not been a party to any material litigation to enforce any intellectual property rights held by the company  or a party to any material litigation seeking to enforce any rights alleged to be held by others  future litigation may be necessary to protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights or know how owned by the company or to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of the company and others 
the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by the company 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  could require the company to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using certain of its products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also relies on trade secrets and proprietary technology that it seeks to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any breach  that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for the development and protection of brand loyalty and associated goodwill in connection with its products 
the company s policy is to protect its trademarks  trade names and associated goodwill by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign trademark applications relating to its products and business 
the company owns numerous united states and foreign trademark registrations and applications 
the company also relies upon trademarks and trade names for which it does not have pending trademark applications or existing registrations  but in which the company has substantial trademark rights 
the company s registered and unregistered trademark rights relate to the majority of the company s products 
there can be no assurance that any registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names of the company will not be challenged  canceled  infringed  circumvented  or be declared generic or infringing of other third party marks or provide any competitive advantage to the company 
potential product liability because its products are intended to be used in healthcare settings on patients who are physiologically unstable and may be seriously or critically ill  the company s business exposes it to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the medical devices industry 
in addition  many of the medical devices manufactured and sold by the company are designed to be implanted in the human body for extended periods of time 
component failures  manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks with respect to these or other products manufactured or sold by the company could result in injury to  or death of  a patient 
the occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  safety alert relating to  or other fda or private civil action affecting one or more of the company s products or responsible officials 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in amounts that it deems sufficient for its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such coverage will be available with respect to or sufficient to satisfy all claims made against the company or that the company will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could result in costly litigation and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the company initiated a voluntary product recall of its dialysis and central venous catheter kit product lines due to small pinholes in the product packaging 
although the recall covers products manufactured since  product returns through december  were approximately  units 
no product complaints have been received to date for either pinholes in the packaging or infection of the implant site that could be attributed to the packaging being contaminated 
the product recall will remain open with fda until the reconciliation to shipments has been completed and a recall termination request has been approved 
new product introductions although the vascular access product industry has not experienced rapid technological change historically  as the company s existing products become more mature  the importance of developing or acquiring  manufacturing and introducing new products that address the needs of its customers will increase 
the development or acquisition of any such products will entail considerable time and expense  including acquisition costs  research and development costs  and the time and expense required to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  which approvals are not assured  and any of which could adversely affect the business  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
there can be no assurance that such development activities will yield products that can be commercialized profitably or that any product acquisition can be consummated on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
to date  substantially all of the company s products have been developed in conjunction with third parties or acquired as a result of acquisitions consummated by the company 
the inability of the company to develop or acquire new products to supplement the company s existing product lines could have an adverse impact on the company s ability to fully implement its business strategy and further develop its operation 
customer concentration the company s net sales to its three largest customers accounted for  and of total sales during  and  respectively 
the loss of  or significant curtailments of purchases by  any of the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key suppliers the company purchases raw materials and components for use in manufacturing its products from many different suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing supplier relationships or secure additional suppliers as needed 
in addition  stepic has generated of its sales through distribution of products of three major manufacturers 
see item business description of business by industry segment product distribution 
the loss of a major supplier  the deterioration of the company s relationship with a major supplier  changes by a major supplier in the specifications of the components used in the company s products  or the failure of the company to establish good relationships with major new suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success is substantially dependent on the performance  contributions and expertise of its executive officers and key employees 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of marshall b 
hunt  its chairman and chief executive officer  and william e 
peterson  jr  its president  each of whom is party to an employment agreement with the company and on each of whom the company maintains key man life insurance in the amount of million 
the company is wholly dependent on certain key employees to manage its distribution business 
the company is also dependent on its ability to attract  retain and motivate additional personnel 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees or the company s inability to attract  retain or motivate the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
control by certain shareholders marshall b 
hunt  william e 
peterson  jr  and roy c 
mallady  jr 
collectively own more than of the company s outstanding common stock 
these shareholders  if they were to act together  would have the power to elect all of the members of the company s board of directors  amend the amended and restated articles of incorporation of the company the articles and the amended and restated bylaws of the company the bylaws and effect or preclude fundamental corporate transactions involving the company  including the acceptance or rejection of proposals relating to a merger of the company or the acquisition of the company by another entity 
accordingly  these shareholders are able to exert significant influence over the company  including the ability to control decisions on matters on which shareholders are entitled to vote 
healthcare reform pricing pressure the healthcare industry in the united states continues to experience change 
in recent years  several healthcare reform proposals have been formulated by members of congress 
in addition  state legislatures periodically consider healthcare reform proposals 
federal  state and local government representatives will  in all likelihood  continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies  and ongoing public debate of these issues can be expected 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors to persons providing medical services 
in particular  the healthcare industry is experiencing market driven reforms from forces within the industry that are exerting pressure on healthcare companies to reduce healthcare costs 
managed care and other healthcare provider organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population in the united states that receives medical benefits through such organizations and in terms of the influence and control that they are able to exert over an increasingly large portion of the healthcare industry 
managed care organizations are continuing to consolidate and grow  increasing the ability of these organizations to influence the practices and pricing involved in the purchase of medical devices  including certain of the products sold by the company  which is expected to exert downward pressure on product margins 
both short and long term cost containment pressures  as well as the possibility of continued regulatory reform  may have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation the company s products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including  but not limited to  the fda and state and foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  the company must obtain specific clearance or approval from the fda before it can market new products or certain modified products in the united states 
the fda administers the fdc act 
under the fdc act  most medical devices must receive fda clearance through the section k notification process k or the more lengthy premarket approval pma process before they can be sold in the united states 
to obtain k marketing clearance  a company must show that a new product is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a product already legally marketed and which does not require a pma 
therefore  it is not always necessary to prove the actual safety and effectiveness of the new product in order to obtain k clearance for such product 
to obtain a pma  a company must submit extensive data  including clinical trial data  to prove the safety  effectiveness and clinical utility of its products 
the process of obtaining such clearances or approvals can be time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that all clearances or approvals sought by the company will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays adversely affecting the marketing and sale of the company s products 
fda s quality system regulations also require companies to adhere to certain good manufacturing practices requirements  which include testing  quality control  storage  and documentation procedures 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is monitored through periodic site inspections by the fda 
in addition  the company is required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion of its products 
the federal trade commission also regulates most device advertising 
in addition  international regulatory bodies often establish varying regulations governing product testing and licensing standards  manufacturing compliance eg  compliance with iso standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements and pricing and reimbursement levels 
the inability or failure of the company to comply with the varying regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the company s ability to sell its products internationally and thereby adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations could subject the company to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  product seizures  injunctions  recalls  possible withdrawal of product clearances  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions against the company or its responsible officials  any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
federal  state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes  as are administrative interpretations of regulatory requirements 
no assurance can be given that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  the company has received section fd and warning letters from the fda regarding the company s compliance with fda regulations 
the company has worked with the fda to resolve these issues 
there can be no assurance the company will not receive additional fd s or warning letters in the future or that it will be able to reach an acceptable resolution of the issues raised in such letters 
limitations on third party reimbursement in the united states  the company s products are purchased primarily by hospitals and medical clinics  which then bill various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans  for the healthcare services provided to patients 
government agencies  private insurers and other payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure and reimburse hospitals for medical treatment at a fixed rate based on the diagnosis related group drg established by the united states health care financing administration hcfa 
the fixed rate of reimbursement is based on the procedure performed and is unrelated to the specific devices used in that procedure 
if a procedure is not covered by a drg  payors may deny reimbursement 
in addition  third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment was unnecessary  inappropriate or not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
reimbursement of procedures implanting the company s vascular access ports and catheter products is currently covered under a drg 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such implantation will continue to be available  or that future reimbursement policies of third party payors will not adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products on a profitable basis 
failure by hospitals and other users of the company s products to obtain reimbursement from third party payors  or changes in government and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing the company s products  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the medical devices industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company currently competes with many companies in the development  manufacturing and marketing of vascular access ports  dialysis and apheresis catheters and related ancillary products and in the distribution of medical devices 
some of these competitors have substantially greater capital resources  management resources  research and development staffs  sales and marketing organizations and experience in the medical devices industry than the company 
these competitors may succeed in marketing their products more effectively  pricing their products more competitively  or developing technologies and products that are more effective than those sold or produced by the company or that would render some products offered by the company noncompetitive 
factors inhibiting takeover certain provisions of the articles and bylaws may delay or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in its best interest 
among other things  these provisions establish certain advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings  provide for the classification of the board of directors  provide that only the board of directors or shareholders owning or more of the outstanding common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders and establish supermajority voting requirements with respect to the amendment of certain provisions of the articles and bylaws 
in addition  the board of directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  no par value the preferred stock  issuable in one or more series  with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of the common stock 
the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the company s consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of all or substantially all of its assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of such stock 
furthermore  certain provisions of the georgia business corporation code may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
deterioration in general economic conditions the sales of the products manufactured and distributed by the company may be adversely impacted by a deterioration in the general economic conditions in the markets in which the company s products are sold 
likewise  a deterioration in general economic conditions could cause the company s customers and or third party payors to choose cheaper methods of treatment not utilizing the company s products 
a decline in the company s sales attributable to these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other companies  the company is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s objective of financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s earnings and cash flows 
to manage this risk  the company entered into an interest rate cap agreement the cap agreement with nationsbank  a major financial institution  to minimize the risk of credit loss 
the company used this cap agreement to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the cap agreement was not held for trading purposes 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under its credit facility  which expires in july certain amounts outstanding under the credit facility were subject to the cap agreement  which expired in october for more information on the cap agreement  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements
