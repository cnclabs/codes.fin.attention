item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook the company s results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices  and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment  especially in subsalt geological formations which generally are located in to feet of water and in deepwater to  feet areas of the gulf of mexico 
over the first three of the past six years  generally favorable trends in these factors led to increased activity levels in the gulf of mexico 
in the past three years  however  the distraction caused by consolidation activity by the oil and gas exploration and production companies and generally unfavorable trends in the exploration and development activity factors have caused a corresponding reduction in the level of oil and gas development activity 
development activity in water depths greater than feet  where larger structures requiring more steel tonnage are needed  began declining in and continued to decline throughout  which has had a negative effect on the demand for the available capacity of the major platform fabricators serving the gulf of mexico  with a resulting decline in pricing levels for their services through the end of demand for the company s products and services have remained low for the past three years 
the resultant low level of backlog of projects  with reduced profit margins  resulted in a weaker performance in compared with revenue in was million  a decrease compared to revenue  and net income was million  a decrease compared to net income 
the continued low activity levels in the fabrication sector of the oil and gas industry was reflected in the company s backlog at december   which was million  as compared to million at the end of the dollar value of projects available in the market is significantly below those levels of three to four years ago and the company s backlog is being similarly eroded 
competition for available projects remains intense and near term  future margins will likely remain low 
cost reduction measures are continuously reviewed to meet these conditions 
in the longer term  demand for the company s services will continue to depend largely upon actual or anticipated prices for oil and gas  which are difficult to predict 
although the average price of oil and gas has increased since early  the activity in the offshore fabrication area remains depressed 
at some point  however  it is expected that demand for the company s products and services should recover as oil and gas reserves are reduced and the company s customers are forced to replace them 
during  the company s workforce remained stable ranging from approximately to employees 
due to currently reduced demand for the company s products and services  the company does not anticipate the need to engage a material amount of contract labor in the foreseeable future 
most of the company s revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours worked to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the company s revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the year ended december  revenue decreased as a result of the delay in the anticipated recovery in the late cycle sectors  such as offshore fabrication  in which the company operates 
the prolonged delay in the recovery of offshore fabrication caused a reduced demand and  thus reduced margins on the goods and services the company provides 
these factors also generated a decrease in the volume of direct labor hours applied to contracts for the year ended december   compared to million in versus million in 
the combination of reduced volume and lower margins caused a decrease in gross profit to million of revenue for the year ended december  compared to gross profit of million of revenue for the year ended december  the cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor hours and raw materials allocated to specific projects and indirect costs such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs that are associated with production but are not directly related to a specific project 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these expenses as a percentage of revenue were compared to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of approximately  was primarily related to increased legal fees associated with negotiating the agreement with the former southport  inc shareholders to an early payout of contingent payments 
the company s net interest income increased to million for compared to thousand for the company s cash provided by operations has remained at a level that has allowed the company to make capital expenditures and acquisitions without incurring any debt  thus increasing its cash and short term investments 
other expense increased to  in from  in this expense is primarily comprised of the company s portion of the net loss of mindoc  llc as it continues to design and market the mindoc floating platform concept for deepwater drilling and production 
comparison of the years ended december  and the company s revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  compared to million in revenue for the year ended december  revenue decreased as a result of low activity levels in the oil and gas industry during which created reduced demand and  thus  downward pressure on the pricing of the company s goods and services 
these factors also generated a decrease in the volume of direct labor hours applied to contracts for the year ended december   compared to million in versus million in 
the combination of reduced volume and lower pricing caused a decrease in gross profit by to million of revenue for the year ended december   compared to the million of revenue of gross profit for the year ended december  cost of revenue was million in compared to million in cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the fabrication process  including direct costs such as direct labor hours and raw materials allocated to specific projects and indirect costs such as supervisory labor  utilities  welding supplies and equipment costs that are associated with production but are not directly related to a specific project 
as a percentage of revenue  these costs increased to in compared to in the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  although the absolute dollar cost of the company s general and administrative expenses decreased by million for  these expenses as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in the savings of million of general and administrative expenses for the year was produced by i consolidating general and administrative costs associated with the subsidiaries  ii reduced costs associated with decreased production levels  and iii substantial reduction in incentive pay 
the company s net interest income increased to  for compared to  for the company completed its initial public offering in april  and used the proceeds to eliminate all of its outstanding bank debt and provide working capital to the company 
since that time  the company s cash provided by operations has increased to a level that has allowed the company to make capital expenditures and acquisitions with little or no debt and to increase its cash and short term investment balances
