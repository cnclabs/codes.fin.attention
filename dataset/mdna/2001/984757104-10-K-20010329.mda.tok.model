the effective tax rate in is quite different 
the company was an s corporation until the recapitalization and was only required to pay taxes at the state level 
all other income taxes were paid directly by the sole stockholder 
in  the company reported a pre tax loss because of the bonus related to the recapitalization

liquidity and capital resources the company has consistently generated positive cash flow from operations  excluding the million non recurring bonus charge in this positive cash flow has been sufficient  in the past  to allow the company to grow its business 
for the first four months of  the company was an s corporation 
any excess cash was distributed to the sole stockholder either in the form of compensation or s corporation distributions 
those outflows totaled approximately million in  which occurred in the first four months of the year 
subsequent to the c corporation conversion  no such distributions have been made 
the absence of those distributions  combined with positive cash flow from operations  has facilitated the company s growth and is expected to continue to do so 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fifty two weeks ended january  and december   respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  the company believes that the liquidity provided by operating cash flow can be better understood by reference to the company s adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda reflects the elimination of various items  unrelated to the company s fundamental operating cash flow  from ebitda 
these items include the one time special bonus paid at the time of the recapitalization and the compensation and benefits  net of current annual compensation and benefits  paid to the sole stockholder in the first four months of prior to the recapitalization

the average capital expenditure for each new retail store was approximately  total capital expenditures in and the fifty two weeks ended january  were million and million  respectively 
there were store openings in and store openings in the fifty two weeks ended january  the company anticipates that capital expenditures in will total approximately million 
these funds will be spent primarily to open new stores currently planned for  new manufacturing equipment and in distributions operations and for new information systems 
in july  the company sold million shares of common stock at per share in an initial public offering and listed its stock on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ycc 
the proceeds to the company  after deducting underwriting fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
on july   the company used these proceeds  together with million of bank borrowings under a new credit facility described below and available cash  to redeem million aggregate principal amount of outstanding subordinated debentures 
the redemption of these subordinated debentures resulted in an extraordinary charge to the statement of operations of million  net of tax 
these charges related to the write off of financing fees that had previously been deferred 
in july  the company entered into a new credit agreement with a consortium of banks the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement provided for a maximum borrowing of million and consists of a revolving credit facility for million and a term loan for million 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at december  was 
the new credit agreement matures on july   with any outstanding amounts due on that date  no payments of principal are due on the revolving credit facility until this maturity date 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments ranging from million to million in march  june  september and december of each year commencing on december  as of december    was outstanding under the revolving credit facility  thus leaving  in availability under the new credit agreement

the company s workforce was reduced by approximately employees as a result of this restructuring 
the company plans to fund the costs incurred as a result of the restructuring through funds to be generated from operating activities 
management believes that future annual savings associated with the consolidating and restructuring of its supply chain operations are estimated to be million 
the company is proceeding with its plan to open its new deerfield distribution center in the second quarter of fiscal impact of inflation the company does not believe inflation has a significant impact on its operations

recent accounting pronouncements in may  eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs was issued by the emerging issues task force

the company implemented this pronouncement during the fifty two week period ended december  all financial statements presented have been reclassified to reflect the provisions of this pronouncement 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the sab specifically sets forth criteria which must be satisfied in order for revenue to be recognized 
the adoption of sab no

the impact of adopting sfas on the company s financial statements at december  was not material 
page future operating results the following factors could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
the company may not be able to grow its business as planned 
yankee candle intends to continue to pursue a business strategy of increasing sales and earnings by expanding its retail and wholesale operations both in the united states and internationally 
the company s retail growth strategy depends in large part on its ability to open new stores in both existing and new geographic markets 
because yankee candle s ability to implement its growth strategy successfully will be dependent in part on factors beyond its control  including changes in consumer preferences and in its competitive environment  the company may not be able to achieve its planned growth or sustain its financial performance 
yankee candle s ability to anticipate changes in the candle and giftware industries  and identify industry trends will be critical factors in its ability to remain competitive 
the company expects that  as it grows  it will become more difficult to maintain the company s growth rate 
the company cannot give assurances that it will continue to grow at a rate comparable to yankee candle s historic growth rate or that its historic financial performance will continue as the company grows 
the company faces significant competition in the giftware industry  which could adversely affect its future operating results  financial condition and liquidity and its ability to continue to grow its business 
yankee candle competes generally for the disposable income of consumers with other producers in the giftware industry 
the giftware industry is highly competitive with a large number of both large and small participants 
yankee candle s products compete with other scented and unscented candle products and with other gifts within a comparable price range  like boxes of candy  flowers  wine  fine soap and related merchandise 
yankee candle s competitors include candle manufacturers and a variety of retail formats such as franchised candle store chains  specialty candle stores  gift and houseware retailers  department stores  mass market stores and mail order houses 
some of these competitors are part of large  diversified companies having greater financial resources and a wider range of product offerings than yankee candle 
this competitive environment could adversely affect the company s future revenues and profits  financial condition and liquidity and its ability to continue to grow its business 
yankee candle incurred indebtedness in connection with its recapitalization  and servicing its indebtedness could reduce funds available to grow its business 
at december  there was million of debt outstanding  which consisted of million in term loans and million from its revolving credit facility 
although yankee candle believes that its cash flow from operations and its available financing should be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for growing the business and servicing its debt  the company s level of long term indebtedness could reduce funds available to grow its business in the future 
yankee candle s success depends on its senior executive officers  the loss of whom could disrupt the company s business 
the company s success is substantially dependent upon the retention of its senior executive officers 
yankee candle does not have employment agreements with any of its senior executive officers  except its chief financial officer 
if the company s senior executive officers become unable or unwilling to participate in the business of yankee candle  its future business and financial performance could be materially affected 
page because yankee candle is not a diversified company and is dependent upon one industry  yankee candle has less flexibility in reacting to unfavorable consumer trends  adverse economic conditions or business cycles 
the loss of the company s manufacturing facility would disrupt its operations 
yankee candle relies exclusively on its manufacturing facility in whately  massachusetts to produce its candle products 
because most of its machinery is designed or customized by yankee candle to manufacture its products  and because the company has strict quality control standards for its products  the loss of its manufacturing facility  due to natural disaster or otherwise  would materially affect the company s operations 
although yankee candle s manufacturing facility is adequately insured  the company believes it would take a minimum of nine months to replace the plant and machinery to a level equivalent to their current level of production and quality control standards 
the company may experience a decline in its retail comparable store sales  which could cause the price of its common stock to drop 
comparable store sales from the company s retail business have contributed to yankee candle s overall sales growth 
the company s retail comparable store sales could be adversely impacted by competition or yankee candle s inability to execute its business strategy 
if the company s retail comparable store sales decline for any reason  yankee candle could experience a decline in its revenues and income  which could lower the price of the company s common stock 
seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in the company s business could affect the market for its common stock 
yankee candle s net sales and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
the company has historically realized higher net sales and operating income in its fourth quarter  particularly in its retail business  which is the larger portion of the company s sales 
yankee candle believes that this has been due primarily to an increase in giftware industry sales during the holiday season of the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  yankee candle may also experience quarterly fluctuations in its net sales and income depending on various factors  including  among other things  the number of new retail stores the company opens in a particular quarter  changes in the ordering patterns of our wholesale customers during a particular quarter  and the mix of products sold 
most of the company s operating expenses  such as rent expense  advertising and promotional expense and employee wages and salaries  do not vary directly with net sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if net sales for a particular quarter are below the company s expectations  the company could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and therefore a net sales shortfall could have a disproportionate effect on the company s operating results for that quarter 
as a result of these factors  yankee candle may report in the future net sales and operating results that do not match the expectations of market analysts and investors 
this could cause the trading price of the company s common stock to decline 
yankee candle is controlled by forstmann little co  whose interests may conflict with those of other stockholders 
partnerships affiliated with forstmann little co 
own approximately of the company s outstanding common stock and control the company 
accordingly  they are able to elect the company s entire board of directors  page control the company s management and policies  and determine  without the consent of the company s other stockholders  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the company s stockholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
they are also able to prevent or cause a change in control of yankee candle and are able to amend the company s articles of organization and by laws at any time 
the interests of the forstmann little partnerships also may conflict with the interests of the other holders of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
it bears this risk in two specific ways 
first  it has debt outstanding 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its new credit agreement  which bears interest at variable rates 
this facility is intended to fund operating needs if necessary 
because this facility carries a variable interest rate pegged to market indices  the company s results of operations and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
based on december  borrowing levels  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing a million additional pre tax charge or credit to the statement of operations 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash 
this risk impacts fair values  earnings and cash flows 
excess cash is primarily invested in overnight repurchase agreements backed by us government securities 
these are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on the company s balance sheet 
the balance of such securities at december  was approximately million 
earnings from cash equivalents were approximately  for the fifty two weeks ended december  based on december  cash equivalents  a increase or decrease in current market interest rates would have the effect of causing an approximately  additional pre tax credit or charge to the statement of operations 
the company buys a variety of raw materials for inclusion in its products 
the only raw material that is considered to be of a commodity nature is wax 
wax is a petroleum based product 
however  its market price has not historically fluctuated with the movement of oil prices 
rather  over the past five years wax prices have generally moved with inflation 
at this point in time  operations outside of the united states are immaterial 
accordingly  the company is not exposed to substantial risks arising from foreign currency exchange rates
