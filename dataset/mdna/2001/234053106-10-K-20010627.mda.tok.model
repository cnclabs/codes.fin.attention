item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this document 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for additional information on our operating segments and geographic areas 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased by billion  or  to billion as compared to billion for fiscal year the growth is attributable to our computer and office supplies segment  which experienced a revenue increase of primarily due to higher international computer supplies sales  product expansion including traditional office products which we began offering with the acquisition of ba pargh company  llc  on may   the impact of the copier and fax consumables we began offering with the acquisition of arlington industries  inc on october   revenue earned by our new subsidiary virtual demand  and growth in ibm product sales 
increases were primarily volume related 
united states computer supplies net revenues  excluding ba pargh and ibm product sales  increased by approximately compared to the prior year 
the computer and office supplies revenue increase was partially offset by a revenue decrease in our professional tape products segment primarily due to prior year industry price decreases which continued to affect our revenues on a comparable basis 
management has recently implemented a restructuring plan to improve both revenues and earnings for the professional tape products segment  which focused on new leadership  efforts to rationalize warehouses to reduce costs and improve customer service  better utilization of inside telemarketing teams and development of new sales and marketing initiatives 
the overall net revenue increase was also offset by the impact of the pfsweb spin off completed in july pfsweb net revenues included in our consolidated results of operations  net of intercompany eliminations  were million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year as previously mentioned  international sales were a primary contributor to our growth during the last fiscal year 
international computer and office supplies net revenues  excluding revenues related to the ibm master distribution agreements  increased by approximately compared to last year 
effective march   we elected to close our singapore operation and consolidate the remaining business activity into our asia pacific headquarters in australia 
this reduction in revenue was offset by the acquisition of etertin y cia  sa in october  which added revenue in argentina 
all of our other international regions experienced growth in fiscal year except for our latin america subsidiary based in miami due to a change in certain tariffs  which has made it more attractive for our customers to source product locally rather than import from our miami facility 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues was for the year ended march   compared to for the prior year 
our gross profit for the prior year was negatively impacted by incremental operational charges of million 
these charges represent costs for the closure of our singapore operations  write downs of inventory and vendor programs 
we believe that these charges were incremental to normal operations during this period 
excluding these incremental charges for the prior year  our gross profit was 
the increase in gross profit percentage  on a basis adjusted for these incremental charges  was the result of several different factors 
in the united states and international business divisions  the prior year gross profit amounts for the quarter ended december  reflect the beginning of our intense focus on improving the key balance sheet areas of inventory and accounts receivable 
in order to make improvements in this area  we avoided certain vendor incentive programs  which negatively impacted our gross margins during this period 
since then  we have elected not to participate in certain of the programs 
this is part of our ongoing focus on improving inventory levels to strengthen our balance sheet position and improve our overall return on invested capital 
additionally  we have focused during the past fiscal year on improving all aspects of customer profitability  which has had a favorable impact on gross margins 
these increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a decline due to the relatively higher revenue growth in ibm product sales  which are typically at lower margins 
also negatively impacting our gross profit percentage was the reduction in our professional tape products revenue and pfsweb revenue resulting from the spin off  which have typically carried higher margin percentages than the remainder of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended march  were million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues  for the year ended march   excluding acquisition related costs and the amounts related to the disposition of a business 
our sg a expenses for the year ended march  were negatively impacted by certain non recurring costs of million relating to separation costs associated with the pfsweb spin off  as well as certain costs related to the closure of ba pargh s nashville headquarters and restructuring activities for the professional tape products division 
our sg a expenses for the year ended march  were negatively impacted by non recurring costs of million related to certain repositioning and separation activities associated with the pfsweb spin off  increases in allowances for bad debts related primarily to issues in our latin american accounts receivable  legal and professional fees related to an unsolicited acquisition offer  costs incurred in connection with closing our singapore operation  and certain other charges 
excluding these incremental charges  our sg a percentages would be and  respectively  for the years ended march  and excluding pfsweb sg a expenses included for the full year in fiscal year and for the first quarter of fiscal year  the increase in overall expenses is due to the acquisitions of arlington industries  inc in october  ba pargh company  llc in may  and etertin y cia  sa in october the decline in sg a as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the significant investments in resources and technology to implement new contracts and further develop the infrastructure for pfsweb during the prior fiscal year 
this impact was partially offset by a reduction in net revenues to certain large customers  which typically have lower sg a expense ratios 
however  we experienced a corresponding favorable impact on the increase in ibm product sales  which typically have lower sg a expense ratios 
as a result of our purchase of the memphis distribution assets in may and the termination of the transaction services agreement with pfsweb  we believe that  beginning the latter half of fiscal  our sg a costs as a percentage of revenue will decline compared to fiscal our cost to operate the memphis distribution facility should be lower than the fee previously paid to pfsweb to perform this service 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we began to invest in additional logistics and information technology personnel costs in anticipation of our purchase of the memphis superhub 
we anticipate that these cost redundancies will exist in the first two quarters of fiscal year  but will be eliminated during the third quarter of fiscal year beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  we expect that this purchase transaction will be accretive to earnings 
see business pfsweb 
additionally  during fiscal year  sg a has been impacted by continuing investments in our high growth areas of office products and virtual demand  in advance of expected revenue streams 
interest expense 
interest expense increased during fiscal year  primarily due to our repurchase of million shares of common stock  the acquisitions of arlington industries  inc  ba pargh company  llc and etertin y cia  sa  and growth in the working capital requirements of our ibm business 
additionally  interest rate increases during calendar year negatively impacted our interest expense for the current year 
these increases have been partially offset by recent decreases in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
as discussed in business pfsweb  our existing master distribution agreements with ibm expire on varying dates prior to december  we do not intend to renew these agreements and have notified ibm of this intention 
as a result  our financial results for fiscal will be impacted 
revenue should decline as a result of no longer operating this business 
our consolidated gross profit percentage should increase since this business typically operates at lower gross profit margins 
our sg a percentage should also increase since costs are lower than in our normal business 
our net operating income as a percentage of sales should improve 
interest costs should decline since we will no longer have the working capital requirements of this business

fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended march  increased billion  or  to billion as compared to billion for the year ended march  computer and office supplies net revenues increased for the year ended march   compared to the year ended march  the computer and office supplies business segment includes our domestic and international computer supplies operations and ibm product sales 
the net revenue increase in the computer and office supplies business compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the arlington acquisition  growth in the international computer supplies business and growth in ibm product sales 
us computer supplies net revenues  excluding arlington and ibm product sales  declined by compared to the prior year 
this business experienced a decline in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the prior year s quarter  but improved to low single digit growth rates in the remaining quarters of the year 
in the two years ended march   the growth in wholesale sales for the domestic computer supplies business slowed from previously realized levels 
we believe this reduction was due  in large part  to slower wholesale industry growth  large channel shifts  turmoil in certain customer segments and slower printer placements 
net revenues in the international computer supplies operations  excluding revenues related to the ibm master distribution agreements  increased by approximately for the year ended march  compared to the prior year 
we experienced growth in all international subsidiaries within this segment  with particularly strong growth rates in mexico and australia 
effective march   we elected to close our singapore operation and consolidate the remaining business activity into our asia pacific headquarters in australia 
net revenues related to our ibm product sales increased due to higher sales volumes under both our north american and european distributor agreements 
professional tape products net revenues decreased for fiscal compared to the prior year due primarily to price degradation in certain product lines and the disposition of the steadi systems professional hardware business in march of this decline was partially offset by the acquisition of certain professional tape businesses during fiscal pfsweb also experienced an increase in its service fee based activity as a result of new contracts and expansion of existing contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues was for the year ended march  as compared to for the prior year 
our gross profit for the year was negatively impacted by incremental operational charges of million 
these charges represent charges for the closure of our singapore operations  writedowns of inventory  and vendor programs and we believe that these charges are incremental to normal operations 
excluding these incremental charges for the year  our gross profit was 
the decrease in our gross profit as a percent of net revenues was primarily due to our previously announced focus on the key balance sheet areas of inventory and accounts receivable during the latter half of fiscal in order to make improvements in this area  we avoided certain vendor incentive programs  that for comparative purposes have been previously reflected in our prior year results 
additionally  in order to improve inventory levels  we entered into certain isolated transactions to sell certain inventory at lower than usual margins 
during fiscal  we were also able to take advantage of certain enhanced product sourcing opportunities which did not continue in fiscal and  thus  negatively impacted the fiscal gross profit percentage on a comparative basis 
additionally  the gross profit percentage declined in the international computer supplies business due primarily to growth in international retail business  which typically carries lower margins 
also contributing to the overall decline in gross profit percentage was the revenue growth in ibm product sales  which are also typically at lower margins 
daisytek s gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by incremental costs associated with pfsweb s large number of new client implementations 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses for the year ended march  were million or of net revenues  as compared to million  or of net revenues for the year ended march   excluding acquisition related costs and the loss on disposition of business in each period 
the increase in sg a expenses and the related increase in sg a as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal is primarily attributable to i the acquisition of arlington on october   ii the investments in resources and technology to implement new contracts and further develop infrastructure for pfsweb  and iii a reduction in net revenues to large office superstores  which typically have lower sg a expense ratios 
this impact on the sg a percentage was partially offset by an increase in ibm product sales with lower sg a expense ratios 
sg a expenses for the year ended march  included incremental charges primarily related to certain repositioning and separation activities associated with the pfsweb spin off  increases in allowances for bad debts related primarily to issues in our latin american accounts receivable  legal and professional fees related to an unsolicited acquisition offer  for costs incurred in connection with closing our singapore operation  and for certain other charges 
acquisition related costs 
in june  we completed the acquisition of the tape company through a stock for stock merger  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
during fiscal  we recorded costs of about million applicable to transition  integration and merger activities within our professional tape products segment 
during fiscal  we incurred acquisition and integration costs of million related to accounting  legal and other costs applicable to the acquisition of the tape company 
loss on disposition of business 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to the disposition of our professional tape hardware business 
in fiscal  we reversed million of this charge as management was able to avoid some of the costs associated with this disposition 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  interest expense was higher for the year ended march   primarily due to higher debt balances caused by business acquisitions and higher working capital levels throughout the year 
these negative impacts were partially offset by proceeds from the pfsweb initial public offering  which was completed in december our weighted average interest rate was for both fiscal year and for information concerning the provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between effective rates and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
dilution because of the wide range of exercise prices on outstanding stock options  the number of shares included in our dilutive earnings per share calculation and the resulting diluted earnings per share could vary greatly depending on the average market price of our common stock 
the following table summarizes the dilutive shares outstanding at various price points using common stock outstanding at may  of  diluted shares average share price outstanding liquidity and capital resources we expect to fund our anticipated cash requirements  including the anticipated cash requirements of our capital expenditures and acquisition activity  if any  with internally generated funds and other various external sources of funds that may be available to us 
the external sources of funds include our credit agreements and amendments thereto and may include the future issuance of debt  equity or other securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to access capital markets in the future on terms that will be satisfactory to us 
we believe that such internally and externally generated funds will provide us with adequate liquidity and capital necessary for the next twelve months 
operating activities provided net cash of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
working capital  excluding the current portion of long term debt  decreased to million at march  from million at march  the reduction in working capital was primarily attributable to the spin off of pfsweb on july   which resulted in a reduction in net current assets  including cash 
in addition  our working capital position was impacted during the period by acquisitions of both the ba pargh and etertin businesses  an increase in inventory primarily related to the ibm products  which was offset by accounts payable associated with this inventory  and an increase in accounts receivable related to the growth in existing business units during this fiscal year 
our principal use of funds for investing activities was a reduction in cash of million as a result of the disposition of our investment in pfsweb in connection with the spin off on july  additionally  we have used funds for capital expenditures of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  we used funds for the acquisition of businesses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures consisted primarily of additions to upgrade our management information systems  costs associated with new facilities  and historically have also included costs related to the expansion of pfsweb distribution facilities  both domestic and foreign 
in addition to expenditures related to the memphis distribution assets purchased from pfsweb during may see business pfsweb  we anticipate spending approximately million for upgrades and additions to facilities during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ba pargh during may  certain acquired debt of approximately million was paid in full 
in addition  we acquired debt of approximately million in connection with the etertin acquisition  of which approximately was paid down during fiscal year this impact was partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and proceeds received on the issuance of stock under an employee stock purchase program 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the pfsweb initial public offering 
the entire cost of the ba pargh and etertin acquisitions was funded through our availability under our credit facility and cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  during the second quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors initially authorized a share buyback program of up to of the outstanding shares of common stock 
that program was completed in september and  at that time  the board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program 
as of march   both programs were completed and we had acquired approximately million shares at a total cost of million  funded with proceeds from our credit facility 
domestic credit facilities in december  we entered into an agreement with certain banks for a revolving line of credit facility in the united states that has a maximum borrowing availability of million and expires on december  availability under the credit facility is subject to certain borrowing base limitations  including eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined 
this credit facility replaced our previous united states credit facility  which would have expired on january  borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest  at our option  at the prime rate of the lead bank or a eurodollar rate plus an adjustment ranging from to depending on our financial performance 
as of march   the outstanding balance under this credit facility was million and  based on our borrowing limit at march   million was available for future borrowings 
the credit facility also includes an expandable feature to increase the maximum borrowing to million  subject to various conditions precedent 
during april  we added another million of available credit under this feature  increasing the maximum borrowing availability to million 
foreign credit facilities during august  our canadian subsidiary entered into an agreement with a canadian bank for a revolving term loan 
the term loan  which expires on august   allows us to borrow canadian or us dollars up to a maximum of million canadian dollars  or approximately million 
the term loan accrues interest at our option at either the bank s prime rate plus or the bank s us dollar commercial loan rate plus 
as of march   the outstanding balance under the canadian revolving term loan was million canadian dollars  or approximately million 
we had million canadian dollars  or approximately million  available for future borrowings 
in december  our canadian subsidiary entered into an agreement with a canadian bank for an unsecured revolving line of credit facility in addition to the term loan 
the canadian credit facility expires on january  and replaced our previous canadian revolving line of credit facility  which would have expired on december  the canadian credit facility allows us to borrow canadian or us dollars up to a maximum of million canadian dollars  or approximately million 
for canadian dollar borrowings  the canadian credit facility accrues interest at the bank s prime rate or the bank s cost of funds plus an adjustment ranging from to depending on our financial performance 
for us dollar borrowings  the canadian credit facility accrues interest at the prime rate of the bank or a eurodollar rate plus an adjustment ranging from to depending on our financial performance 
as of march   the outstanding balance under the canadian revolving line of credit facility was million canadian dollars  or approximately million 
we had million canadian dollars  or approximately million  available for future borrowings 
during april  we refinanced the canadian revolving term loan and canadian revolving credit facility with a single credit facility of million canadian dollars  or approximately million  expiring during april availability under the credit facility is subject to certain borrowing base limitations  as defined 
for canadian dollar borrowings  the canadian credit facility accrues interest at the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
for us dollar borrowings  the canadian credit facility accrues interest at the bank s united states dollar base rate in new york plus basis points 
in december  our australian subsidiary entered into an agreement with an australian bank for an unsecured revolving line of credit facility allowing us to borrow australian dollars up to a maximum of million australian dollars  or approximately million 
the australian credit facility expires on january  and replaced our previous australian revolving line of credit facility  which would have expired on december  the australian credit facility accrues interest at the australian bill rate plus an adjustment ranging from to depending on our financial performance 
as of march   the outstanding balance under our australian credit facility was million australian dollars  or approximately million 
we had million australian dollars  or approximately million  available for future borrowings 
during june  we amended the australian credit facility to add another million australian dollars  or approximately million  to available credit for a total maximum credit availability of million australian dollars  or approximately million 
in the future  we may attempt to acquire other businesses to expand our existing computer and office supplies businesses in the united states or internationally  expand our product lines similar to our entry into the office supplies business and expand our services or capabilities in connection with our efforts to grow our business 
we currently have no binding agreements to acquire any material businesses 
however  at any time  we may have outstanding non binding letters of intent 
should we be successful in acquiring other businesses  we may require additional financing to consummate such a transaction 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties  therefore  we can give no assurance with respect to whether we will be successful in identifying such a business to acquire  whether we will be able to obtain financing to complete such an acquisition  or whether we will be successful in operating or integrating the acquired business 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital needs for the next twelve months  as well as business growth and planned capital expenditures  through funds available under our various line of credit facilities  trade credit  lease financing  internally generated funds and by increasing the amount available under our credit facilities 
further  depending on market conditions and the terms thereof  we may also consider obtaining additional funds through an additional line of credit  other debt financing or the sale of capital stock  however  no assurance can be given that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to daisytek or at all 
other matters inventory management daisytek manages its inventories held for sale in its core wholesale distribution business by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as we add new product lines and make large purchases from suppliers to take advantage of attractive terms 
to reduce the risk of loss due to supplier price reductions and slow moving inventory  we have entered into purchasing agreements with many of our suppliers  including most of our major suppliers  which contain price protection and stock return privileges under which we receive credits if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory or if we return slow moving inventory in exchange for other products 
seasonality although historically we have experienced our greatest sequential quarter revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter  management has not been able to determine the specific or  if any  seasonal factors that may cause quarterly variability in operating results 
management believes  however  that factors that may influence quarterly variability include the overall growth in the non paper computer supplies industry and shifts in demand for computer supplies products due to a variety of factors  including sales increases resulting from the introduction of new products 
we generally experience a relative slowness in sales during the summer months  which may adversely affect our first and second fiscal quarters in relation to sequential quarter performance 
inflation our management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 was adopted by daisytek effective april  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board has proposed new accounting for business combinations that  among other things  would change the accounting for goodwill recorded in business acquisitions as of the date of the new statement 
an important part of the proposed statement is that amortization of goodwill would cease for both assets acquired prior to the effective date of the statement and for any new goodwill acquired after the effective date of the statement 
rather than amortizing these assets  goodwill would be reviewed for impairment using a market value approach 
the proposed statement is expected to be issued in july as the amortization of the excess of cost over net assets acquired is a significant non cash expense that we currently recognize  this proposed statement  if finalized in its current form  could have a material impact on our financial statements 
risk factors risks related to our business we face competition from many sources that could adversely affect our business 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
minimal barriers to entry allow competitors to easily offer products and services that compete with those that we currently offer or anticipate offering 
our current and potential competitors include national  regional and specialty wholesalers of computer and office supplies  traditional retailers that sell or resell office products and business services  either through storefront locations or through the internet  where they can economically justify direct purchasing from manufacturers  large hardware wholesalers who sell supplies as an ancillary product line  and manufacturers wishing to sell direct to resellers or end users 
some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources available to them than we do 
we cannot assure you that we can continue to compete successfully against these or other competitors in the future 
in addition  increased competition in the business products industry  together with increased advertising  has heightened price awareness among end users 
this heightened price awareness has led to margin pressure on business products 
in the event that this trend continues  our profit margins could be adversely affected 
the loss of key suppliers and or shipping companies could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our suppliers to provide us with the products and services we need to serve our customers 
our agreements with our suppliers are generally terminable at any time or on short notice  with or without cause  and  while we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be good  we cannot assure you that any or all of our relationships will not be terminated or that such relationships will continue as presently in effect 
termination of such relationships or changes by our suppliers in their policies regarding wholesale distributors or volume discount schedules  other marketing programs applicable to us or product pricing generally may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we rely on strategic product shipping relationships to ship our products from our distribution centers to our customers 
loss of any of these relationships could reduce our ability to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis and material changes in delivery terms and pricing could adversely affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected by a systems or equipment failure 
our business depends upon the reliability of our systems and equipment  some of which is operated by third parties 
sustained or repeated system failures could significantly impair our ability to take orders  reduce the traffic on our website and may impair our reputation 
we may  from time to time  experience interruptions due to several factors including hardware failures  unsolicited bulk e mail and operating system failures 
if delays or interruptions continue to occur  our customers could perceive our network as being unreliable  traffic on our website could deteriorate  customers may become less inclined to purchase from us  and our brand could be adversely affected 
any failure on our part to minimize or prevent capacity constraints or system interruptions could have an adverse effect on our brand and our business 
furthermore  our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our distribution facilities  customer service centers  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage and failures 
damage or failures could result from fire  power loss  equipment malfunctions  system failures  natural disasters and other causes 
although we believe we have sufficient property and business interruption insurance  if our business is interrupted either from accidents or the intentional acts of others  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in the event of widespread damage or failures at our facilities  our short term disaster recovery and contingency plans and insurance coverage may not be sufficient 
our clients businesses may also be harmed from any system or equipment failures we experience 
in that event  our relationships with these clients may be adversely affected  we may lose these clients  our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to liability 
interruptions could also result from the intentional acts of others  like hackers 
if our systems are penetrated by computer hackers  or if computer viruses infect our systems  our computers could fail or proprietary information could be misappropriated 
if our clients suffer similar interruptions in their operations  for any of the reasons discussed above or for others  our business could also be adversely affected 
many of our customers and suppliers computer systems interface with our own 
if they suffer interruptions in their systems  the link to our systems could be severed and sales could be negatively impacted 
we depend on the continued operation of our distribution and fulfillment center in memphis  tennessee 
we conduct a significant amount of our distribution and fulfillment operations and our internet direct operations order processing and fulfillment functions from our facility in memphis  tennessee 
any disruption in the operations at our memphis distribution and fulfillment center for any reason  including due to damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events could cause us to be unable to fulfill internet direct orders 
this failure could cause us to lose customers  would harm our business and would lead to a decline in revenues 
additionally  we operate regional sales and distribution centers in toronto  ontario  vancouver  british columbia  mexico city and monterrey  mexico  sydney and perth  australia  and buenos aires  argentina 
to the extent we open additional distribution facilities in the future  we may face significant logistical and inventory management issues 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully manage these issues in the future or that we will be able to deal effectively with a disruption in the operation of our memphis facility 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in foreign countries  exposing us to additional risks in addition to those that exist in the united states 
a major component of our business strategy is to continue to expand internationally  and a significant portion of our operations is conducted in foreign countries 
for example  we operate regional sales and distribution centers in toronto  ontario  vancouver  british columbia  mexico city and monterrey  mexico  perth and sydney  australia  and buenos aires  argentina 
additionally  certain of our business supplies distributors operations are conducted in a distribution center operated by pfsweb in liege  belgium 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding into additional international markets 
in addition to the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenue from foreign operations and expand our international presence  there are risks inherent in doing business internationally  including changing regulatory requirements  legal uncertainty regarding foreign laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  political instability  potentially adverse tax consequences  foreign currency fluctuations  and cultural differences 
any one or more of these factors may materially adversely affect our business in a number of ways  such as increased costs  operational difficulties and reductions in revenue 
changing manufacturers prices and price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions could adversely impact our net sales  gross margins and net income 
we maintain substantial inventories to accommodate the prompt service and delivery requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we purchase our products on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices and market conditions 
although we have historically been able to pass through manufacturers price increases to our customers on a timely basis  competitive conditions will influence how much of future price increases can be passed on to our customers 
conversely  when manufacturers prices decline  lower sales prices could result in lower margins as we sell existing inventory 
changes in the prices paid by us for our products therefore could have a material adverse effect on our net sales  gross margins and net income  and the timing of such changes throughout the year could adversely impact quarterly results 
in addition  many of our office supply product offerings have been and are expected to continue to be subject to significant price fluctuations due to inflationary and other market conditions 
we are generally able to pass these increased costs on to our customers through price increases  although we may not be able to adjust our prices immediately 
significant increases in paper  fuel and other costs in the future could materially affect our profitability if these costs cannot be passed through to customers on a timely basis  if at all 
a breach of our e commerce security measures could reduce demand for our services 
we offer several products through our solonet service on our website and may offer additional products in the future 
advances in computer capabilities and new discoveries in the field of cryptography may compromise the security measures we use to protect our website  access to our databases  and transmissions to and from our website 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our operations 
any compromise or elimination of our security could reduce demand for our services 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to address any problem they may cause 
because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our existing stockholders  cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our business 
our growth strategy is dependent to a substantial degree on our ability to effect acquisitions 
some of our major competitors have similar acquisition strategies  and the office products distribution industry is consolidating rapidly 
as a result  there is substantial competition for suitable acquisition candidates in many markets 
we are continuously engaged in the pursuit of acquisitions and are currently in discussion with several acquisition candidates  both domestic and foreign 
future acquisitions by us could result in risks such as the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  our acquisition and integration costs may be higher than we anticipated and may cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate  we may experience difficulty and expense in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  disrupting our business and diverting management s time and attention  we may be unable to integrate or complete the development and application of acquired technology  we may experience difficulties in establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  our relationships with key customers of acquired businesses may be impaired due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  we may be unable to retain key employees of the acquired businesses  we may incur amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets  and our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for the acquisition with equity securities 
any of these factors could harm our operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire other computer and office products businesses on terms favorable to us 
our credit facilities impose restrictions with respect to various business matters 
our credit agreements contain numerous restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place significant restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to create liens or other encumbrances  to pay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock  to engage in transactions with affiliates  to make certain payments and investments and to merge or consolidate with another entity 
the credit agreements also contain a number of financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and tests 
a failure to comply with the obligations in the credit agreements could result in an event of default under the credit agreements  which  if not cured or waived  could permit acceleration of the indebtedness thereunder and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we have historically depended on pfsweb for various services 
we have historically been dependent on pfsweb for various services  including management information systems 
we have entered into a transition services agreement with pfsweb under which pfsweb will continue to provide certain of these services to us until november  when the term of this agreement expires  we will need either to extend the term of this agreement  engage other entities to perform these services or perform these services ourselves 
the cost of these services may be significantly higher if we purchase services from other parties or devote resources to handle these functions internally 
we have potential liability for certain of pfsweb s tax and credit obligations 
for all periods in which we owned or more of pfsweb s capital stock  pfsweb is included in our consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
if pfsweb or other members of the consolidated group fail to make any federal income tax payments  we would be liable for the shortfall since each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group s entire tax obligation 
in addition  in conjunction with the ipo  we have agreed to act as guarantor with respect to certain liabilities of pfsweb under certain of its operating leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for additional information 
our quarterly operating results may be subject to significant fluctuation 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of any of the following the mix of products and services sold  pricing actions of our competitors and us  pricing actions of our freight providers  pricing actions of manufacturers  seasonality  and charges associated with acquisitions and investments 
most of our operating expenses  such as rent expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and employee salaries  do not vary directly with the amount of our sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term 
as a result  if our sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter  we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter  and therefore any sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter 
we are dependent on our key personnel  and we need to hire and retain skilled personnel to sustain our business 
our performance is highly dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect our business 
we currently do not have employment agreements with our executive officers and key personnel 
in addition  we need to attract and retain other highly skilled technical and managerial personnel for whom there is intense competition 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the continuing growth of our business 
our inability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel would materially adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our business 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware corporate law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware general corporate law  as well as our share rights purchase plan and change in control agreements we have with various daisytek executives  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors  meaning that only approximately one third of our directors will be subject to re election at each annual stockholder meeting 
our certificate of incorporation also permits our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock which may have rights and preferences superior to those of the common stock 
the ability to issue preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us 
in addition  we have a share rights purchase plan pursuant to which preferred stock will be issued upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  including a change in control of daisytek defined as a person or group acquiring  or announcing a tender offer to acquire  or more of our common stock 
finally  our change in control agreements provide various benefits to our executives upon the occurrence of an acquisition or other change in control of daisytek 
these anti takeover measures could discourage takeover attempts and could materially adversely affect the price of our stock 
the price of our stock may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and announcements by us of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
in addition  stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
if our stock price proves to be volatile  we may be subject to securities class action litigation  which could result in substantial costs 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
in the future  we may be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could reduce our revenues or adversely affect our operating results 
risks related to our industry consolidation in the business products industry could adversely affect our business 
consolidation continues throughout all levels of the business products industry 
consolidation has resulted in a an increased ability of resellers and end users to buy goods directly from manufacturers on their own or through their participation in buying groups  b the ability of larger resellers who grow primarily through acquisitions to qualify for larger volume rebates than the acquired companies would have qualified for on a stand alone basis and c fewer independent resellers to purchase from wholesalers 
in addition  over the last decade  office products superstores which largely buy directly from manufacturers have entered virtually every major metropolitan market 
continuing consolidation could adversely affect our financial results 
our market is subject to rapid change and to compete we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our services and the underlying network infrastructure 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  client requirements or emerging industry standards  our business could be adversely affected 
we must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is subject to seasonality and end user demands may change rapidly 
although historically we have experienced our greatest sequential quarter revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter  our management has not been able to determine the specific or  if any  seasonal factors that may cause quarterly variability in operating results 
our management believes  however  that factors that may influence quarterly variability include the overall growth in the non paper computer supplies industry and shifts in demand for our computer supplies products due to a variety of factors  including sales increases resulting from the introduction of new products 
we generally experience a relative slowness in sales during the summer months  which may adversely affect our first and second fiscal quarter results in relation to sequential quarter performance 
any impact upon sales during this peak season could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the full year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
in addition  our sales and profitability are largely dependent on our ability to continually enhance our product offerings in order to meet changing end user demands 
end users traditional demands for business products have changed over the last several years as a result of  among other things  the widespread use of computers and other technological advances resulting in the reduction in use of traditional office supplies  efforts by various businesses to establish paperless work environments  increased recycling efforts and a trend toward non traditional offices such as home offices 
our ability to continually monitor and react to such trends and changes in end user demands will be necessary to avoid adverse effects on our sales and profitability 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if and to the extent that end user demand for a broad product selection or the need for overnight delivery were to diminish substantially or end user demand for a higher proportion of low margin products were to increase substantially 
we operate in an uncertain regulatory and legal environment 
new laws and regulations could harm our business 
our business is either subject to or may be affected by current and future governmental regulation in many different jurisdictions 
these rules  regulations  policies and procedures are constantly subject to change 
our business could suffer depending on the extent to which our activities are regulated or proposed to be regulated 
various jurisdictions already have enacted laws covering intellectual property  privacy and taxation that could affect our business 
if we become subject to claims that we have violated any laws  even if we successfully defend against these claims  our business could suffer 
moreover  new laws that impose restrictions on our ability to follow current business practices or increase our costs of doing business could hurt our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk daisytek is exposed to various market risks including interest rates on its debt and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business daisytek employs established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk is limited to our outstanding balances on our revolving lines of credit  which amounted to million at march  and million at march  to mitigate this risk  we converted million of our outstanding balance from variable interest to a fixed rate of for the three year life of our united states credit facility 
this interest rate swap has a fair value loss position of million at march  an basis point movement in interest rates would result in approximately  and  annualized increase or decrease in interest expense based on the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit at march  and  respectively 
we anticipate managing our future interest rate exposure by using a mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt and  if appropriate  financial derivative instruments 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rate movements typically also reflect economic growth  inflation  interest rates  government actions and other factors 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into us dollars may affect year over year comparability and could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal year and  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk related to net investment and intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts typically require the exchange of a foreign currency for us dollars at a fixed rate at a future date 
foreign currency instruments generally have maturities that do not exceed three months 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
a currency rate fluctuation of from year end rates would change the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts outstanding at march  and by million and million  respectively 
gains or losses on the foreign exchange contracts would be offset by gains or losses in our net position in the related international business
