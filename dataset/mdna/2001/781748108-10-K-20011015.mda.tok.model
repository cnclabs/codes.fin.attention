item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
introduction we derive our revenue primarily from fees charged for ambulance and fire protection services 
we provide ambulance services in response to emergency medical calls emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services general transport services to patients on both a fee for service basis and nonrefundable subscription fee basis 
per transport revenue depends on various factors  including the mix of rates between existing markets and new markets and the mix of activity between emergency ambulance services and non emergency transport services as well as other competitive factors 
fire protection services are provided either under contracts with municipalities  fire districts or other agencies or on a nonrefundable subscription fee basis to individual homeowners or commercial property owners 
domestic ambulance service fees are recorded net of medicare  medicaid and other reimbursement limitations and are recognized when services are provided 
payments received from third party payers represent a substantial portion of our ambulance service fee receipts 
we derived approximately of our net ambulance fee collections during and of our net ambulance fee collections during from such third party payers 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on credit risks applicable to certain types of payers  historical trends and other relevant information 
provision for doubtful accounts is made for the expected difference between ambulance services fees charged and amounts actually collected 
our provision for doubtful accounts generally is higher with respect to collections to be derived directly from patients than for collections to be derived from third party payers and generally is higher for emergency ambulance services than for general ambulance transport services 
because of the nature of our ambulance services  it is necessary to respond to a number of calls  primarily emergency ambulance service calls  which may not result in transports 
results of operations are discussed below on the basis of actual transports because transports are more directly related to revenue 
expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports are included in operating expenses 
the percentage of calls not resulting in transports varies substantially depending upon the mix of non emergency ambulance and emergency ambulance service calls in markets and is generally higher in service areas in which the calls are primarily emergency ambulance service calls 
rates in our markets take into account the anticipated number of calls that may not result in transports 
we do not separately account for expenses associated with calls that do not result in transports 
revenue generated under our capitated service arrangements in argentina is included in ambulance services revenue 
revenue generated under fire protection service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract 
subscription fees received in advance are deferred and recognized over the term of the subscription agreement  which is generally one year 
other revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from our public private alliance in san diego  fees associated with alternative transportation  dispatch  fleet  billing  and home health care services and is recognized when the services are provided 
other operating expenses consist primarily of rent and related occupancy expenses  vehicle and equipment maintenance and repairs  insurance  fuel and supplies  travel and professional fees 
we have pledged assets with a net book value of approximately million to secure certain of our obligations under our insurance and surety bonding program  including certain reimbursement obligations with respect to the workers compensation  performance bonds  appeal bonds and other aspects of such insurance and surety bonding program 
our net loss for the year ended june  was million or a loss of diluted per share 
this compares to a net loss of approximately million or per share diluted for the year ended june   and net income of million or per share diluted for the year ended june  the operating results for the year ended june  were adversely affected by the write off of impaired assets under sfas no 
 our operational restructuring program involving the closure of certain service areas  the loss of two exclusive contracts  the disposition of clinic operations in latin america  changes in estimates that impacted our reserves for workers compensation and general liability matters  and additional provision for doubtful accounts related to closed or closing service areas and non transport related receivables 
results of operations the following table sets forth the years ended june    and  certain items from our consolidated financial statements expressed as a percentage of total revenue years ended june  revenue ambulance services fire protection services other total revenue operating expenses payroll and employee benefits provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts change in accounting estimate depreciation amortization of intangibles other operating expenses asset impairment charges loss on disposition of clinic operations contract termination costs and related asset impairment restructuring charge and other operating income loss interest expense  net other income loss before income taxes  extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes net income loss before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
extraordinary loss cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue total revenue decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  ambulance services revenue decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  fire protection services revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  other revenue decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the decrease in ambulance services revenue is primarily related to decreased volume in our domestic ambulance service areas 
domestic ambulance service revenue decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the closure of certain underperforming service areas in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal additionally  there was a million approximate decrease related to the loss of a contract in lincoln  nebraska 
domestic ambulance services revenue in areas served by our company in both fiscal and decreased by or approximately million 
total domestic ambulance transports decreased by approximately  or  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  these decreases are a direct result of our efforts to reduce non emergency transports in certain areas and improve the quality of our revenue 
ambulance services revenue was further affected by a million approximate decrease in revenue in argentina related to decreases in memberships under capitated service arrangements due to the impact of the economic recession in argentina and a million approximate decrease in revenue generated from our former canadian operations 
fire protection services revenue increased approximately million due to new airport and industrial contracting activity  approximately million due to rate increases under existing fire protection contracts  approximately million due to forestry revenue increases and approximately million due to rate and utilization increases for fire protection services 
approximately million of the decrease in other revenue relates to decreases in revenue generated from alternative transportation services 
revenue generated from alternative transportation services has been a focus of our efforts to reduce transports in certain areas and improve the quality of our revenue 
additionally  approximately million of the decrease in other revenue is related to decreases in argentina medical clinic revenue 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in revenue related to our public private alliance with the city of san diego 
operating expenses payroll and employee benefit expenses decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the closure of certain underperforming service areas that were closed in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and approximately million of the decrease is related to the closure of our canadian operations 
payroll and employee benefit expenses for the fiscal year ended june  includes approximately million of additional workers compensation insurance expense related to increased claims experience  approximately million related to the accrual of paid time off for field personnel due to changes in paid time off policies from previous years and approximately million related to the accrual of incurred but not reported claims relating to health insurance as calculated by our third party administrator 
the remaining decrease reflects reductions in payroll and employee benefit expenses in existing service areas due to decreased transports as discussed above 
payroll and employee benefit expenses increased from approximately of total revenue during the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue during the year ended june  increased service utilization in our argentine operations also contributed to the increase in payroll and employee benefit expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
exclusive of the effect of the specific fiscal expenses identified earlier in this paragraph  we expect that payroll and employee benefit expenses will increase as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal during the year ended june  we recorded a million provision related to underperformance in collections on service areas closed during fiscal in addition  we recorded a million provision related to estimated underperformance in collections for service areas included in the fiscal restructuring 
it has been our experience that once a service area has been exited  it becomes more difficult to collect outstanding receivables 
as a result  management has now determined that any non transport receivable in excess of days outstanding will be reserved 
this adjustment totaled million at june  an additional million provision was also recorded in the fourth quarter for contractual transport receivables that were deemed uncollectible 
provision for doubtful accounts was approximately million for the year ended june  and approximately million for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts decreased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts  excluding a million provision taken in fiscal due to a change in method of estimation and a million provision taken in fiscal for doubtful accounts related to specific accounts deemed uncollectible in certain service areas being closed or downsized as part of our restructuring program  was approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts  excluding the million discussed above  was approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from approximately of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june   excluding the additional provisions discussed above 
net accounts receivable on non integrated collection systems currently represent of total net accounts receivable at june  we will continue to review the benefits and timing of integrating the remaining non integrated billing centers 
depreciation decreased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   primarily due to the disposal of certain assets related to closed operations as well as a decrease in capital expenditures during the current year 
depreciation decreased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  this decrease was the result of the write off of approximately million of goodwill in conjunction with the restructuring charges recorded in the year ended june  amortization was approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  and  respectively 
we anticipate that amortization expense and  to a lesser extent  depreciation expense will be reduced in fiscal as a result of the write off of impaired assets in fiscal other operating expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to additional general liability insurance reserves of million 
as explained more fully in the following paragraph  the accrual of approximately million related to a medicaid audit settlement and million related to the write off of amounts owed to us by a former owner 
these amounts are offset by a decrease of approximately million relating to closed service areas  as well as decreases in other operating expenses in existing service areas related to decreased transports 
other operating expenses increased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  effective january   we refined our methodology of determining reserves related to general liability claims 
the changing environment with respect to the rising cost of claims as well as the cost of litigation prompted a comprehensive review by management of detailed information from external advisors  historical settlement information and analysis of open claims which led to this change 
the new method more closely approximates the potential outcome of each open claim as well as the legal costs related to the administration of these claims 
additionally  reserves were set up to cover potential unknown claims based on historical occurrences of claims filed subsequent to the end of the policy year 
for financial reporting purposes  this change was treated as a change in accounting estimate 
we have experienced a substantial rise in the costs associated with both our insurance and surety bonding programs in comparison to prior years 
a significant factor is the overall hardening of the insurance  surety and re insurance markets  which has resulted in demands for larger premiums  collateralization of payment obligations and increasingly rigorous underwriting requirements 
our higher costs also result from our claims history and from vendors perception of our financial position due to our current debt structure and cash position  as well as the qualified opinion currently issued with respect to our audited financial statements 
sustained and substantial annual increases in premiums and requirements for collateral or pre funded deductible obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
total premium cost for insurance in fiscal was approximately million as compared to total premium cost of approximately million in fiscal we have been able to self fund these premium increases out of operating cash flow and have adjusted our budgetary assumptions to address anticipated future increases 
we have budgeted approximately million for projected total premium costs in fiscal management does not believe that we will experience increases in future years at similar incremental rates  however  external factors beyond our control  such as the condition of the current insurance market and the potential market impact of the terrorist attacks of september   may cause such increases 
medical  fleet  and fire supplies are maintained in a central warehouse  numerous regional warehouses  and multiple stations  lockers  and vehicles 
a physical inventory of all locations at june  revealed a shortage from recorded levels 
shrinkage  obsolescence  and supplies lost due to closures account for most of the shortage 
to reduce the recorded inventory to the actual physical count  an adjustment of approximately million was recorded as a component of other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  an estimated par level will be used for all non warehouse inventory 
the par level is based on the physical inventory counts taken at june   and will be adjusted based on periodic counts 
during the year ended june   we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately million 
in conjunction with our annual budgeting process  which included a thorough review of current and potential future collection rates  the allocation of significantly higher insurance costs and continuing wage increases  a review of the future estimated undiscounted cash flows indicated impairment of the assets of certain domestic and international operations 
approximately million million in domestic goodwill and million in argentina goodwill relates to the impairment of goodwill and approximately million relates to the impairment of fixed assets and other assets based on the criteria for impairment set forth in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
during the year ended june   we disposed of our clinic operations in argentina 
the operations were sold in exchange for a long term note 
the loss related to this disposition totaled approximately million 
during the year ended june   we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the loss of contracts in lincoln  nebraska and arlington  texas 
this charge included impairment of goodwill related to those operations of approximately million 
the remainder of the charge relates primarily to severance amounts incurred for employees of these operations 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million approximate restructuring charge related to the closure of certain service areas 
the components of the charge were approximately million write off of goodwill  million of lease termination costs  million of severance costs and million of other impaired assets and other costs 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million approximate restructuring charge related to the closure or downsizing of certain non emergency service areas and the reduction of corporate overhead 
the components of the charge were approximately million of severance costs  million of lease termination costs  million write off of goodwill  and million write off of other impaired assets and other costs 
interest expense increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  this increase was caused by higher than average debt balances during fiscal  fees  and additional interest incurred in conjunction with various waiver agreements 
our effective tax rate decreased from approximately for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance and other permanent differences  consisting of goodwill write offs and amortization 
the permanent differences and the valuation allowance result in a reduction of the tax benefits which could otherwise be available in a loss year  and thus a reduction in the effective tax rate 
a valuation allowance of approximately million has been provided because we believe that the realizability of the deferred tax asset does not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during the year ended june   we recorded an extraordinary loss on the expropriation of canadian ambulance service licenses of approximately million net of of income taxes 
we received approximately million from the ontario ministry of health as compensation for the loss of license and incurred costs and wrote off assets  mainly goodwill  totaling million 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a  approximate charge net of tax benefit of approximately  and was related to our expensing of previously capitalized organization costs in accordance with statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue total revenue increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  ambulance services revenue increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  domestic ambulance services revenue in areas served by our company in both fiscal and increased by approximately 
fire protection services revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  other revenue increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  total domestic ambulance transports decreased by approximately  or  from approximately  for the year ended june  to approximately  for the year ended june  due to our efforts to reduce non emergency transports in certain areas and improve the quality of our revenue 
the effect on revenue caused by the reduction in transports was more than offset by transports generated through new contracting activity as well as increases in average patient charges in other areas 
fire protection services revenue increased primarily due to revenue generated from new fire protection contracts awarded to us through competitive bidding as well as rate increases for fire protection services and greater utilization of our services under fee for service arrangements 
other revenue increased primarily due to revenue associated with urgent and primary care services provided in argentina by a company that we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in alternative transportation services revenue due to our efforts to reduce transports in certain areas and improve the quality of our revenue 
operating expenses payroll and employee benefit expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  payroll and employee benefit expenses for the fiscal year ended june  includes approximately million of additional health and workers compensation insurance expense due to a significant increase in the utilization of insurance benefits experienced during the closure of certain service areas as well as the development of certain existing claims 
payroll expense related to our new contracting activity during the fiscal year ended june  contributed approximately million to the increase  and the remainder was attributable to higher average labor costs in certain service areas 
we expect these higher average labor costs to continue in the future  including the increased costs associated with accounts receivable collection and with health care financing administration hcfa compliance 
payroll and employee benefit expenses increased from approximately of total revenue during the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue during the year ended june  increased service utilization in our argentine operations also contributed to the increase in payroll and employee benefit expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
because of the continuing difficulties encountered in the healthcare reimbursement environment  we accelerated our emphasis during fiscal on increasing the quality of our revenue in exiting service areas or substantially reducing service where it had become unprofitable to perform non emergency transports because of low reimbursement rates or a high risk of non reimbursement by payers 
we shifted the focus of our billing personnel to place greater emphasis on the billing process as opposed to the collection process 
we instituted mandatory comprehensive training for our paramedics and emergency medical technicians on new standards of documentation of ambulance run tickets 
we analyzed the various payer classes within our accounts receivable balance and the increasing costs to collect these receivables 
based on the increasingly unpredictable nature of healthcare accounts receivable and the increasing costs to collect those receivables  we concluded that the process changes had not brought about the benefits anticipated 
as a result  we changed our method of estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts effective october  under our new method of estimation  we have chosen to fully reserve our accounts receivable earlier in the collection cycle than had previously been our practice 
we provide specific allowances based upon the age of the accounts receivable within each payer class and also provide for general allowances based upon historic collection rates within each payer class 
payer classes include medicare  medicaid  and private pay 
accordingly  the effect of this change was an additional million provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal  which is stated separately in the accompanying financial statements 
we anticipate that this change will result in increases in our provision rate for doubtful accounts in future periods 
during fiscal  we continued to increase our focus on higher quality revenue by reducing the amount of non emergency ambulance transports in selected service areas and continued previously implemented initiatives to maximize the collection of our accounts receivable 
also  during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded a million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to specific accounts deemed uncollectible in certain service areas that are being closed or downsized as part of our restructuring program 
provision for doubtful accounts was approximately million for the year ended june  and approximately million for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts increased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  provision for doubtful accounts  using the new method of estimation but excluding the million additional provision due to the change in method of estimation and the million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to specific accounts deemed uncollectible in certain service areas that are being closed or downsized as part of our restructuring program  was approximately of the total revenue for the year ended june  and approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  the provision for doubtful accounts increased from approximately of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of domestic ambulance service revenue for the year ended june   excluding the additional provision of million described above and the million additional provision 
net accounts receivable on non integrated collection systems represented approximately of total net accounts receivable at june  depreciation increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   primarily due to increased property and equipment from recent new contracting activity 
depreciation increased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  this decrease was the result of the write off of approximately million of goodwill in conjunction with the restructuring charges recorded in the year ended june  amortization decreased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  other operating expenses increased approximately million  or  from million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  of the approximate million increase  approximately million was attributable to the accrual of proposed settlements relating to a medicare investigation and certain medicaid audits  approximately million was attributable to operations in services areas with newly acquired contracts  approximately million was attributable to the operation of a company that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  approximately million was attributable to additional insurance expense related primarily to general liability claims  approximately million was attributable to the write off of impaired assets  and approximately million was attributable to an increase in domestic fuel costs 
other operating expenses increased from approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  to approximately of total revenue for the year ended june  the increased service utilization in our argentine operations also contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
during the year ended june   we recorded a million approximate restructuring charge related to the closure or downsizing of certain non emergency service areas and the reduction of corporate overhead 
the components of the charge were approximately million of severance costs  million of lease termination costs  million write off of goodwill  and million write off of other impaired assets and other costs 
during the year ended june   we recorded a non recurring pre tax charge of approximately million for severance payments related to certain members of senior management who have left our company 
interest expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was caused by higher debt balances  fees  and additional interest incurred in conjunction with various waiver agreements and higher interest rates than historically incurred 
our effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to the impact of permanent differences  primarily consisting of goodwill write offs and amortization and a valuation allowance 
the permanent differences and the valuation allowance result in a reduction of the tax benefits which could otherwise be available in a loss year  and thus a reduction in the effective tax rate 
a valuation allowance of approximately million has been provided because the company believes that the realizability of the deferred tax asset does not meet the more likely than not criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during the year ended june   we recorded an extraordinary loss on the expropriation of canadian ambulance service licenses of approximately million net of of income taxes 
we received approximately million from the ontario ministry of health as compensation for the loss of license and incurred costs and wrote off assets  mainly goodwill  totaling approximately million 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted in a  approximate charge net of tax benefit of approximately  and was related to our expensing of previously capitalized organization costs in accordance with statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities

in the third quarter of the year ended june   we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million related to the closure or downsizing of certain non emergency service areas and the reduction of corporate overhead and approximately million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to uncollectible accounts in those service areas that are being closed or downsized 
in the fourth quarter of the year ended june   we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million related to the closure or downsizing of certain non emergency service areas and the reduction of corporate overhead and approximately million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to uncollectible accounts in those service areas that are being closed or downsized 
in the second quarter of the year ended june   we recorded million additional provision for doubtful accounts related to the underrealization of receivables in service areas closed in fiscal year we also recorded a million approximate charge related to the loss of an exclusive contract in lincoln nebraska 
in the third quarter of the year ended june   we recorded a million charge related to increased claims experience in workers compensation 
additionally we recorded a million charge related to changes in estimates impacting our reserves for general liability claims 
in the fourth quarter of the year ended june   we recorded approximately million provision for doubtful accounts  million of asset impairment charges  million related to the disposition of clinic operations in argentina  million of restructuring charges  a million charge related to the loss of an exclusive contract in arlington texas  million related to increased claim estimates on health insurance  million related to accrual of paid time off for field personnel  million related to inventory write offs  million related to medicaid audit  million related to write off of amounts due from former seller  million related to adjustments related to argentina  million of other asset write offs  and million related to a put by minority joint venture partner 
we have historically experienced  and expect to continue to experience  seasonality in quarterly operating results 
this seasonality has resulted from a number of factors  including relatively higher second and third fiscal quarter demand for transport services in our arizona and florida regions resulting from the greater winter populations in those regions 
also  our argentine operations experience greater utilization of services by customers under capitated service arrangements in the fourth quarter  as compared to the other three quarters  as south america enters into its winter season 
public health conditions affect our operations differently in different regions 
for example  greater utilization of services by customers under capitated service arrangements decrease our operating income 
the same conditions domestically  where we operate under fee for service arrangements  result in a greater number of transports  increasing our operating income 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operating activities  term and revolving indebtedness  capital equipment lease financing  issuance of senior notes  the sale of common stock through an initial public offering in july and subsequent public stock offerings in may and april  and the exercise of stock options 
during the year ended june   cash flow provided by operations was approximately million resulting primarily from net losses of approximately million  offset by non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of approximately million  provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million  and write offs of assets of approximately million 
additionally  we experienced an increase in accrued liabilities of approximately million and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately million 
cash flow used in operations was approximately million for the year ended june  cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   primarily due to repayments on the revolving credit facility and on other debt and capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  due primarily to capital expenditures of approximately million offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of approximately million and decreases in other assets of approximately million 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june   due in part to capital expenditures of approximately million 
our gross accounts receivable as of june  and june  were approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
our accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  were million and million as of such dates  respectively 
we believe that the decrease in net accounts receivable is due to many factors  including additional provision for doubtful accounts and overall improvement in collections on existing operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from approximately million at june  to approximately million at june  the primary reason for this decrease is the write off of uncollectible receivables offset by the current period provision for doubtful accounts 
as discussed above  we have instituted initiatives to improve our collection procedures  and we have changed our method of estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts effective in the second quarter of fiscal while management believes that we now have a more predictable method of determining the realizable value of our accounts receivable  based on continuing difficulties in the healthcare reimbursement environment  there can be no assurance that there will not be additional future write offs 
we have set aside operational cash flow into designated loss fund accounts  which cash is restricted to the payment of our deductible obligations as required under certain insurance policies 
in connection with our comprehensive general  automobile and professional policies  we have set aside million and budgeted for an additional  of cash deposits into the loss fund account to fund deductible payments related to fiscal policy year claims  approximately million of cash deposits into the loss fund account have been budgeted to fund deductible payments related to the fiscal policy year claims 
additionally  during fiscal  we will set aside approximately million of operational cash flow  in order to fund  in advance  our anticipated total deductible obligation for fiscal workers compensation claims 
under the terms of a joint venture agreement between a minority joint venture partner and us  the partner was entitled to put the minority interest to us on october  for a payment anticipated to be a net payment of approximately million 
we then had the option to delay the put for a period of one year 
the minority joint venture partner indicated his intention to exercise the put option and we indicated our intention to delay the put for a year 
we have commenced negotiations with the partner 
our liquidity and financial position may be materially adversely affected if the exercise of the put is valid and we are unable to negotiate satisfactory payment terms with the partner 
we have a million revolving credit facility  as amended  that matures march  the credit facility is unsecured and is unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our domestic wholly owned current and future subsidiaries 
interest rates and availability under the revolving credit facility depend on our meeting certain financial covenants  including total debt leverage ratios  total debt to capitalization ratios  and fixed charge ratios 
the revolving credit facility initially was priced at the greater of i prime rate  ii federal funds rate plus plus the applicable margin  or iii a libor based rate 
the libor based rates ranged from libor plus to libor plus 
as discussed below  during march  all borrowings became priced at prime rate plus 
at june   the weighted average interest rate was approximately on the revolving credit facility 
approximately million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility at june  we have received a compliance waiver  as amended  regarding the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit facility  which covers the periods from december  through december  the waiver  as amended  covers the representations and warranties related to no material adverse changes as well as the following financial covenants total debt leverage ratio  the total debt to total capitalization ratio  and the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the waiver  as amended  provides  among other things  that no additional borrowings will be available to us through the end of the waiver period  december  there is no assurance that we are in compliance with all of the technical conditions of the waiver  as amended 
as libor contracts expired in march  all borrowings were priced at prime rate plus percentage points and interest is payable monthly 
during the period covered by the waiver  as amended  we are accruing additional interest expense at a rate of per annum on the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility unless certain pay down requirements are met during that period 
we have recorded approximately million related to this additional interest expense through june   approximately million of which remains in accrued liabilities at june  also outstanding are million in letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility 
management believes that an amendment to the revolving credit facility could substantially alter the terms and conditions of the revolving credit facility  including potentially higher interest rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance that an amendment or restructuring of the revolving credit facility can be negotiated on satisfactory terms  or at all 
although we are not aware of any event of default under either the terms of the revolving credit facility as a result of the waiver agreement or our million senior notes due  and although there has been no acceleration of the repayment of the revolving credit facility or the senior notes due  the entire balance of these instruments has been reclassified as a current liability at june  in the accompanying financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor 
this reclassification  together with significant losses incurred in fiscal and  has resulted in our independent accountants modifying their fiscal year end audit report to include a statement that these uncertainties create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the existence of a going concern statement may make it more difficult to pursue additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
our inability to successfully negotiate an amendment to our revolving credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
including the classification of entire outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility as a current liability at june   we had a working capital deficiency of approximately million  including cash of approximately million  compared to a working capital deficiency of approximately million  including cash of approximately million  at june  in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that originally expired in november with a provision for the lending party to terminate the agreement in november the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we paid a fixed rate of and received a libor based floating rate 
the weighted average floating rate for the year ended june  was approximately 
as a result of this swap agreement interest expense was reduced by approximately  during the year ended june  in june  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement and received a termination fee of approximately  such amount was amortized as a reduction of interest expense on a straight line basis through november in february  we entered into a million capital equipment lease line of credit 
the lease line of credit matures at varying dates through july the lease line of credit is priced at the higher of libor plus or the commercial paper rate plus 
at june  the interest rate was on the lease line of credit 
approximately million was outstanding on this line of credit at june  in march  we issued million of senior notes due the notes under rule a under the securities act of  as amended securities act 
interest under the notes is payable semi annually on september and march  and the notes are not callable until march subject to the terms of the indenture 
we incurred expenses related to the offering of approximately million and will amortize these costs over the life of the notes 
we recorded a  discount on the notes and will amortize this discount over the life of the notes 
unamortized discount at june  was approximately  and this amount is recorded as an offset to the current portion of long term debt in the consolidated financial statements 
in april  we filed a registration statement under the securities act relating to an exchange offer for the notes 
the registration became effective on may  the notes are general unsecured obligations of our company and are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our domestic wholly owned current and future subsidiaries 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the notes contain certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur certain indebtedness  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or consolidations 
assuming that we receive continued waivers under our revolving credit facility of which there can be no assurance  we expect that cash flow from operations and our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our regularly scheduled debt service and our planned operating and capital needs for the twelve months subsequent to june  through our restructuring program we have closed or downsized several locations that were negatively impacting our cash flow 
in addition  we have significantly reduced our corporate overhead 
we have improved the quality of revenue and have experienced an upward trend in daily cash collections 
as noted above  we have received a series of waivers since february in relation to our noncompliance with financial covenants under our revolving credit facility 
we are currently operating under a waiver that will expire on december  we will not be in compliance with these financial covenants on december   and there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive waivers from our lenders 
if we fail to receive additional waivers from our lenders we will be in default under our revolving credit facility or the agreement for the senior notes or both 
a default under the senior notes or our revolving credit facility may  among other things  cause all amounts owed by us under such facilities to become due immediately upon such default 
any inability to obtain additional waivers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have been actively working with the lenders under our revolving credit facility during the term of the covenant waivers to structure a long term financing solution 
in connection with these efforts  we have retained an investment banking firm to assist us in evaluating available alternatives 
we believe our current business model and strategy can generate sufficient cash flow to provide a basis for a new long term agreement with our current lenders or to restructure our debt 
however  there can be no assurance we will sustain our targeted levels of operating cash flow or that we can accomplish an arrangement with regard to our debt on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any such arrangement may involve the conversion of all or a portion of our debt to equity or other similar transactions that could result in material and substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we issue equity securities in connection with any such arrangement  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be materially reduced  and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our current stockholders 
if we are unable to reach a long term agreement with our lenders  our business  operating results  financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern will be materially adversely affected 
during the year ended june   we made investments in companies offering ambulance services  ambulance billing services  and alternative transportation services 
we contributed cash  accounts receivable  and fixed assets totaling approximately million at june  to these businesses 
during the year ended june   one of these investments was determined to be impaired and amounts totaling million were written off 
these amounts represent the initial investment plus other amounts loaned to the company 
these investments have been recorded using the cost method of accounting 
effects of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been affected significantly by inflation or foreign currency fluctuations 
our revenue from international operations is denominated primarily in the currency of the country in which it is operating 
at june   our balance sheet reflects a  cumulative equity adjustment increase from foreign currency translation 
during the year ended june   we recognized a  translation adjustment as a component of the extraordinary loss on the expropriation of canadian ambulance service licenses 
although we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we continue to expand our international operations  exposure to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
see risk factors we face additional risks associated with our international operations contained in item of this report 
risk factors the following risk factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this report  should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business 
we have significant indebtedness 
we have significant indebtedness 
as of june   we have approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  consisting primarily of million of senior notes due in and approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility maturing march we currently are operating under a waiver relating to noncompliance with certain technical financial covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility 
we have complied with all payment obligations arising under our revolving credit facility and the senior notes 
our ability to service our debt depends on our future operating performance  which is affected by governmental regulations  the state of the economy  financial factors  and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient funds to enable us to make our periodic debt payments 
failure to make our periodic debt payments could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are operating under a temporary compliance waiver with respect to certain technical financial covenants under our revolving credit facility 
the agreement governing the terms of the senior notes contains certain covenants limiting our ability to incur certain additional debt create certain liens pay dividends issue guarantees redeem capital stock enter into transactions with affiliates make certain investments sell assets issue capital stock of subsidiaries complete certain mergers and consolidations the revolving credit facility contains other more restrictive covenants and requires us to satisfy certain financial tests  including a total debt leverage ratio  a total debt to total capitalization ratio  and a fixed charge ratio 
currently  we are not in compliance under our revolving credit facility with respect to certain technical financial covenants  including a total debt leverage ratio  a total debt to total capitalization ratio  and a fixed charge ratio 
our ability to satisfy those covenants can be affected by events both within and beyond our control  and we may be unable to meet these covenants 
we have received waivers of covenant compliance under our revolving credit facility covering periods from february through december   as we were not in compliance with the technical financial covenants as described above 
in accordance with the waiver  we are accruing an additional annual deferred interest on the amounts we owe under our revolving credit facility 
to date  we have paid approximately million in principal on our revolving credit facility in connection with the covenant waivers 
a breach of the waiver or any of the covenants or other terms of our debt could result in an event of default under the credit facility or the senior notes or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may not be in compliance with certain of the technical financial conditions of the waiver  however  the lenders have not asserted that we have failed to comply with any such requirements 
we may not continue to receive waivers of financial covenants from our lenders 
as noted above  we have received a series of waivers since february in relation to our noncompliance with certain technical financial covenants under our revolving credit facility 
we are currently operating under a waiver that will expire on december  we will not be in compliance with these financial covenants on december   and we may not continue to receive waivers from our lenders 
if we fail to receive additional waivers from our lenders we may be in default under our revolving credit facility or the agreement for the senior notes or both 
a default under the senior notes or our revolving credit facility may  among other things  cause all amounts owed by us under such facilities to become due immediately upon such default 
any inability to obtain additional waivers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
our independent public accountants have rendered a report that includes a going concern statement 
the senior notes and the credit facility have been reclassified as a current liability under accounting rules relating to debt that is callable by the creditor since we are operating under a waiver under our credit facility 
this  in addition to the significant operating losses incurred in fiscal and  as well as those items discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  have resulted in our independent public accountants modifying their report to include a statement that these uncertainties create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the existence of a going concern statement generally makes it more difficult to obtain trade credit  insurance and surety bonding  or additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings 
the going concern statement also may make it more difficult to maintain existing customer relationships and to initiate new customer relationships 
we may not be able to restructure our existing debt 
we have been actively working with the lenders under our revolving credit facility during the term of the covenant waivers to structure a long term financing solution 
in connection with these efforts  we have retained an investment banking firm to assist us in evaluating available alternatives 
we believe our current business model and strategy can generate sufficient cash flow to provide a basis for a new long term agreement with our current lenders or to restructure our debt 
however  we may be unable to sustain our targeted levels of operating cash flow  and we may be unable to accomplish an arrangement with regard to our debt on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are able to reach an arrangement with our lenders  the agreement may involve the conversion of all or a portion of our debt to equity or other similar transactions that could result in material and substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we issue equity securities in connection with any such arrangement  the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be materially reduced  and such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to our current stockholders 
if we are unable to reach a long term agreement with our lenders  our business  operating results  financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern will be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to sustain sufficient operating cash flow 
despite significant net losses in fiscal and  our restructuring efforts have enabled us to self fund our obligations since march from existing cash reserves and operating cash flow 
however  we may be unable to sustain our targeted levels of operating cash flow 
our ability to sustain our operating cash flow will depend upon various factors  including industry conditions  economic conditions  competitive conditions  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to sustain our targeted levels of operating cash flow  or in the event of an unanticipated cash requirement such as an adverse litigation outcome  reimbursement delays  or other matters we will need to pursue additional debt or equity financing 
any such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the terms of our waiver agreement currently restrict us from borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and the senior notes also restrict our ability to provide collateral to any prospective lender 
failure to maintain adequate operating cash flow will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and ability to continue as a going concern 
we operate through our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
to make our periodic debt payments  we must have access to the cash flow of our subsidiaries  whether through loans  dividends  distributions  or otherwise 
while our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities  we have always operated on a consolidated basis for cash management purposes 
in addition  substantially all of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior notes and the revolving credit facility 
nonetheless  our ability to make our debt payments could be subject to legal  contractual  and other restrictions that could hinder or prevent us from gaining access to the cash flow of our subsidiaries 
with respect to any obligation not specifically guaranteed by the subsidiaries  those separate and distinct legal entities have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts 
accordingly  the holders of any debt of our subsidiaries will be entitled to payment from the assets of such subsidiaries prior to the holders of any of our general  unsecured obligations 
as of june   our subsidiaries had million of debt in addition to their guarantees of the senior notes and the revolving credit facility 
we depend on reimbursements by third party payers and individuals 
we receive a substantial portion of our payments for ambulance services from third party payers  including medicare  medicaid  and private insurers 
we received approximately of our ambulance fee collections from such third party payers during fiscal  including approximately from medicare 
in fiscal  we received approximately of ambulance fee collections from these third parties  including approximately from medicare 
the reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays 
from time to time  we experience these delays 
third party payers are continuing their efforts to control expenditures for health care  including proposals to revise reimbursement policies 
we recognize revenue when we provide ambulance services  however  there can be lengthy delays before we receive payment 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  requests for reimbursement based on assertions that certain amounts are not reimbursable or additional supporting documentation is necessary 
retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third party payers 
we are subject to governmental audits of our medicare and medicaid reimbursement claims and may be required to repay these agencies if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed 
delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process adversely affect the level of accounts receivable  increase the overall costs of collection  and may adversely affect our working capital and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs 
we also face the continuing risk of non reimbursement to the extent that uninsured individuals require emergency ambulance service in service areas where an adequate subsidy is not provided 
amounts not covered by third party payers are the obligations of individual patients 
we may not receive whole or partial reimbursement from these uninsured individuals 
we continually review the mix of activity between emergency and general medical transport in view of the reimbursement environment and evaluate methods of recovering these amounts through the collection process 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on credit risk applicable to certain types of payers  historical trends  and other relevant information 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and may increase or decrease such allowances from time to time  including in those instances when we determine that the level of effort and cost of collection of certain accounts receivable is unacceptable 
the risks associated with third party payers and uninsured individuals and the inability to monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
our collection policies or our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable may not be adequate 
proposed rules may adversely affect our reimbursement rates of coverage 
during june  the health care financing administration issued proposed rules that would revise medicare policy on the coverage of ambulance services 
these proposed rules have been subject to public comment and  despite the passage of new laws addressing changes to the reimbursement of ambulance services by medicare as discussed below  have not yet been withdrawn 
the proposed rules have not been finalized 
in addition  the balanced budget act of became law in august this law in part provides for the development  negotiation  and implementation of prospective fee schedule for medicare reimbursement of ambulance services 
the new law also reduces the annual rate adjustment for medicare reimbursements from the consumer price index  or cpi  to cpi less one percentage point 
upon implementation  the new law will require that ambulance service providers accept assignment whereby we receive payment directly from medicare and accept such amount  along with the co pay and deductible paid by the patient  as payment in full 
the new law also stipulates that individual states may now elect not to provide payment for cost sharing for coinsurance  or copayments  for dual qualified medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
in january  hcfa cmms announced its intention to form a negotiated rule making committee to create a new fee schedule for medicare reimbursement of ambulance services 
the committee convened in february in august  hcfa cmms announced that the implementation of the prospective fee schedule as well as the mandatory acceptance of assignment would be postponed to january hcfa cmms also announced rules that became effective in february  which require  among other things  that a physician s certification be obtained for certain ambulance transports 
we have implemented a program to comply with these new rules 
the proposed medicare ambulance fee schedule and rule was published september  in the federal register  to be followed by a day comment period 
on november   hcfa cmms notified medicare carriers that it would not implement the proposed fee schedule and rules as scheduled on january  as of this filing  hcfa cmms has not established an implementation date for the final fee schedule and rules 
the final outcome of the proposed rules and the effect of the prospective fee schedule is uncertain 
however  changes in reimbursement policies  or other government action  together with the financial instability of private third party payers and budget pressures on payer sources could influence the timing and  potentially  the ultimate receipt of payments and reimbursements 
a reduction in coverage or reimbursement rates by third party payers  or an increase in our cost structure relative to the rate of increase in the cpi  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
certain state and local governments regulate rate structures and limit rates of return 
state or local government regulations or administrative policies regulate rate structures in most states in which we conduct ambulance operations 
in certain service areas in which we are the exclusive provider of services  the municipality or fire district sets the rates for emergency ambulance services pursuant to a master contract and establishes the rates for general ambulance services that we are permitted to charge 
rates in most service areas are set at the same amounts for emergency and general ambulance services 
for example  the state of arizona establishes a rate of return on sales we are permitted to earn in determining the ambulance service rates we may charge in that state 
ambulance services revenue generated in arizona accounted for approximately of total revenue for fiscal and approximately of total revenue for fiscal we may be unable to receive ambulance service rate increases on a timely basis where rates are regulated or to establish or maintain satisfactory rate structures where rates are not regulated 
municipalities and fire districts negotiate the payments to be made to us for fire protection services pursuant to master contracts 
these master contracts are based on a budget and on level of effort or performance criteria desired by the municipalities and fire districts 
we could be unsuccessful in negotiating or maintaining profitable contracts with municipalities and fire districts 
numerous governmental entities regulate our business numerous federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations govern various aspects of the business of ambulance service and fire fighting service providers  covering matters such as licensing  rates  employee certification  environmental matters  and other factors 
certificates of necessity may be required from state or local governments to operate ambulance services in a designated service area 
master contracts from governmental authorities are subject to risks of cancellation or unenforceability as a result of budgetary and other factors and may subject us to certain liabilities or restrictions that traditionally have applied only to governmental bodies 
federal  state  local  or foreign governments could change existing laws or regulations  adopt new laws or regulations that increase our cost of doing business  lower reimbursement levels  choose to provide services for themselves  or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we could encounter difficulty in complying with all applicable laws and regulations 
health care reforms and cost containment may affect our business 
numerous legislative proposals have been considered that would result in major reforms in the us health care system 
we cannot predict which  if any  health care reforms may be proposed or enacted or the effect that any such legislation would have on our business 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which protects the privacy of patients health information handled by health care providers and establishes standards for its electronic transmission  was enacted on august  the final rule  which took effect on april   requires covered entities to comply with the final rule s provisions by april   and covers all individually identifiable health information used or disclosed by a covered entity 
our corporate compliance committee has formed a hipaa subcommittee to address the impact of hipaa and to consider changes to or enactment of policies and or procedures which may need to be implemented to comply under the final rule 
because the impact of hipaa on the health care industry is not known at this time  we may incur significant costs associated with implementation and continued compliance with hipaa or further legislation which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
in addition  managed care providers are focusing on cost containment measures while seeking to provide the most appropriate level of service at the most appropriate treatment facility 
changing industry practices could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
claims against us could exceed our insurance coverage 
we have experienced material increases in the cost of our insurance coverage 
we are subject to a significant number of accident  injury and malpractice claims as a result of the nature of our business and the day to day operation of our vehicle fleet 
the coverage limits of our policies may not be adequate 
in addition  we may experience claims within our deductibles and self insured retentions in amounts greater than expected 
such increased costs and potential liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or outcome  also may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business 
in fiscal and  we experienced significant increases in the premiums we have had to pay  and in the collateral or other advance funding required 
we also have increased our deductible and self insurance retentions under several coverages 
many counties  municipalities  and fire districts also require us to provide a surety bond or other assurance of financial and performance responsibility  and the cost and collateral requirements associated with obtaining such bonds have increased 
sustained and substantial annual increases in premiums and requirements for collateral and or restricted funds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  and results of operations 
we may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
on july   the nasdaq stock market notified us that we were not in compliance with a nasdaq smallcap maintenance standard 
this standard requires that we maintain at least a minimum bid price 
under the nasdaq notice  we had until october  to comply with the maintenance requirement 
in order to comply  our common stock had to trade above for at least ten consecutive trading days prior to such date 
on september   nasdaq announced  effective immediately  it was implementing an across the board moratorium on the minimum bid and public float requirements for continued listing on nasdaq 
in particular  companies currently under review for failure to maintain such requirements  as we are  have been removed from the compliance process with respect to the bid price and public float requirements 
the suspension of these requirements will remain effective until january   and no deficiencies will accrue during the suspension period 
on such date nasdaq reinstates these requirements  which currently is january   we will again become subject to such requirements 
in addition  if our time period to comply is tolled during nasdaq s suspension period and not reset  we will have approximately days from such date to comply with the requirement that our common stock trade above for at least consecutive trading days 
as of september   our common stock has not traded in excess of on any day since the date we received notice from nasdaq 
in addition  we must continue to meet other maintenance requirements including either stockholders equity  market capitalization or net income 
nasdaq has amended the old net tangible asset test and replaced it with a stockholders equity test 
companies will have until november to achieve compliance with the stockholders equity test if that is the alternative maintenance standard with which they are complying 
if we do not satisfy the maintenance requirements  we may decide to appeal the decision by nasdaq to delist our common stock  or we may decide to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board or any other organized market on which our shares may be eligible for trading 
as a result of delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market  investors would have significantly less liquidity  limited availability of quotations  and more difficulty purchasing and selling our common stock  even if our common stock continues to trade on the otc bulletin board 
further  delisting could reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we depend on certain business relationships 
we depend to a great extent on certain contracts with municipalities or fire districts to provide emergency ambulance services and fire protection services 
our six largest contracts accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  one of these contracts accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended contracts with municipalities or fire districts may have certain budgetary approval constraints 
failure to allocate funds for a contract may adversely affect our ability to continue to perform services without suffering significant losses 
the loss or cancellation of several of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  and results of operations 
we may not be successful in retaining our existing contracts or in obtaining new contracts for emergency ambulance services or for fire protection services 
our contracts with municipalities and fire districts and with managed care organizations and health care providers are short term or open ended or for periods ranging from two years to five years 
during such periods  we may determine that a contract is no longer favorable and may seek to modify or terminate the contract 
when making such a determination  we may consider factors  such as weaker than expected transport volume  geographical issues adversely affecting response times  and delays in implementing technology upgrades 
we face certain risks in attempting to terminate unfavorable contracts prior to their expiration because of the possibility of forfeiting performance bonds and the potential adverse political and public relations consequences 
our inability to terminate or amend unfavorable contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
we also face the risk that areas in which we provide fire protection services through subscription arrangements with residents and businesses will be converted to tax supported fire districts or annexed by municipalities 
we face risks associated with our prior rapid growth  integration  and acquisitions 
we must integrate and successfully operate the ambulance service providers that we have acquired 
the process of integrating management  operations  facilities  and accounting and billing and collection systems and other information systems requires continued investment of time and resources and can involve difficulties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
unforeseen liabilities and other issues also could arise in connection with the operation of businesses that we have previously acquired or may acquire in the future 
our acquisition agreements contain purchase price adjustments  rights of set off  indemnification  and other remedies in the event that certain unforeseen liabilities or issues arise in connection with an acquisition 
however  these purchase price adjustments  rights of set off  indemnification  and other remedies expire and may not be sufficient to compensate us in the event that any liabilities or other issues arise 
we face additional risks associated with our international operations 
we currently maintain operations in latin america  with ambulance and healthcare services provided in argentina  as well as aircraft rescue and fire fighting services to several airports in bolivia 
in addition to other business risks discussed herein  we are subject to various risks associated with international operations  including the following management of a multi national organization  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  compliance with local laws and other regulatory requirements and changes in such laws and requirements  restrictions on the repatriation of funds  inflationary conditions  employment and severance issues  political and economic instability  including economic recessions  war or other hostilities  expropriation or nationalization of assets  overlap of tax structures and imposition of new taxes  and renegotiation or nullification of contracts 
the inability to effectively manage these and other risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
certain of our international customers receive services under capitated service arrangements 
during periods of high utilization  as we have experienced in argentina particularly during the winter months  our operations experience greater utilization of services under these capitated service arrangements 
during these periods  our operations incur increased expenses without a corresponding increase in revenue 
our revenue from international operations is denominated primarily in the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
a decrease in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in losses from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
in the future  we may seek to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
any currency exchange strategy may be unsuccessful in avoiding exchange related losses  and the failure to manage currency risks effectively may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
in addition  revenue we earn in foreign countries may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting our earnings 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
the ambulance service industry is highly competitive 
ambulance and general transport service providers compete primarily on the basis of quality of service  performance  and cost 
in order to compete successfully  we must make continuing investments in our fleet  facilities  and operating systems 
we believe that counties  fire districts  and municipalities consider the following factors in awarding a contract quality of medical care  historical response time performance  customer service  financial stability  and personnel policies and practices 
we currently compete with the following entities to provide ambulance services governmental entities including fire districts  hospitals  other national ambulance service providers  large regional ambulance service providers  and local and volunteer private providers 
municipalities  fire districts  and health care organizations that currently contract for ambulance services could choose to provide ambulance services directly in the future 
we are experiencing increased competition from fire departments in providing emergency ambulance service 
some of our current competitors and certain potential competitors have or have access to greater capital and other resources than us 
tax supported fire districts  municipal fire departments  and volunteer fire departments represent the principal providers of fire protection services for residential and commercial properties 
private providers represent only a small portion of the total fire protection market and generally provide services where a tax supported municipality or fire district has decided to contract for these services or has not assumed the financial responsibility for fire protection 
in these situations  we provide services for a municipality or fire district on a contract basis or provide fire protection services directly to residences and businesses who subscribe for this service 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able continue to maintain current contracts or subscription or to obtain additional fire protection business on a contractual or subscription basis  fire districts or municipalities will not choose to provide fire protection services directly in the future  or areas in which we provide services through subscriptions will not be converted to tax supported fire districts or annexed by municipalities 
we depend on our management and other key personnel 
our success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
we could experience difficulty in retaining our current key personnel or in attracting and retaining necessary additional key personnel 
low unemployment in certain market areas currently makes the recruiting  training  and retention of full time and part time personnel more difficult and costly  including the cost of overtime wages 
our internal growth will further increase the demand on our resources and require the addition of new personnel 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and certain other key personnel 
failure to retain or replace our key personnel may have an adverse effect on our business 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  shareholders rights plan and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control might be beneficial to stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we face increased interest expenses associated with interest rate under certain debt 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to limit the effect of increases in the interest rates on our floating rate debt 
the swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
the notional amounts of interest rate agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the net cash amounts paid or received on the agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that originally expired in november with a provision for the lending party to terminate the agreement in november the interest rate swap agreement effectively converted million of variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
we paid a fixed rate of and received a libor based floating rate 
the weighted average floating rate for the year ended june  was 
as a result of this swap agreement interest expense was reduced by approximately  during the year ended june  in june  we terminated the interest rate swap agreement and received a termination fee of  such amount was amortized as a reduction of interest expense on a straight line basis through november
