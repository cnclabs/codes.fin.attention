item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of atp and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
on may   atp acquired all of the capital stock of brigantine sa  a manufacturer of honeycomb products and engineered panels located in france 
the acquired company  renamed alcore brigantine sa  operates as a subsidiary of alcore  inc  which is a subsidiary of the company 
the alcore and alcore brigantine sa operations are accounted for as a discontinued operation of the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the operating results for alcore brigantine sa since the date of the acquisition 
historically  approximately to of atp s products and services have been sold to the united states government through prime contracts directly with governmental agencies  primarily the dod  or through subcontracts with other governmental contractors 
during the mid s  the defense industry began to be negatively impacted by a perceived reduction of threats from the former soviet union and affiliated countries in eastern europe 
in addition  increased competition for the united states federal budget dollars resulted in a reduction in real dollars in the united states defense budget over the last decade 
defense spending has recently begun to stabilize in the united states  and management of atp believes that budgeted procurement spending will increase slightly over the next few years 
the contraction of the united states defense budget over the last decade and the resulting excess capacity and intensified competition among defense contractors has resulted in significant industry consolidation 
atp s strategy includes the pursuit of acquisitions which will increase its revenue base and improve its cost competitiveness through reduced overhead costs  facility consolidations and the elimination of other duplicative costs 
however  because of the uncertainty of the nature and size of these opportunities  as well as atp s financial leverage  there can be no assurances that the financing necessary to pay for acquisitions can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
although the long term impact of industry consolidation and the defense spending budget cannot be predicted with certainty  management of atp believes that it is positioned to increase its presence in the united states defense industry and increase its ongoing diversification efforts into foreign defense markets and selected commercial markets 
the united states government s fiscal year begins on october  and contracts and options on contracts are generally awarded just prior to its year end 
atp s experience indicates that the lead time to perform the necessary design work  procure material and begin production is generally several months  and this can create a period of low production  revenue and profits in the first half of each fiscal year of atp 
over the last five years  the percentage of sales and operating earnings excluding corporate general and administrative expenses generated in the second half of the year have been as follows earnings before year sales interest taxes all years included are based on results of continuing operations restatement of previously reported financial statements during january  the company learned of possible accounting and financial reporting irregularities at its subsidiary  alcore  when certain financial records were seized in connection with a search warrant issued by the united states district court district of maryland as part of a governmental investigation 
additionally  the company has been notified of an investigation by the united states securities and exchange commission regarding these matters 
after becoming aware of the possible irregularities  the company engaged special counsel and forensic accountants to assist in its investigation of the possible irregularities 
as a result  the company has previously restated its consolidated financial statements including its quarterly financial statements for the first  second and third quarters of 
substantially all of the adjustments to restate the financial statements relate to operations which have been subsequently classified as discontinued by the company and are contained in the restated results of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion of amounts relates to the company s results of operations as restated for the adjustments determined necessary by the company s investigation 
discontinued operations on june   the company adopted a formal plan to sell its structural core materials segment  which consists of the operations of the alcore and alcore brigantine sa subsidiaries 
during march  the company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent for the sale of certain assets of alcore and of the stock of the alcore brigantine sa subsidiary the transaction 
consummation of the transaction is subject to  among other things  satisfactory completion of due diligence by the purchaser  execution and delivery of a definitive purchase agreement and certain third party approvals 
the company anticipates the transaction will be closed during the second quarter of the following discussion relates to the company s results of operations as restated to account for the structural core materials segment as a discontinued operation for all years reported 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues 
net revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other expense income before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues increased million  or from million in to million in positive revenue variations in compared to include i increased deliveries of composite components on several long term aerospace and defense programs  including the f e f and c military aircraft and the airbus a and a commercial aircraft  ii increased shipments of the company s commercial composites products and iii increased revenues on chemical defense contracts  primarily from the micad program 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to increased sales of the commercial composites business segment and cost efficiencies associated with increased sales from the other product lines 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses include non recurring charges of million recorded in the second quarter of  including costs incurred in connection with the termination of a january merger agreement and severance costs 
excluding the non recurring charges  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased from in to in  the result of higher revenues and reduced general and administrative spending 
operating income was million  or of revenues  in  compared to million  or of revenues  in excluding the non recurring general and administrative costs of million discussed in the previous paragraph  operating income was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to the increase in operating income results primarily from increased revenues  improved operating results of the commercial composites segment and increased profits on advanced composite components delivered on certain aerospace and defense programs 
interest expense in increased  or  primarily the result of an increase in average loan balances outstanding and an increase in average interest rates during compared to income tax expense was million in compared to million in the increase results from higher income before taxes as the effective income tax rate was for both years 
total loss from discontinued operations increased by million  from million in to million in the loss includes an after tax provision of million for the estimated loss on disposal of the discontinued structural core material business segment 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues increased million  or from million in to million in the increase in revenues in was primarily attributable to the following factors i increased revenues on chemical defense contracts  including two large contracts which were in the design or start up phase during most of and were in full production during all of  ii increased deliveries of composite components on several long term aerospace defense programs  including the c and f e f military aircraft and iii increased shipments of the company s commercial products  including specialty vehicle electronics and ngv fuel tanks 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in shipments on shelter contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to for the comparable period in an increase in the gross profit rate on revenues of the company s commercial composites business segment were nearly offset by a decrease in profit rates on revenues of the aerospace and defense business segment 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase reflects i higher corporate expense primarily resulting from nonrecurring costs incurred in connection with a proposed merger of the company and ii a general increase in business activity 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in operating income was million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to the increased sales volume 
operating income as a percentage of revenues was for both and interest expense in increased  primarily the result of an increase in average loan balances outstanding and an increase in average interest rates during compared to income tax expense was million in compared to million in the increase results from higher income before taxes as the effective income tax rate was for both years 
total loss from discontinued operations increased by million  from million in to million in the discontinued operations results reflect losses incurred at alcore primarily the result of i production inefficiencies experienced in the moving of certain operations to a new leased facility  including abnormally high production scrap rates and increased costs for machinery and equipment re arrangement and set up  ii lower sales prices caused by intensified competition in the commercial aerospace industry and iii a write off of excess and obsolete inventories and capital equipment 
financial condition and liquidity cash flow used in operations was  in compared to million of cash flow provided by operations in working capital  excluding short term debt balances  increased million in to million 
this increase was the result of i an increase of million in accounts receivable  resulting primarily from higher sales volume in the last quarter of compared to and an increase in the percentage of revenues generated by commercial customers which  in general have a tendency to be slower paying than the company s aerospace and defense customers  ii an increase of million in inventory  reflecting generally higher business activity levels  iii an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents  primarily the result of  of collateral payments made during in connection with a letter of credit agreement between the company and a bank and iv a net decrease in other working capital components of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  and resulted exclusively from capital expenditures 
on october   the company entered into a new financing agreement with its primary lender 
at december   the company s credit facility with this lending institution totaled million consisting of million of revolving credit against eligible receivable and inventory balances  a million term loan and a million capital equipment loan 
as of december   the company had approximately million of unused borrowing availability on this credit facility  net of million of reserves against the revolving loan borrowing base for outstanding stand by letters of credit commitments and other items 
the term loan is payable quarterly based on a seven year amortization period 
equipment loan principal payments are made monthly based on a five year amortization period 
the interest rates on the loans are set quarterly based on the company s performance against debt to earnings ratios specified in the agreement 
interest rates can range from libor the london interbank offered rates plus to libor plus on the revolving loan and from libor plus to libor plus on the term and equipment loans 
alternatively  the company may elect interest rates based on the lending institution s prime rate with the revolving loan ranging from prime plus to prime plus and the term and equipment loans ranging from prime plus to prime plus 
interest is paid monthly in arrears on all loans 
the credit facility matures on october  the company is subject to several financial and nonfinancial covenants under the million credit facility 
at december   the company was in violation of certain financial covenants 
such violations were cured as a result of an amendment to the agreement dated march  during october  the company entered into an agreement with a lender for a three year   loan in the form of a junior secured credit facility 
the loan bears interest payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate of  and an additional of payment in kind interest that is payable at maturity 
the loan matures in october in connection with the loan  atp also issued warrants giving the lender the right to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time prior to the fifth anniversary of the credit facility closing 
alternatively  at any time after months from the closing  but prior to the expiration of the warrants  the lender may elect to require the company to repurchase each warrant for an amount equal to of atp s ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization divided by  put option 
the put option is subject to a maximum cap of  in the event of an exercise of the put option resulting in a repurchase price of  or greater  the company has the right to satisfy up to of the obligation by issuing a promissory note to the lender  with principal payments amortized evenly over months 
the company is subject to several financial and nonfinancial covenants under the loan agreement 
at december   the company was in violation of certain financial covenants 
such violations were cured as a result of an amendment to the agreement dated april  at december   the company s backlog of orders and long term contracts was approximately million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the backlog includes firm released orders of approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
approximately of the company s firm released backlog at december  is expected to be delivered in as discussed above  the company has made capital expenditures totaling million during  which have been financed by increased borrowings under the revolving loan portion of the company s credit facility 
the company invested approximately million in capital equipment and facility improvements during the two year period ending december  these investments were made primarily in support of several new long term aerospace and defense contracts that are now in full production  and facility and equipment upgrades relating to ngv tank production 
as a result  management believes that future short term capital spending requirements will be limited to a normal sustaining maintenance level plus a relatively low amount of expenditures that will be cost justified by anticipated incremental program revenues 
however  the company will consider other future capital expenditure investments beyond the maintenance level when such investments are deemed to be strategic or critical to the company s growth 
the company also anticipates its plan to sell its structural core materials segment will generate additional future cash proceeds 
the company presently anticipates disposal of the segment during the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
management of atp believes that cash flows from operations  available borrowings under its current credit facility and the additional subordinated financing obtained during october are adequate to sustain the company s current operating level and expected growth for the next one to three years 
however  should circumstances arise affecting cash flow or requiring capital expenditures beyond those anticipated by the company  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are those that do not state historical facts and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
some of such risks and uncertainties are described below 
dependence on principal industries 
the revenues of atp are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industries 
sales to non aerospace and non defense industries  although growing  are anticipated to approximate to of total revenues of atp for the foreseeable future 
atp s success will be heavily dependent on its ability to successfully obtain major new defense orders currently planned to be released by the united states government and government prime contractors  as well as the continued strength of the aerospace industry  particularly the commercial aircraft industry 
no assurances can be given that atp will be able to successfully obtain all or even a major portion of the targeted defense industry orders anticipated to be placed 
the commercial aerospace industry is a cyclical business  and the demand by commercial airlines for new aircraft is highly dependent upon a variety of factors  which historically have been related to the stability and health of the united states and world economies 
risks of reductions or changes in military expenditures 
the primary customers of atp are agencies of the dod 
sales under contracts with the dod or under subcontracts that identify the dod as the ultimate purchaser represented approximately of atp s revenues 
the united states defense budget has declined in real terms since the mid s  resulting in some delays in new program starts  program stretch outs and program cancellations 
the united states defense budget has begun to stabilize and even increased in real dollars over the last several years 
a major portion of atp s dod business is expected to be funded by the procurement and research  development  test and evaluation segments of the defense budget 
procurement and research  development  test and evaluation funding has been significantly reduced over the last decade but is expected to remain relatively stable or grow slightly over the next decade 
a significant portion of atp s dod business is also expected to be funded by the operations and maintenance portion of the dod budget  which has declined less than the other segments 
a further significant decline or reallocation of the procurement  research  development  test and evaluation or operations and maintenance segments of the dod budget could materially and adversely affect atp s sales and earnings 
the loss or significant curtailment of atp s material united states defense contracts would also materially and adversely affect atp s future sales and earnings 
competition 
the market for atp s products is highly competitive 
atp competes with numerous competitors  a number of which possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources 
continued consolidation of major aerospace companies could result in program cancellations as well as increased demand for price concessions 
this  together with increased competition for available business  could translate into downward pressure on gross margins with resulting lower overall profit margins 
vendor prices for production materials such as resins  liquid and film adhesives  reinforcing fiber materials and other materials and supplies could increase as demand for aircraft parts and assemblies increase to match higher build rates for commercial and military aircraft 
higher material prices and demand for lower aircraft part and assembly prices could place increasing pressure on atp s operating margins and net income 
although management of atp believes that the company is well positioned to maintain or improve its place among its competitors  there can be no assurance that atp will be able to compete successfully in the future 
financial leverage 
atp has a significant amount of indebtedness  which could make it difficult to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes 
moreover  the terms of atp s indebtedness impose various restrictions and covenants on atp which could potentially limit atp s ability to respond to market conditions or to take advantage of business opportunities 
atp s ability to meet its debt service obligations and to reduce total debt will be dependent upon its future performance  which  in turn  will be subject to general conditions in the aerospace and defense industries and to financial  business and other factors affecting the operations of atp  many of which will be beyond its control 
other factors 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of its operations in the periods covered by this report 
year issues atp completed its year yk preparation plan which included the following steps assessment  modification implementation and testing 
the company has not experienced any significant malfunctions or errors in its internal information technology it and non it systems that are critical to its operations since january  a few minor application problems were identified and resolved early in the year the company is not aware of any significant yk issues or problems that may have arisen for its significant customers and suppliers 
based on currently available information  the company is not aware of any significant continued exposure to yk systems issues 
atp s yk costs have not been budgeted and tracked as independent projects  but have been incurred in conjunction with normal sustaining activities 
atp estimates that such costs  including the replacement or upgrading of outdated  noncompliant hardware and software were less than  recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  is effective for the company beginning january the new statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes accounting treatment for three types of hedges hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments  hedges of the variable cash flows of forecasted transactions  and hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations 
the company does not anticipate there will be a material impact on the results of operations or financial position upon adoption of this standard 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements 
among other things  eitf issue no 
provides additional guidance on how entities should account for costs incurred to design and develop molds  dies  and tooling that will be used to produce products that will be sold under long term supply arrangements 
the company adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
on january  as a result  there was no material impact on the results of operations for any periods reported 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which clarifies certain conditions to be met in order to recognize revenue 
the adoption of guidelines contained in staff accounting bulletin no 
did not materially impact the results of operations for any periods reported 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily relating to its million credit facility 
however  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility generally approximate fair value due to the variable rate nature of such borrowings 
the interest rates are set quarterly based on the company s performance against debt to earnings ratios specified in the agreement 
interest rates can range from libor plus to libor plus on the revolving loan and from libor plus to libor plus on the term and equipment loans 
alternatively  the company may elect interest rates based on the lending institution s prime rate with the revolving loan ranging from prime plus to prime plus and the term and equipment loans ranging from prime plus to prime plus 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  the company has million of bonds payable at december  for which it has entered an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution to fix the interest rate at through the year the company has not entered into transactions which subject it to material foreign currency transaction gains and losses
