introduction the company s revenues and income from operations are derived principally from the operations of its telephone subsidiary  gt t 
gt t derives almost all of its revenues from international telephone services

in july  the company acquired a interest  increased to in  in bermuda digital communications  ltd  a bermuda corporation which operates under the name cellular one and is the sole cellular and pcs competitor in bermuda to the bermuda telephone company 
during  the company organized a wholly owned subsidiary  wireless world  llc  and wireless world  llc

antilles wireless held lmds and mmds licenses for the us virgin islands and provided wireless cable tv services there 
effective june   wireless world acquired the islands 
vi internet access business of cobex international inc  an internet service provider in the us virgin islands 
the acquisition added approximately subscribers to wireless world s customer base 
atlantic tele center  inc atc a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  is currently developing a web enabled outsourcing call center in guyana to provide customer support to companies serving the usand other markets 
the company has signed advisory fee contracts with bermuda digital communications ltd 
and each of its operating subsidiaries compensating it at of gross revenues for management services provided 
the assets  liabilities  and operations of atn haiti sa  bermuda digital communications  ltd  wireless world  llc  antilles wireless cable tv company and atc  individually and in the aggregate  are not currently material to the assets  liabilities  and operations of the company on a consolidated basis 
the principal components of operating expenses for the company s telephone operations are plant specific operations expenses  plant non specific operations expenses  customer operations expenses  corporate operations expenses  international long distance expenses  taxes other than income taxes and general and administrative expenses 
these categories are consistent with fcc accounting practices 
plant specific operations expenses relate to support and maintenance of telephone plant and equipment and include vehicle expense  land and building expense  central office switching expense and cable and wire expense 
plant non specific operations expenses consist of depreciation charges for telephone plant and equipment and expenses related to telephone plant and network administration  engineering  power  materials and supplies  provisioning and plant network testing 
customer operations expenses relate to marketing  providing operator services for call completion and directory assistance  and establishing and servicing customer accounts 
corporate operations expenses include gt t s expenses for executive management and administration  corporate planning  accounting and finance  external relations  personnel  labor relations  data processing  legal services  procurement and general insurance 
international long distance expenses consist principally of charges from international carriers for outbound international calls from guyana and payments to audiotext providers from whom gt t derives international audiotext traffic 
taxes other than income taxes include gross receipts taxes  property taxes  and other miscellaneous taxes 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of parent company overheads and amortization 
for accounting purposes  the december split up transaction of the company into two separate publicly held companies the company and the emerging communications  inc was treated as a non pro rata split off of a business in which the split off entity is to be accounted for at fair value 
the company was considered to be the split off entity since emerging communications  inc had the greater market capitalization and greater asset value immediately after the transaction  retained more of the pre transaction top management of the company and had greater net income in accordingly  the balance sheet of the company at december  was adjusted to fair value as evidenced by the market capitalization of the company immediately after the consummation of the transaction 
this adjustment included an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated net fixed assets  and an approximately million reduction in the company s consolidated stockholders equity 
the fair value adjustment reduced the carrying value on the company s consolidated financial statements of its fixed assets significantly below their historical cost and replacement value 
therefore  depreciation expense for periods after december  is not a reliable indicator of the company s cost of replenishing its assets 
the combined selected financial data included in this report have been derived from combined financial statements relating to atlantic tele network  inc s business and operations in guyana including its majority owned subsidiary  gt t  and atn s activities as the parent company of all of its subsidiaries during the years ended december  and these combined financial statements do not reflect the fair valuation adjustment arising from the split up transaction 
moreover  the combined statement of operations includes interest income from indebtedness of subsidiaries which were transferred with such indebtedness to emerging communications  inc in the split up transaction and certain expenses for the period from may  to december  which were reimbursed by emerging communications  inc as part of the split up transaction 
on december  gt t filed an application with the puc for a significant increase in rates for local and outbound international long distance service so as to enable gt t to earn a return on its rate base 
effective february   gt t was awarded an interim increase in rates 
subsequently on march   the puc reduced its interim rate increase effective in part on april  and in part on may  the reduced rates represented a substantial increase over the rates in effect during and earlier years 
on october  and august   to reflect changed conditions since december   gt t filed for additional rate increases designed to generate million and million in additional revenues over and above the interim rates currently in effect 
gt t s applications for a permanent rate increase are still pending before the puc 
no assurance can be given as to what permanent rates the puc will award gt t or as to what changes the puc may make in the current interim rates 
the company is cautiously optimistic that it will receive favorable action on its rate applications during the current year 
results of operations years ended december  and telephone operating revenues for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for net income for was million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  for operating results for includes  of revenue recognized from the settlement of a dispute with an international telecommunications carrier resulting in a net gain of  or

after excluding this one time item  the company s core operating revenues and earnings for were million and million  respectively  or per share 
excluding the one time item in discussed above  core revenues in decreased by million or 
this decrease in revenues was attributable primarily to the decline in audiotext traffic through audiotext traffic declined to million minutes in as compared to million minutes in  a decline of million minutes 
offsetting the decrease in audiotext traffic  regular inbound international minutes increased from million minutes in to million minutes in this increase in regular inbound traffic resulted in an increase of million in revenue over the company expects that audiotext traffic volumes will continue to decline  although the company is unable to predict future audiotext revenues and traffic volumes with any degree of certainty 
local exchange service revenues increased by million or during as a result of increased cellular revenue and increased lines in service which rose to  at december  from  lines in service at december   an increase of  lines or 
international long distance inbound revenues other than audiotext increased to million in from million in excluding the  of revenue recognized from the settlement mentioned above  this represents an increase of million or and is due to the increase in inbound minutes of traffic mentioned above 
management believes that this increase in inbound telephone traffic other than audiotext is indirectly the result of the increase in temporary rates for outbound long distance traffic granted by the puc in early because a substantial portion of gt t s international traffic  other than audiotext  consists of personal calls between guyanese expatriates and their friends and families in guyana  management believes that an increase in rates for outbound calls results not only in a decrease in the volume of outbound calls but an increase in the volume of inbound calls 
as is noted elsewhere in this report see gt t regulation  the fcc has adopted mandatory international settlement rate benchmarks for payments by us telecommunications carriers to telecommunications carriers in other countries including guyana  and gt t s operating agreement with worldcom is scheduled to terminate effective may  any significant reduction in the volume of inbound traffic from the united states to guyana or in the settlement rate for this traffic could have a significant adverse impact on gt t s earnings 
any of these events would provide gt t with a basis to seek an increase in rates for local and outbound international service so as to permit gt t to earn its contractually provided rate of return 
however  there can be no assurance as to when or whether gt t would receive such a rate increase 
international long distance outbound revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or as traffic increased from million minutes to million minutes from to these increases in outbound traffic and the resultant revenues are due primarily to the increase in lines in service discussed above

in the four quarters of  audiotext traffic averaged million  million  million and million minutes per month  respectively 
the decline in revenues in the second and third quarters of was due in part to an increase in the refiling or mislabeling of traffic from the united states and united kingdom to guyana

international long distance inbound revenues other than audiotext increased to million in from million in excluding the  of revenue recognized from the settlement mentioned above  this represents an increase of million or and correlates to an increase in inbound minutes of traffic from million in to million in  an increase of million minutes or 
management believes that this increase in inbound telephone traffic other than audiotext is indirectly the result of the increase in temporary rates for outbound long distance traffic granted by the puc in early because a substantial portion of gt t s international traffic  other than audiotext  consists of personal calls between guyanese expatriates and their friends and families in guyana  management believes that an increase in rates for outbound calls results not only in a decrease in the volume of outbound calls but an increase in the volume of inbound calls 
international long distance outbound revenues decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million or

telephone operating expenses were million for as compared to million for after eliminating the gain of million from the devaluation of the guyana dollar which reduced operating expenses core telephone operating expenses were million in this represents a decrease of million or in core telephone operating expense

the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to for the minority interest in earnings consists primarily of the guyana government s interest in gt t 
regulatory and tax issues the company is involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its existing liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet current operating and capital needs  although the company is currently seeking external financing for a portion of the wireless world s current expansion activities 
the company s primary source of funds at the parent company level are advisory fees and dividends from gt t 
the tax and regulatory issues discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report could have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity 
gt t is not subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
if and when the company settles outstanding tax and regulatory issues with the guyana government and the puc  gt t may require additional external financing to enable gt t to further expand its telecommunications facilities 
the company has not estimated the cost to comply with the october puc order to increase the number of telephone lines in service  but believes such a project may require significant capital expenditures that would require external financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
a portion of gt t s taxes in guyana may be payable in us dollars or other hard currencies 
the company believes that the majority of gt t s revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars or other hard currencies 
however  as a result of the rate increases recently awarded to and currently sought by gt t and the efforts of the us fcc and carriers in various countries to reduce international accounting rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of the company s revenues will be earned in guyana currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on the conversion of guyana currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyana currency or foreign currency from guyana  there is little liquidity in the foreign currency markets in guyana 
while the company believes that it has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in hard currency to meet its current operating  debt service and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into hard currency to meet such obligations 
at december   approximately million of the company s total cash balances consisted of balances denominated in guyana dollars 
from time to time the company explores opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms the company will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on its consolidated operations in any of the years through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to minimal market risks 
although the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars or other hard currencies  the results of operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
through december   the value of the guyana dollar has remained stable at approximately to the us dollar 
the effect of the devaluation of the guyana dollar on the company s consolidated financial results has not been significant in the periods presented  except that  as is previously discussed in the comparison of and operating results  the company recognized a net gain of million in as a result of the devaluation of the guyana dollar during a substantial majority of the company s consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars on the one hand  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar  on the other hand 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in the company s view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency is the us dollar because the majority of gt t s revenues and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in the company s view  gt t is entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base 
accordingly  devaluations of the guyana dollar should have no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has not approved or disapproved this position of the company
