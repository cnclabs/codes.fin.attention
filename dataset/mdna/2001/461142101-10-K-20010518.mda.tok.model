although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the following significant factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
continued availability of suitable non proprietary computing platforms and system operating software that are compatible with the company s products 
certain components for the company s products are available from select suppliers and  as a result  the company s operating results could be adversely affected if the company were unable to obtain such components in the future 
increasing litigation with respect to the enforcement of patents  copyrights and other intellectual property 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
the ability of the company to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers such as british telecom  which purchases both systems and managed services from the company 
sales to british telecom accounted for approximately and of the company s total sales during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s installed base of customers generally are not contractually obligated to place further systems orders with the company or to extend their services contracts with the company at the expiration of their current contracts 
british telecom s managed services contract with the company was recently extended by eighteen months through july  under the managed services agreement  bt cellnet is currently purchasing services in a minimum amount of approximately million per month  and the minimum amount will be reduced to million per month for the six month period commencing july   and further reduced to a flat fee of  per month for the eighteen month period commencing on january  see item business for an expanded discussion of the asp managed services agreement with bt cellnet 
legislative and administrative changes and  in particular  changes affecting the telecommunications industry  such as the telecommunications act of the company s sales are largely dependent upon the strength of the domestic and international economies and  in particular  demand for the types of systems offered by the company in its primary markets 
in this regard  demand for all of the company s systems is partially dependent upon the general level of demand for telecommunications equipment  computers  software and other technology products 
furthermore  demand for the company s products offered to telecommunications companies is very dependent upon the general level of demand for telephone switches and other telecommunications equipment for public networks 
there are certain indications that  at least for the short term  demand for such technology products and network based telecommunications equipment might be softening 
risks involved in the company s international distribution and sale of its products  including unexpected and adverse changes in regulatory requirements  unexpected changes in exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights  and foreign governmental regulations that may limit or restrict sales of call automation systems 
additionally  changes in foreign credit markets and currency exchange rates may result in requests by many international customers for extended payment terms and may have an adverse impact on the company s cash flow and its level of accounts receivable 
due in part to the merger with brite  the company s sales outside the united states  as a percentage of the company s total sales  increased from to from the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any fiscal quarter  which can cause wide variations in the company s sales and earnings on a quarterly basis 
many of the company s contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of liquidated damages for delayed performance by the company 
since the company s projects frequently require a significant degree of customization  it is difficult for the company to predict when it will complete such projects 
accordingly  the company has had to pay liquidated damages in the past and may have to pay additional liquidated damages in the future 
any such future liquidated damages could be significant 
the company s ability to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts in developing application software and otherwise tailoring its systems to customer specific requests 
the company s ability to hire and retain  within the company s compensation parameters  qualified sales  administrative and technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for the services of such personnel 
mergers and acquisitions between companies in the telecommunications and financial industries which could result in fewer companies purchasing the company s products for telecommunications and financial applications  and or delay such purchases by companies that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a merger or acquisition 
extreme price and volume trading volatility in the us stock market  which has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies  frequently for reasons other than the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the ability of the company to successfully integrate the products  customers  employees and other business components of the former intervoice and the former brite in an efficient fashion 
the ability of the company to retain certain customers of the former brite in light of the company s decision to phase out certain brite products and its ability to persuade such customers to purchase similar products offered by the company 
the company s business transactions in foreign currencies are subject to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates

sales the company sells call automation systems and services to both new and existing customers in two major market categories i ivr systems and ii enhanced telecommunications services systems 
due to customer demand  many of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the size and timing of some transactions have historically resulted in sales fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
in the past  the impact of these fluctuations has been mitigated to some extent by the geographic and vertical market diversification of the company s existing and prospective customers 
however  the company has become more prone to quarterly sales fluctuations due to its sales to the enhanced telecommunications services systems market  which are generally large in dollar amount and unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
effective march   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
for systems that do not require customization to be performed by the company  revenue is now recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when the related hardware and software are delivered and any installation or other post delivery obligation has been fulfilled  when the fee is fixed or determinable and when collection is probable 
in prior years  although the company s contracts often included installation and customer acceptance provisions  revenue generally was recognized at the time of shipment based on the company s belief that no significant uncertainties about customer acceptance existed 
for systems that require significant customization and where the completed contract method of accounting is applicable  the company now recognizes revenue upon customer acceptance 
prior to the implementation of sab  the company recognized revenue on these systems upon completion of installation and testing but prior to customer acceptance 
for more complex  customized systems generally ones with a sales price of  or more  the company continues to use a percentage of completion methodology based on labor inputs 
the company also continues to recognize revenues from services when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for revenue recognition associated with the company s adoption of sab has been reflected as a charge to fiscal operations and is discussed below in income loss from operations and net income loss 
as a result of the change  the company recognized as part of fiscal sales million of revenue whose contribution to income is included in the cumulative effect adjustment and did not recognize million of sales whose contribution to income would have been recognized had the change in accounting policy not been adopted 
see the table of pro forma sales activity below 
as described under in process research and development below  the company s merger with brite in fiscal was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  results of brite s operations have been consolidated with those of intervoice effective with the company s second fiscal quarter of fiscal with no retroactive adjustments 
see the table of pro forma sales activity below 
to enhance comparability of the company s sales for fiscal  and  the sales information below is presented on both an as reported and an as adjusted basis 
the as adjusted amounts reflect pro forma sales as though the merger with brite and the adoption of sab had occurred as of the end of fiscal as adjusted as reported ivr systems enhanced telecommunications services systems services total intervoice brite s fiscal year ends the last day of february 
brite s fiscal year ended december no adjustment has been made to account for the two companies different fiscal year ends 
as adjusted amounts do not include sales by brite s tsl division  which was sold december worldwide sales on an as reported basis declined in fiscal and increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in sales during fiscal was primarily the result of a and a decline in ivr systems and enhanced telecommunications services systems sales  respectively  partially offset by a increase in services sales 
the decline in sales during fiscal included the impact of approximately million resulting from a stronger us dollar  on average  as compared to fiscal the company s merger with brite was the primary reason for the company s sales increase during fiscal the following discussion compares sales performance on an as adjusted basis ivr system sales decreased in fiscal the decline in such sales was attributable to a sluggishness in demand from the former brite customer base  as those companies evaluated the company s product roadmap resulting from the merger with brite  a sluggish demand from the company s existing and prospective customers as they evaluated their post yk capital expenditures  some possible softness  at least in the near term  in the market for telecommunications equipment  computers  software and other technology products  and a lengthening of the overall sales cycle resulting from a transition in customer demand from relatively simple  touchtone based applications to complex applications employing speech recognition 
ivr system sales were level from to and increased in fiscal as a result of the company s continued investment in product development  expansion of its distribution channels and its marketing and advertising programs  and the hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
international ivr system sales constituted  and of the company s total ivr system sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
enhanced telecommunications services systems sales decreased in fiscal while third party surveys indicate good long term prospects for growth in the markets addressed by the company s enhanced telecommunications services systems  the company believes contributing factors to the sales decline during fiscal include its sales force attrition and some possible softness  at least for the short term  in the market for telecommunications equipment and other technology products 
such sales increased and in fiscal and the increases were attributable to the company s investments in product development  expansion of its distribution channels and its marketing and advertising programs  and hiring and training of new and existing sales  service and support personnel 
international enhanced telecommunication services system sales constituted  and  of the company s total enhanced telecommunications services systems sales in fiscal  and  respectively

no other customer accounted for or more of the company s sales during fiscal   or special charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its organizational structure and eliminated certain product offerings in order to reduce cost and improve its focus on its core competencies and products 
as a result of these actions  the company incurred special charges of million  including million for severance and related costs  million for the write off of assets associated with discontinued product lines and million for estimated customer accommodations related to the discontinued product lines 
the workforce adjustments and product eliminations are expected to reduce the company s quarterly expenses by million from third quarter fiscal levels when fully realized 
such expense reductions could be offset  in part  by spending increases to pursue new opportunities being created in the company s markets by the convergence of voice  wireless data and internet technologies 
the severance and related costs were associated with a workforce adjustment that affected approximately employees and included the resignation of the company s president and chief operating officer 
of the total costs incurred  million  million and million were charged to cost of goods sold  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively 
as of february   million of the total severance and related costs remained unpaid 
the million charge to write off assets is primarily attributable to the company s decision to discontinue its agentconnect product line and includes a million charge for the impairment of unamortized purchased software associated with this product 
the charge is reflected in cost of goods sold 
the million charge for estimated customer accommodations is comprised primarily of bad debts and customer settlements associated with the company s decision to discontinue the agentconnect product line 
this charge is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fiscal income from operations and net loss were impacted by second quarter special charges of million including million reported in cost of goods sold relating to a comprehensive cross license agreement with an affiliate of lucent technologies  inc and provisions for inventories and certain intangible assets made obsolete by the company s merger with brite  and million reported in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily relating to severance charges for intervoice employees made redundant as a result of the merger with brite and charges relating to bad debts arising from the impairment of certain foreign accounts receivable and from the cancellation of certain customer trade in obligations

during fiscal and fiscal  the company incurred special charges totaling million and million  respectively  as described in the preceding special charges section 
without these special and non recurring charges during fiscal and  cost of goods sold  as a percentage of total sales  would have been and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  during fiscal is attributable to the company s continued investment in application engineering and customer service resources to support opportunities in all its markets 
the increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of total sales  during fiscal is attributable to the company s merger with brite which  historically  has had a higher third party hardware content and thus more cost in its systems 
the company has taken certain actions to reduce a portion of its cost of goods sold during fiscal these actions are discussed above in special charges 
research and development research and development expenses during fiscal were approximately million  or of the company s total sales 
such expenses in fiscal were approximately million and included a million charge for in process research and development see in process research and development below  incurred in connection with the brite merger 
net of this charge  research and development expenses were approximately million  or of the company s total sales  during fiscal such expenses were million  or of the company s total sales  during fiscal the large increase in fiscal in such expenses is the result of the company s merger with brite 
recurring research and development expenses during fiscal  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company expects to maintain its strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business segments  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
in process research and development during fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of brite in a two step transaction involving aggregate consideration of approximately million including million of cash and  shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
brite provided voice processing and call processing systems and services which incorporate prepaid postpaid applications  voice response  voice recognition  voice facsimile messaging  audiotex and interactive computer applications into both standard products and customized market solutions 
the company s consolidated statements of operations reflect the results of operations of brite beginning june  the merger has been accounted for as a purchase business combination 
the aggregate purchase price for brite was approximately million  which included million of direct costs and million of assumed liabilities  primarily accrued severance costs for brite employees and lease termination cancellation costs associated with the elimination of excess facilities 
as of february   assumed liabilities of million remained outstanding 
such costs  comprised primarily of lease termination accruals  are anticipated to be paid out over the remaining lease terms 
the purchase price has been allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values which were determined by an independent valuation and by the company s management based on information furnished by management of brite 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in millions working capital property and equipment other assets other liabilities identified intangible assets purchased in process r d expensed deferred tax liability on identified intangibles goodwill identified intangibles include developed technology million  customer relationships million  assembled workforce million  and trade name million 
identified intangibles and the excess of cost over net assets acquired ie goodwill are being amortized on a straight line basis over years and years  respectively 
in process r d of million was expensed at the time of acquisition as the company determined that the in process r d had not reached technological feasibility based on the status of design and development activities that required further refinement and testing 
brite s in process r d related to technologies which support brite s interactive voice response ivr computer telephony integration cti  intelligent network  messaging  voice dialing  and prepaid postpaid product families 
the valuation of existing product technology and in process r d was performed using the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows  and risks associated with achieving such cash flows 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of the existing products and in process r d projects and best represents the present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of in process r d included the stages of completion of r d projects  projected operating cash flows  and the discount rate 
at the time of the merger  brite management estimated the remaining cost to complete the in process r d projects to be approximately million with a remaining time requirement of approximately months 
projected operating cash flows were expected to begin in fiscal the discount rate selected for brite s in process technologies was 
as of february   the projects had been completed 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million during fiscal and included special charges totaling million see special charges 
sg a expenses were million during fiscal and included non recurring charges totaling million 
sg a expenses  net of special and non recurring charges  were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  or  and of the company s total sales  respectively 
the increase in these expenses during fiscal was the result of the company s decision to continue to hire and train new and existing sales and sales support personnel  and to expand its marketing and advertising programs worldwide 
the increase in such expenses during fiscal was attributable to the company s merger with brite 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets was approximately million and million during fiscal and goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the merger with brite totaled approximately million with useful lives ranging from to years 
the company incurred four quarters of amortization expense in fiscal compared to three quarters in fiscal the company incurred no such expenses during fiscal other income during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company realized a gain of million from the sale of speechworks international  inc common stock acquired through the exercise of a warrant received in connection with a supply agreement between the company and speechworks 
in prior periods  the warrant had been assigned no value in the company s balance sheets because the warrant and the shares underlying the warrant were unregistered securities  and significant uncertainties existed regarding the company s ability to monetize the warrant and the timing of any such monetization 
other income during fiscal and was primarily interest income on cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense of approximately million and million was incurred during fiscal and substantially all of this expense relates to the company s long term borrowings obtained in connection with the merger with brite see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the company s long term borrowings 
interest expense was approximately million during fiscal income taxes the company s income tax expense for fiscal differs significantly from the federal statutory rate primarily due to non deductible charges during the period relating to in process r d and amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with brite

in fiscal  the company incurred previously mentioned non recurring charges reported in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses totaling million and a non recurring charge of million for in process research and development relating to its merger with brite 
excluding the special and non recurring charges and gain discussed above  the company would have generated operating income of approximately million and million and income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating income and income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal operating income and income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  versus the previous year  is primarily attributable to the company s decision to continue investment in marketing  application engineering  and research and development resources without a corresponding increase in the company s sales 
these investments were made to continue to pursue opportunities in the ivr and enhanced telecommunications services systems markets 
the increase in fiscal income from operations and income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  versus the previous year  is primarily attributable to the company s merger with brite 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on prior years associated with the company s adoption of sab resulted in a charge to income of million after reduction for income taxes of million in fiscal assuming the accounting change had been applied retroactively by the company to prior periods  proforma net loss for fiscal and proforma net income for would have been million and million  respectively 
net loss per common share would have been in  and net income per diluted share would have been in had the company not adopted sab  revenues for fiscal would have been million and net loss per common share would have been

financing activities during fiscal included an increase in borrowings of million under the company s revolving credit facility for working capital 
other financing activities included the receipt of million as proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the pay down of million on the company s term loan borrowings 
days sales outstanding dso s of accounts receivable continues to be a focus for the company 
at february   dso s were days  compared to days at february  with the merger with brite in fiscal  the company now generates a significant percentage of its sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services systems  outside the united states 
customers outside the united states are accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer its most credit worthy customers such payment terms 
in fiscal and fiscal  customer extended payment terms had no material adverse impact on the company s days sales outstanding dso s of accounts receivable 
however  there is no assurance such extended payment terms will not adversely impact dso s in fiscal and beyond 
the company believes its cash reserves and internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to meet its operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company has access to million available under its revolving credit facility 
the company reviews share repurchase and acquisition opportunities from time to time and believes it has access to the financial resources necessary to pursue attractive repurchase and or acquisition opportunities as they arise 
however  the term loan and revolving credit agreement discussed below includes normal and customary provisions which limit the company s ability to make such acquisitions 
in connection with the merger with brite  the company entered into a loan agreement with bank of america and nine other banks to provide a senior secured credit facility amounting to million  including a million term loan and a million revolving credit agreement 
the term loan agreement is subject to scheduled repayments  as defined  during the revolving credit agreement will expire upon the earlier of the termination of the term loan  or august  the cash required to service the facilities could have a material impact upon the operating cash requirements of the company for the foreseeable future 
at may   the company had borrowed million under the agreement  at an average annual interest rate of 
interest under the credit facility accrues at variable rates indexed to the prime rate  the federal funds rate or an adjusted london interbank offering rate 
during fiscal and  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to change the characteristics of interest payments on its long term borrowings from libor based variable rate payments to fixed rate payments 
the total notional amount covered by the arrangements ranged from million during and a portion of to million as of february  as of february   the variable rates of and under the long term borrowings had been swapped for an effective rate of 
the effect of interest rate swaps on the company s interest expense during fiscal and was immaterial 
the swap arrangements expire in june impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts 
the absence of such contracts should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects 
the company s debt facilities financing is considered to be a material long term debt obligation  which may expose the company to inflationary effects associated with such variable rate loans  however  the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge such exposure

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the company s current term loan and revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on either a prime rate  the federal funds rate or the london interbank offering rate  plus an applicable margin 
as of february   the company had million outstanding  under the credit agreement 
maturities under long term borrowings are scheduled as follows for fiscal years subsequent to february  million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the credit agreement matures on august   and the term loan facility is subject to quarterly principal amortization 
the fair value of the borrowings approximates the carrying value at february  due to the magnitude of this credit facility  the company believes that the effects of any reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows may be material 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate changes  the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements with a total notional amount of million to change the characteristics of interest payments on its long term borrowings from libor based variable rate payments to fixed rate payments 
as of february   the variable rates of and under the term loan and revolving credit facilities had been swapped for an effective rate of 
the effect of interest rate swaps on the company s interest expense during fiscal was immaterial 
the interest rate swaps expire in june foreign currency risks the company transacts business in certain foreign currencies  including the british pound 
accordingly  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company generally mitigates this risk by transacting business in the functional currency of each of its subsidiaries  thus creating a natural hedge by paying expenses incurred in the local currency in which revenues will be received
