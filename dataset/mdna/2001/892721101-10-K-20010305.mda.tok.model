its revenues were generated primarily through fees paid for customer acquisitions and ongoing commissions earned under revenue sharing arrangements with carriers 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company began the process of migrating and expanding its direct marketing business activities to the internet 
its database marketing strategy remained the same but the recipients changed from only postal addresses and telephone numbers to primarily internet e mail addresses 
one of the company s first initiatives in implementing its on line marketing strategy was the december launch of the free lottery website  www 
grouplotto 
com  by a majority owned subsidiary of the company  where a registered player has a chance to win prizes of up to million 
in exchange for playing the lottery  the player agrees to receive the company s marketing promotions

through the grouplotto website  the company has collected e mail and postal addresses from consumers who have given permission opted in to receive promotional e mail messages from the company and third party promotional affiliates 
today  traffix  inc is a database marketing and management company that utilizes the grouplotto website and its databases  which contain in excess of million permission based  on line consumers  and in excess of million off line postal addresses  to generate revenue form direct marketing related activities 
the company changed its name from quintel communications  inc to traffix  inc  effective october   to better reflect the company s business of generating and directing consumer traffic for businesses  both on line and off line 
the company generates revenue from three main sources 
first  it generates revenue when consumers register for and play the free on line lottery at the grouplotto website 
the company is paid by its advertiser clients when players elect to view the advertisements for  or otherwise enroll with  such advertisers 
second  the company has and continues to accumulate a large list of consumer data  such as e mail addresses  postal addresses and telephone numbers  from individuals who have granted the company permission to market to them on line 
the company then sends offers and promotions to these individuals on behalf of its marketing clients 
the company also sends certain of these offers and promotions to the databases of third party marketing affiliates on a revenue share or fixed price basis 
the company gets paid for sales or leads generated for these offers cost per acquisition or cpa  and also on a traditional cost per thousand cpm of e mails sent basis 
third  the company rents for one time usage its databases  and sells copies of specific segments of its databases  to third parties for direct marketing on line  via telemarketing or through regular mail

during the fiscal year ended november  fiscal  the company had e commerce segment revenue of  which increased during fiscal to  the company believes this increase was primarily the result of the launch of the free on line lottery website  www 
grouplotto 
com  by a majority owned subsidiary of the company 
players of the free lottery game can win a variety of prizes  including up to million 
the lottery is insured by independent third parties so that the company does not have to pay for the top prizes from its own cash resources 
the insurer charges the company a premium per player 
in less than one year  this site had become one of the most visited websites on the internet 
the company believes this has allowed it to expand its proprietary and affiliate database to over million permission based  on line consumers 
the company uses this extensive database and the website to generate revenues in several ways 
the delivery of on line traffic to corporate advertisers and marketing partners websites click through revenue  the delivery of qualified registrants to corporate advertisers and marketing partners  the sale of products and services on behalf of third parties through targeted  permission based  opt in e mail marketing messages to the company s on line database  and to the databases of the company s marketing affiliates  and the sale of a copy of  or rental of  all or portions of the company s extensive consumer database to third party marketers

during fiscal  the company generated its off line customer acquisition revenue exclusively from long distance customer acquisition agreements with two long distance providers  qwest communications and talk 
com 
the company provided marketing services to the long distance carrier lci international telecom corp  d b a qwest communications services qwest  primarily through outbound telemarketing and broadcast media  directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for qwest 
in addition to commissions paid to the company for its successful customer acquisitions on behalf of qwest  the company also received a portion of qwest s net revenues earned from such acquired customers residential long distance usage 
this marketing arrangement with qwest was terminated in fiscal  and the company does not expect to receive any further revenue from qwest 
the company entered into a series of agreements with talk 
com holding corp 
talk during fiscal  pursuant to which the company provided marketing services to talk directed at the acquisition of residential long distance customers for talk 
such agreements obligated talk to pay the company fees for its successful customer acquisitions on behalf of talk 
in october  talk terminated its agreements with the company and  accordingly  the company no longer realizes any continuing revenues therefrom 
the company has commenced legal proceedings to contest what it believes to be talk s wrongful termination of its agreements with the company 
see legal proceedings 
for the fiscal years ended november   and  the income generated under the off line customer acquisition segment collectively accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company presently has no material off line customer acquisition agreements in effect 
lec billed products and services segment enhanced telephone services during fiscal  the company continued to service the subscribers of its various enhanced telephone services enhanced services  principally voice mail services

for a more detailed discussion of the decrease in off line customer acquisition services segment revenues see transactions with major customers 
the decline in the lec billed products and services segment was primarily due to the residual effects of the company s termination of the active marketing of such services in november see service bureaus and local exchange carriers and prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods for an expanded discussion of such decrease 
additionally  decreases in net revenues from the lec billed products and services segment were partially offset by adjustments to chargeback estimates from prior fiscal periods 
due to the fact that a significant portion of these previously offered lec segment services have reached their contractual settlement phase  it was determined that certain chargeback reserves were no longer necessary  and approximately million was credited to income for the year ended november  the company s cost of sales are comprised of direct and indirect marketing costs directly associated with the procurement and retention of customers  including direct response advertising costs  marketing partner profit participation costs  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and the related billing  collection and customer service costs 
during the year ended november   the company s cost of revenues were offset by net revenue generated from certain premium offerings made in conjunction with the company s marketing of other products and services 
the company terminated the marketing of these products and service in conjunction with the transaction agreements more fully described in prior year transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods 
all such residual revenues from those premium offerings are reflected in the company s other income expense section  as a component of other non operating income  and amounted to approximately million for the year ended november  the company s cost of sales for the years ended november  and are presented below segment data cost of sales cost of sales change inc dec change inc dec year ended november  e commerce    off line customer acquisition services    lec billed products and services    corporate and other   consolidated totals    consolidated cost of sales  by component cost of sales change inc change inc dec dec year ended november  advertising  promotion and fulfillment costs    service bureau fees  including customer service and psychic operators    pay per call premium net revenue   total    the decrease in cost of sales is directly attributable to the company s significantly reduced marketing efforts and related expenditures for the year ended november   when compared to the year ended november  the primary factor contributing to this reduction was the termination of the marketing of the residential long distance customer acquisition activities with qwest 
this termination was effective november   and  therefore  the year ended november  did not include the cost of revenues regarding this arrangement 
this agreement was active during the entire year ended november  and caused the company to incur all of the attendant costs of revenue  such as outbound telemarketing  direct mail  television broadcast media  fulfillment costs and customer service 
see transactions with major customers 
the advertising  promotion and fulfillment decreases associated with the qwest agreement termination were partially offset by increases in customer acquisition costs in obtaining registered users for its websites and the costs associated with acquiring long distance customers  both on line and off line  for the company s customer acquisition agreement with talk 
com 
the talk 
com agreement  initially entered into in may  and then replaced by a long term contract in september  was terminated by talk 
com on october  see transactions with major customers  which termination the company is contesting in arbitration see legal proceedings 
the decrease in cost of revenues is also attributable to the significant decrease in service bureaus fees during the year ended november  of approximately million  or  when compared to the year ended november  the primary factor contributing to this decrease in service bureau fees relates to the decrease in the company s lec segment products and services billed during the year ended november   when compared to the year ended november   with net revenues generated from the offering of such products and services subject to service bureau fees having decreased approximately 
the billing of these lec products and services generated a bill delivery costs  b post billing and collection management costs and c data maintenance costs  with the majority of those costs being invoiced as a percentage of the related gross revenue billed 
during the year ended november   the cost of revenue was also reduced for adjustments made to prior period fulfillment liability estimates 
the adjustments reduced prior year estimates to amounts actually redeemed 
the total amount of these reductions to cost of sales approximated the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a are principally comprised of a compensation costs and related expenses for executive  sales  finance  information systems and general administration personnel  b professional fees  c insurance costs  d occupancy and other equipment rental costs  e site development and modification costs related to the company s e commerce segment  and f all other general and miscellaneous corporate expense items

during the year ended november  the company expended approximately million on website development  hosting  enhancements  maintenance  and consulting fees 
the company also expended approximately million on contingent prize based insurance to cover the possibility of winners of its free on line lottery website 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in personnel utilized in maintaining the company s legacy businesses 
such decreases were principally recognized during the first six months of the fiscal year ended november  the legacy business personnel cost reductions were partially offset by increases in human resources and development costs associated with the company s e commerce segment 
additional reductions in sg a are attributable to the terms of an agreement entered into by the company in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended november   pursuant to which the company i eliminated its media buying operation  which included a staff of approximately twenty one employees  ii was released from a continuing rent expense obligation under an assignment of a lease for the office space occupied by such media department  and iii disposed of all the media operation s property and equipment

the individual components of such decrease are described below 
the decrease was partially attributable to reductions in the company s enhanced service revenues of approximately million  or a reduction when compared with the prior year 
this decline in enhanced service net revenue was the direct result of the company discontinuing the active marketing of such services in response to the november billing service agreement termination by billing information concepts  inc bic  the company s primary enhanced service billing agent at that time 
the company continued to bill and provide enhanced services to the member base that was in place at the time of the billing cessation approximately  subscribers 
during the year ended november   the company recognized an approximate reduction in such residual member base 
as a result of the termination of enhanced service marketing and the above referenced attrition rate  management believes that the enhanced service portion of the company s net revenues will continue to decline  and be an immaterial component thereof  in the fiscal year ending november  see service bureau and local exchange carriers 
the decrease in the lec billed product and service segment net revenue was due also  in part  to reductions in the company s club product net revenues of approximately million  or  when compared with the year ended november  the significant cause of such reduction in club net revenues relates to an agreement entered into between the company and access resources services  inc ars  which eliminated the company s active participation in the pay per call business the ars agreement 
such agreement is more fully described in consummation of transactions impacting current and future fiscal periods 
additionally  the company s intentional migration away from the entertainment service business which was the exclusive avenue for club product marketing and member procurement materially contributed to the decrease in such net revenues during the year ended november  this reduction was partially offset by royalty income of approximately million  earned in consideration for the termination of the company s active role in the pay per call business 
the royalty agreement became effective june   and therefore  there was no comparative prior year royalty revenue 
the lec billed product and service segment s single largest decrease related to the company s entertainment services  specifically the pay per call portion 
this decrease in net revenues amounted to approximately million  or a decrease when compared with the prior year and is directly related to both the cessation of the company s active participation in the pay per call business as a result of the consummation of the ars agreement  as well as the june repositioning of such revenue as an offsetting component of the cost of sales of the company s customer acquisition services segment 
see prior year special charge 
other reductions in the company s net revenues were attributable to the customer acquisition services segment  where decreases in conventional cellular phone customer acquisitions approximated million  or a reduction when compared to the prior year  and a decrease in prepaid cellular phone customer acquisitions of million  or when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in conventional cellular acquisitions was the result of the company s sale  on november   of its interest in the consolidated majority owned entity that provided such services 
the decrease in prepaid cellular phone customer acquisitions was the result of the company s dissolution of its prepaid cellular phone customer acquisition subsidiary  effective december  the company s net revenue decreases were partially mitigated by the customer acquisition service segment  specifically from the long distance customer acquisition component ldca of such segment 
ldca revenues and related usage increased by approximately million from the prior year s comparable period  or 
the customer acquisition commission component decreased from approximately million in the year ended november  to approximately million in the year ended november   for a decrease of approximately million  or 
due to the cessation of the company s primary long distance customer acquisition program with qwest  effective july   and the complete cessation of all other qwest marketing efforts in november see termination of residential long distance customer acquisition marketing  management anticipates that the long distance acquisition commission revenues will be non existent in subsequent fiscal periods 
the company s net revenues earned pursuant to usage sharing agreements with qwest  whereby the company earned a percentage of an acquired customer s long distance telephone usage  increased to approximately million in the year ended november   from approximately  for the year ended november   representing an increase of approximately million 
the percentage of usage sharing revenues to which the company will be entitled to in future fiscal periods has been substantially reduced pursuant to the november  cessation of the company s marketing efforts directed at acquiring new long distance customers for qwest 
the usage sharing agreement revenues are a product of current customer acquisitions and the retained customers acquired in prior quarterly periods 
pursuant to the company s terminated marketing efforts  management believes that the company s net revenues under existing usage sharing agreements will decline in future fiscal periods  and become a less meaningful component of the company s customer acquisition segment revenues 
the company s reported net revenues are a product of the gross revenues generated within each reporting period less the provision for chargebacks for the related reporting period  which is recorded as a direct reduction from such gross revenues  except for revenues generated from royalties and long distance acquisition commissions  which are not subject to provision for consumer chargebacks

the company s cost of revenues  which are comprised of marketing costs directly associated with the procurement and retention of customers  which includes direct response advertising costs  promotional costs and premium fulfillment costs  and the related billing  collection and customer service costs  both of which are offset by the net revenue generated from certain premium offerings in conjunction with the marketing of other products and services

the reduction of these costs resulted from the company s discontinuance of marketing its enhanced services in response to the termination  by bic  of the billing services agreement in november see service bureaus and local exchange carriers 
in addition  the company significantly reduced its marketing efforts directed at the company s residential long distance customer acquisition activities  and effective november   terminated such efforts  due to a increased costs incurred in acquiring long distance customers  b associated fulfillment cost increases and unfavorable redemption rates  and c significantly increased customer service costs 
these three factors contributed to decreased margins in the company s long distance customer acquisition component of its customer acquisition services segment 
additionally  the decreases in the cost of revenues was attributable to the discontinuance of the company s active marketing of its pay per call services see prior year special charge  and the commencement of offering such service as a premium to potential and acquired long distance customers  with the net revenues earned therefrom recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing costs

the company s effective income tax rate was a result of the combination of federal income taxes at statutory rates and state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at november   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  reflecting a decrease of approximately million when compared to the million in cash and cash equivalents held at november  this decrease was more than offset by an increase in the company s liquid interest bearing investments of approximately million  discussed below 
during the year ended november   net cash provided by operating activities was  which was primarily attributable to the company s net income million  offset by decreases in the company s accrued expenses and reserves for chargebacks 
the  in net cash used in investing activities primarily resulted from investments in marketable securities purchases  principally high grade commercial paper and auction rate securities 
such securities are managed by the company s professional independent investment manager

historically  the company s primary cash requirements have been to fund the cost of advertising and promotion  with additional funds having been used in the purchasing of equipment and services in connection with the commencement of new business lines and further development of businesses currently being test marketed 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company executed its on line  consumer targeted direct marketing strategy 
the company s future plans and business strategy call for its internet based e commerce segment to be its primary operating focus  with management s intention being for such segment to supply a material portion of future revenues 
the continuation of the internet initiative may have a significant impact on the company s capital and liquidity resources relating to the e commerce segment s possible expenditures for a marketing and advertising campaigns  b the cost of additional personnel required to occupy executive  operational and administrative positions  c product development costs  d new site development and technology based costs  and e other miscellaneous costs 
during the fiscal year ended november   the company s internet business plan and strategy prompted the company to terminate the active marketing of its legacy products and services 
accordingly  this legacy activity may contribute  in a significantly decreasing degree  to the company s cash flows and net income in subsequent fiscal periods 
this should be considered when using the company s historical results in evaluating future operations  cash flows and financial position 
nevertheless  the company continues to explore opportunities to offer other lec billed products and services in the future  if determined to be in the best interests of the company 
under currently proposed operating plans and assumptions  management believes that projected cash flows from operations and available cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company does not have any material long term obligations  nor does the company intend to incur any long term obligations in the near future 
as the company seeks to extend its reach into the e commerce arena  as well as identify new and other consumer oriented products and services  the company may use existing cash reserves  long term financing  or other means to finance such diversification
