overview general we are a development stage company engaged in the development of new and proprietary oral drug delivery technologies 
we have developed two types of oral drug delivery systems  the gastric retention system the gr system and the reduced irritation system the ri system and together  the depomed systems 
the gr system is designed to be retained in the stomach for an extended period of time while it delivers the incorporated drug or drugs  and the ri system is designed to reduce the gastrointestinal irritation that is a side effect of many orally administered drugs 
in addition  the depomed systems are designed to provide continuous  controlled delivery of an incorporated drug 
in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company  depomed  we  us  and our  refer to depomed  inc since the company s inception in august  we have devoted substantially all our efforts to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with pharmaceutical partners in connection with the depomed systems 
our primary activities since inception august  have been  in addition to research and development  establishing our offices and research facilities  recruiting personnel  filing patent applications  developing a business strategy and raising capital 
we have also been involved in revenue generating research and development projects for clients 
to date  we have received only limited revenue  all of which has been from these collaborative research and feasibility arrangements 
in november  we entered into a joint venture with elan corporation  plc  elan pharma international  ltd 
and elan international services  ltd 
together elan to develop products using drug delivery technologies and expertise of both companies 
this joint venture  depomed development  ltd 
ddl  a bermuda limited liability company  is initially owned by depomed and by elan 
ddl funds its research through capital contributions from its partners based on the partners ownership percentage 
ddl subcontracts research and development efforts to depomed  elan and others 
depomed began subcontract development work for ddl in january and an undisclosed product entered phase i clinical trials in december the joint venture expects to select a second compound for product development in the second quarter of we also have in development metformin gr tm  a potential once daily metformin product for the treatment of type ii diabetes 
in january  we completed a phase i clinical trial of metformin gr and  in july  we completed a second phase i clinical trial of metformin gr 
both trials showed positive results  and in the third quarter of we initiated a phase ii clinical trial 
in june  we announced the initiation of a collaboration with avi biopharma  inc avi to investigate the feasibility of controlled oral delivery of avi s proprietary neugene antisense agents 
in january  we announced the successful completion of a clinical trial with our potential once daily antibiotic gr formulation  ciprofloxacin gr tm 
our formulation was found to have comparable bioavailability and had a significantly extended blood plasma concentration profile compared with cipro r  a currently marketed ciprofloxacin hcl immediate release product that is taken twice per day 
ciprofloxacin gr is scheduled to enter phase ii clinical trials later in we are also developing certain other product candidates expected to benefit from incorporation into the depomed systems 
we also have in development a gr system formulation of an undisclosed cardiovascular drug 
we will ultimately seek marketing partners to commercialize these products 
depomed has generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from inception through december   of this loss is attributable to our share of the equity in the net loss of ddl 
we intend to continue investing in the further development of our drug delivery technologies and the depomed systems 
we also intend to internally develop and find partners to commercialize products based on generic and over the counter compounds  such as a metformin gr and ciprofloxacin gr 
depending upon a variety of factors  including collaborative arrangements  available personnel and financial resources  we will conduct or fund clinical trials on such products and will undertake the associated regulatory activities 
we will need to make additional capital investments in laboratories and related facilities 
as additional personnel are hired in and beyond  expenses can be expected to increase from their levels 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in  these revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for our joint venture with elan  ddl  and  earned from another small collaboration 
in  these revenues consisted entirely of amounts earned under the feasibility arrangement with r 
w 
johnson pharmaceutical research institute pri 
in  these revenues consisted of amounts earned under the feasibility and the research and development arrangements with pri and bristol myers squibb company bms  respectively 
we expect to continue to perform development work for ddl at least through revenue from our collaborative agreement with pri declined as a result of our having completed the first phase of formulation development in march we have not had any significant communication with pri regarding their plans for the product since the first quarter of in light of this  we no longer expect to continue research and development work on the project even though the project has not been canceled 
revenues from bms ended in march as a result of our having completed our research activities for bms 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to expenses for clinical trials with depomed proprietary products  which began in the third quarter of  as well as increased use of clinical and regulatory consultants as we prepared for our first phase ii clinical trial that began in the third quarter of the increase was also due to the hiring of additional employees and related expenses  increased laboratory supplies  and increased depreciation and amortization expense of equipment and facilities improvements  as well as  increased research and development expenses associated with our joint venture  ddl 
rent expense also increased in due to our move into a larger facility in march general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
increased salaries and the additional expense incurred during as a result of expanded investor relations activities were partially offset by decreased legal and accounting fees that were realized as we reduced our reliance on outside professionals for some reporting services  and the decreased costs of obtaining directors and officers insurance 
in the fourth quarter of  our joint venture with elan  ddl  was formed 
while we own of the outstanding common stock of ddl  elan and its subsidiaries have retained significant minority investor rights that are considered participating rights as defined in the emerging issues task force consensus no 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the financial statements of ddl  but instead account for our investment in ddl under the equity method of accounting 
separate financial statements for ddl are included elsewhere in this form k 
in  ddl recognized a loss of  which included  in research and development expense and  in legal expense 
our share of the loss was  in  ddl  incurred a  charge for acquiring in process research and development rights related to certain elan drug delivery technologies 
our share of the ddl loss was  ddl will continue to subcontract research and development activities to depomed  elan and others 
in  we expect our share of ddl s losses will be approximately  elan has made available to us a convertible loan facility to assist us in funding our portion of the joint venture losses 
we had a zero basis in the ddl investment as of december  and net interest income was approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease from year to year was due primarily to declining cash and investment balances 
interest expense of  accrued on the elan convertible loan facility also contributed to the net decrease in net interest income also includes immaterial gains realized on the sale of some of our marketable securities 
in january  we issued  shares of series a convertible exchangeable preferred stock at a price of  per share to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
the series a preferred stock accrues a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock is convertible at anytime after january  at elan s option  into depomed s common stock at a price of per share 
for the year ended december   we accrued a dividend on the series a preferred stock of  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations in the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and during the years ended december  and  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss offset by our share in the loss of the joint venture 
in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the increase in net loss 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of approximately  related to the investment in our joint venture and  related to leasehold improvement expenditures and the purchase of lab equipment  which were partially offset by a net decrease in marketable securities of  cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of a net decrease of approximately  of marketable securities offset by purchases of laboratory equipment  fixtures and office equipment 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of purchases of marketable securities totaling  as well as laboratory equipment  fixtures and office equipment 
we expect that future capital expenditures may include additional product development and quality control laboratory equipment as we work towards implementation of current good manufacturing practices cgmp in our laboratories 
we also expect to spend approximately  over the first two quarters of for additional leasehold improvements 
in march  we signed an equipment financing agreement to provide  in financing for equipment and leasehold improvements purchased from august to december cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of proceeds received in private placements of common stock and warrants and preferred stock 
in january a private placement of  shares of common stock was completed at a price of per share  with net proceeds of approximately  also in january  we sold  shares of convertible preferred stock to elan for  per share 
the preferred stock proceeds were used for the initial capitalization of ddl 
in november  a private placement of  shares of common stock and  warrants was completed for net proceeds of  see note of notes to financial statements 
additionally  proceeds of  were received from the loan facility made available to us by elan for use in funding our share of ddl s losses see note of notes to financial statements 
proceeds received were offset by  in payments on equipment loans and capital leases 
cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was approximately  and consisted of payments on an equipment financing credit facility established in and capital lease obligations totaling approximately  offset against  in proceeds from the equipment financing credit facility see note of notes to financial statements 
cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was approximately  which primarily consisted of the proceeds received in february from a private placement of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  with net proceeds of approximately  also in  we financed  of equipment under the credit facility 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  working capital of  and we had accumulated losses of  we expect to continue to incur operating losses over the next several years 
on march  the company signed an equipment financing agreement that will provide financing for equipment and leasehold improvements purchased from august through december see note subsequent events 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including the march capital equipment financing  will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least december  however  we base this expectation on our current operating plan that may change as a result of many factors 
accordingly  we could require additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including o results of research and development  o relationships with collaborative partners  o changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  o technological advances  and o results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to o conduct research and development programs  o conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and o manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the depomed systems 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and no other committed source of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company raises additional capital by selling its equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available the company may have to o curtail operations significantly  or o obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on the company 
recent accounting standards in december  the sec staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we adopted sab  as required  in the fourth quarter of the adoption of sab had no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
on march   the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin  which provides guidance on several implementation issues related to accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb announced the delay of the effective date of statement of financial reporting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities safs  also  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial reporting standards no 
 an amendment to sfas sfas  as amended  requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
change in the fair value of derivatives is recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction  and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
we must adopt sfas  as amended  on january  we do not expect that adoption of sfas  as amended  will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
net operating losses we have not generated any taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately  future utilization of carryforwards may be limited in any fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  anticipated and future losses or changes in ownership of the company  all or a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal income tax liabilities 
factors that may affect future results early stage of development  limited revenues we are at an early stage of development 
accordingly  our business is subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise  including o uncertainties regarding product development  o dependence on collaborative partnering relationships  o lack of revenue and uncertainty regarding future revenues  o limited financial and personnel resources  and o lack of established credit facilities 
as we expand our research and development efforts  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years 
therefore  we expect our cumulative losses to increase 
to date  we have had no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from our collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies 
our success will depend on commercial sales of products that generate significant revenues for us 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to achieve commercial sales of any revenue generating products 
no assurance of successful product development our research and development programs are at an early stage 
in order for us to incorporate a pharmaceutical product into a depomed system  we would need to complete substantial additional research and development on a drug provided by a collaborative partner 
even if we are successful  the collaborative partner s drug incorporated in the depomed system o may not be offered for commercial sale  or o may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects that prevent or limit its commercial use 
before we or others make commercial sales of products using the depomed systems  we or our collaborative partners would need to o conduct clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective  and o obtain regulatory approval 
this process involves substantial financial investment 
successful commercial sales of any of these products require o market acceptance  o cost effective commercial scale production  and o reimbursement under private or governmental health plans 
we will have to curtail  redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that o the depomed systems prove to have unintended or undesirable side effects  or o products which appear promising in preclinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in larger scale clinical trials 
these events could have a material adverse effect on the company 
dependence on elan and other additional collaborative partners we have generated all of our revenues through collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
currently  most of our revenues are derived from our joint venture with elan 
if our joint venture with elan is terminated or fails to produce desired results  our revenues and results of operations will suffer 
our strategy to continue the research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and commercial sale of products using the depomed systems requires that we enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
the company may not be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the success of the elan joint venture and other collaborative arrangements requires that the company s collaborative partners o perform their obligations as expected  and o devote sufficient resources to the development  clinical testing and marketing of products developed under collaborations 
it is possible that our collaborative partners may not o continue to fund their particular projects  o perform their agreed to obligations  or o choose to develop and make commercial sales of products using the depomed systems 
for example  in the first quarter of  we completed the first phase of research and development under a march feasibility agreement with pri 
we have not had any significant communication with pri regarding their plans for the product since the first quarter of in light of this  we no longer expect to continue research and development work on the project even though the project has not been canceled by pri 
there can be no assurance that a collaborative partner s product development decisions will favor the depomed systems or that their timelines will be aligned with our own business strategies 
any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on the company o any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products  o arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude the company from developing products or technologies  o premature termination of an agreement  or o failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development  and commercial sales of products using the depomed systems 
collaborative agreements are generally complex and may contain provisions which give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights and obligations of the parties 
any such dispute could delay collaborative research  development or commercialization of potential products  or could lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
fluctuations in operating results the following factors will affect our quarterly operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on the company o variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements  including milestone payments  royalties  license fees and other contract revenues  o success or failure of the company in entering into further collaborative relationships  o decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of the relationship or program  o the timing of any future product introductions by us or our collaborative partners  o market acceptance of the depomed systems  o regulatory actions  o adoption of new technologies  o the introduction of new products by our competitors  o manufacturing costs and capabilities  o changes in government funding  and o third party reimbursement policies 
reliance on a continuous power supply to conduct business  and disruption of operations and increase of expense from california s current energy crisis california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage  which occurs when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on occasion implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities  which could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
furthermore  the regulatory changes affecting the energy industry instituted in by the california government has caused power prices to increase 
under the revised regulatory scheme  utilities were encouraged to sell their plants  which traditionally had produced most of california s power  to independent energy companies that were expected to compete aggressively on price 
instead  due in part to a shortage of supply  wholesale prices have increased dramatically over the past year 
if wholesale prices continue to increase  our operating expenses will likely increase 
business interruptions that could harm our business our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area  which is known for seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption would result in losses or damages incurred by us and would harm our business 
relationships of advisors with other entities two groups the policy advisory board and development advisory board advise the company on business and scientific issues and future opportunities 
certain members of our policy advisory board and development advisory board work full time for academic or research institutions 
others act as consultants to other companies 
in addition  except for work performed specifically for and at the direction of the company  any inventions or processes discovered by such persons will be their own intellectual property or that of their institutions or other companies 
further  invention assignment agreements signed by such persons in connection with their relationships with the company may be subject to the rights of their primary employers or other third parties with whom they have consulting relationships 
if we desire access to inventions which are not our property  we will have to obtain licenses to such inventions from these institutions or companies 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
healthcare reform  uncertain availability of healthcare reimbursement the healthcare industry is changing rapidly as the public  government  medical professionals  third party payors and the pharmaceutical industry examine ways to contain or reduce the cost of health care 
changes in the healthcare industry could impact our business  particularly to the extent that the company develops the depomed systems for use in prescription drug applications 
certain foreign governments regulate pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals sold in their countries 
there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control in the united states  particularly with respect to medicare payments 
we expect that these proposals will continue to be advanced 
in addition  downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing in the united states has increased due to an enhanced emphasis on managed care 
we expect this pressure to continue to increase 
we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect such proposals or managed care efforts may have on its business 
however  the announcement of such proposals or efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to raise capital 
further  the adoption of such proposals or efforts would have a material adverse effect on the company and any prospective collaborative partners 
sales of products using the depomed systems in domestic and foreign markets will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  such as government health administration authorities and private health insurers 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of prescription pharmaceutical products 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
accordingly  products using the depomed systems may not be eligible for third party reimbursement at price levels sufficient for us or our collaborative partners to realize appropriate returns on our investments in the depomed systems 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash equivalents are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our cash equivalents would not change by a significant amount 
foreign currency fluctuations we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor did we have any significant balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at december  therefore  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
