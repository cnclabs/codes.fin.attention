koala overview we are a leading designer  producer and worldwide marketer of innovative commercial products  systems and custom solutions that create attractive family friendly environments for businesses and other public venues 
our sales are derived from two business segments  family convenience and children s activity products and children s modular play equipment 
our family convenience and activity products include baby changing stations and high chairs  activity tables  carpets and foam play products 
children s modular play equipment includes indoor and outdoor playground equipment and interactive play equipment used in water parks and family entertainment centers and amusement parks 
we intend to capitalize on brand name recognition established through our market leading koala bear kare baby changing station 
our sales have grown from million in to million in  with sales growth generated by both the acquisition of seven businesses and the internal growth achieved by these businesses during this period 
our sales were derived primarily from the sale of family convenience products  which include baby changing stations  disposable sanitary liners for the baby changing stations  child protection seats  infant seat kradles and booster buddy seats 
one of our strategies has been to reduce our dependence on baby changing stations through the acquisition and development of complementary products 
in furtherance of this strategy  we acquired the following businesses o activities unlimited  a manufacturer of commercial use children s activities products in march  o delta play  a provider of custom children s indoor modular play equipment in june  o park structures  a producer of children s outdoor modular play equipment in december  o superior foam  a manufacturer of children s foam activity products in march  o smart products  a provider of children s safety and parental convenience products in september  o scs  a manufacturer of children s interactive water play equipment in march  and o fibar  a marketer and distributor of playground surfacing systems in august as a result of these acquisitions and introduction of new products  baby changing stations represented less than of our sales in we market our products  systems and custom solutions to a wide range of businesses and public facilities that serve customers and visitors who bring children to their establishments 
we market our products through an integrated program of direct sales and distribution through a network of independent manufacturer s sales representatives and dealers 
since  we have increased our sales and marketing efforts through the addition of manufacturer s sales representatives  dealers and sales representatives 
our gross profit margins are affected by product mix  with the baby changing station and other family convenience products and the children s activity products typically providing higher gross profit margins than the children s modular play equipment 
the children s modular play equipment  however  has higher average selling prices and contributes to our sales growth 
in addition  sales made through dealers provide lower gross profit margins than direct sales due to the expense associated with the manufacturer s sales representatives and dealers 
to the extent we acquire additional companies or product lines  our gross profit margins may be lower than those currently achieved from sales of our current product lines due to a number of factors that may include products with higher average selling prices but lower gross margin percentages 
although our acquisitions have decreased the overall gross profit margins  we believe that the addition of new products and products lines will provide opportunities for revenue diversification and increased long term profitability  while also reducing our reliance on the baby changing station 
components of sales and expense we recognize sales at the time our products are shipped  except for scs  where the percentage of completion method of accounting is used because the build to install timeline of their jobs is of longer duration 
cost of sales consists of components manufactured for us and direct labor and manufacturing overhead incurred by us 
with the exception of the foam activity products  all major components for the family convenience products and children s activity products currently are manufactured and assembled by outside vendors 
direct labor and manufacturing overhead relate to the fabrication and assembly of the modular play products and the manufacture of the foam activity products 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of commissions paid to manufacturer s sales representatives and other selling expenses  executive  sales and office salaries  related payroll taxes  advertising expenses and depreciation on office equipment and computer hardware and software 
we provide limited warranties for our products 
we have experienced minimal returns and warranty claims  and therefore no accrual has been made for future claims except for scs  where a reserve of 
of scs s annual sales has been recorded

sales in the convenience and activity segment accounted for million of the increase 
the smaller contribution by the convenience and activity segment was due primarily to the discontinuance of several children s activity products where gross margins had fallen below the targeted threshold for this segment as well as the effect of the general slowdown in orders during the fourth quarter of due to a softening of the economy  offset by increases in revenues from acquired product lines 
gross profit increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as noted above  the majority of the increase in gross profit resulted from sales of products of the newly acquired businesses 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to of sales in the period compared to of sales in the period primarily because of a change in product mix that included a higher proportion of sales of children s modular play equipment 
the gross profit percentage was also negatively impacted by higher than expected costs incurred in the modular play equipment segment  including cost overruns on several large jobs  higher labor costs incurred in the fourth quarter and the addition of quality assurance personnel for the iso program that was certified in early selling  general and administrative expense increased  or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to of sales in the period compared to in the period primarily due to the addition of sales  legal and engineering personnel and increased product liability insurance premiums incurred as a result of higher levels of product liability insurance coverage

million during the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our worldwide effective rate was primarily due to the inclusion of a number of new state tax jurisdictions and non deductible goodwill as a result of the acquisition of scs  offset by an increase in export sales that qualify for the benefit provided by our foreign sales corporation and a one time net operating loss carryback at delta play

all share quantities and per share amounts have been adjusted for the effect of the for stock split that occurred on october  seasonality and quarterly financial information unaudited our business is seasonal due primarily to the slowdown of new construction and inability to install outdoor modular play equipment during the winter months and the general slowdown of purchasing by retailers during their busy holiday season 
as a result  we typically have lower sales and gross profit in the fourth and first calendar quarters 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly financial information for years ended december  and the information has been derived from unaudited statements of operations data that we believe are stated on a basis consistent with the audited financial statements and include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
during the quarter ended december   we incurred our first quarterly net loss since becoming a public company in as noted in the discussion above  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   this loss was primarily due to the lower level of sales experienced in the fourth quarter combined with cost overruns on several large jobs and higher labor costs incurred in the modular play equipment segment

liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and our acquisitions from cash advanced under our revolving bank line of credit 
cash provided by used in operating activities for and was 
million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by used in operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from funding higher levels of working capital required to support our growth  primarily inventory and overpayment of estimated tax installments during working capital as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and cash balances were 
million for both dates 
the relatively low cash balances are the result of our practice of applying all excess cash against the line of credit to minimize interest expense payable on line of credit balances 
we have used our operating cash flow primarily to expand sales and marketing activities  acquisition and development of new products  capital expenditures and working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in  million was used to purchase scs and fibar 
the balance was primarily devoted to capital expenditures for fixed assets  intellectual property and an advance to one of our officers related to the exercise of stock options in we increased our secured line of credit with a bank from million at december to million on november  the credit facility matures march  loans under the facility are secured by all of our assets 
the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is based on the applicable reserve adjusted libor rate or the commercial bank s prime rate 
at december  the libor rate was while the bank s prime rate was  compared to and at december  there was million outstanding under the credit facility as of december   and million outstanding as of december  although we have used the credit facility primarily for acquisitions  the credit facility is also available for working capital purposes 
we funded the cash portion of the purchase price for both scs and fibar with the revolving credit facility from the bank 
these payments were funded from short term borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe that working capital provided by our cash flow from operations and our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
our backlog of orders is comprised primarily of orders from our customers in the modular play equipment segment 
the amount of backlog at any given point in time will vary due to customers seasonal buying patterns and our production capacity 
the backlog of orders was million at december  and approximately million at december  during  we were not materially affected by changing raw materials prices except for polyethylene prices  which increased materially due to the increase in costs for all petroleum based products experienced in the united states during the year 
during  we intend to take a number of steps to address and support our growth 
these steps include planning for and implementing a new information system that will provide us with the ability to consolidate administrative functions  hiring additional senior management and planning a move to a new facility in that will consolidate manufacturing of some of our product lines and allow us to vertically integrate certain components that are now being manufactured by outside suppliers 
new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued sab  revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we believe our current revenue recognition policy is in compliance with sab in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb fin 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  to the extent that this interpretation covers events occurring during the period after december   or january   but before the effective date of july   the effects of applying this interpretation are recognized on a prospective basis from july  the adoption of fin did not impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates is related primarily to our line of credit  which accrues interest at an adjustable rate 
we do not believe that the future market risks will have material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity  a variance in the interest rate of will result in a change in diluted earnings per share of approximately per share
