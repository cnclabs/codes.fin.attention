asset impairment expense concord acquired a million interest in broadband investment group broadband in september in exchange for our products and services 
in november  broadband publicly announced that it was ceasing operations and liquidating its remaining assets following its inability to raise additional capital due to unfavorable market conditions 
as a result  concord recorded a charge for approximately million to write off its investment in broadband

the effective tax rate approximates the combined statutory rate 
the difference in relates primarily to the use of substantially all of concord s unrestricted net operating loss carryforwards and the reduction of the related valuation allowance 
in addition  we received a tax benefit of approximately  million and  pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options in  and  respectively 
we recorded this benefit as a component of additional paid in capital 
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt the company recognized an extraordinary loss of  net of the related tax benefit of  in related to the early extinguishment of certain debt that the company assumed as a part of the first sense acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources concord has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and a credit line for equipment purchases 
concord had working capital of million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
deferred revenues increased for the year ended december  by million due to an increase in overall sales activity  million of this increase came from deferred maintenance contracts and million was the result of service and software license sales with remaining contingencies such as completion of services  product acceptance and credit worthiness 
investing activities consisted of the acquisition of property and equipment  most notably computer and networking equipment to support the growing employee base and corporate infrastructure and also investments in marketable securities 
concord manages its market risk on its marketable securities by selecting investment grade securities with the highest credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets 
financing activities consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock and exercise of options during  and and the repayment of subordinated debt of firstsense  following the acquisition of this company 
pursuant to the tax reform act of  the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards for tax purposes may be subject to an annual limitation if a cumulative change of ownership of more than occurs over a three year period 
as a result of our preferred stock financings  such a change in ownership has occurred 
as a result of this ownership change  the use of the nol carryforwards will be limited 
we have determined that our initial public offering did not cause another ownership change 
in addition  nol carryforwards acquired as a result of the firstsense acquisition are also restricted as a result of a prior ownership change of firstsense 
concord has deferred tax assets of approximately  composed primarily of nol carryforwards and research and development credits 
we have partially reserved for these deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance of  the net tax asset is based on our estimate of the nol carryforwards we expect to use in the next two years  all other tax assets have been fully reserved 
pursuant to paragraphs to of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  concord considered both positive and negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance at december  and the factors that weighed most heavily on our decision to record a valuation allowance were i the substantial restrictions on the use of certain of its existing nol and credit carryforwards and ii the uncertainty of future profitability 
as a result of our ownership change described above  the future use of approximately  of our nol carryforwards are limited to only  per year  the substantial majority of such nol carry forwards will expire before they can be used 
the firstsense nol carryforwards are limited to million per year 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 we used all of our remaining unrestricted nol and credit carryforwards in computing the tax provision 
as part of the restatement of our financial statements to reflect the firstsense acquisition  we determined that approximately million of valuation allowance previously recorded by firstsense prior to the acquisition was not necessary  given our estimates of future taxable income 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas no 
 we recorded an asset and reduced our provision for income taxes in the period in which such nol carryforwards were generated by firstsense 
we are also subject to rapid technological change  competition from substantially larger competitors  a limited family of products and other related risks 
as a result  we found the evidence described above to be the most reliable objective evidence available in determining that a valuation allowance against our tax assets would be necessary 
concord s nol deferred tax asset includes approximately  pertaining to the benefit associated with the exercise and subsequent disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options by our employees 
when and if we realize this asset  the resulting change in the valuation allowance will be credited directly to additional paid in capital  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
concord received a tax benefit of approximately  million and  in  and  respectively  pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options 
we recorded this benefit as a component of additional paid in capital 
as of december   concord s principal sources of liquidity included cash and marketable securities 
we believe that our current cash and marketable securities and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent concord experiences growth in the future  our operating and investing activities may require significant cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require concord to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
concord does not invest in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
all of our investments are in investment grade securities with high credit ratings of relatively short duration that trade in highly liquid markets and are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  concord has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
concord s primary market risk exposure is in the area of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
substantially all of our business outside the united states is conducted in us dollar denominated transactions  whereas our operating expenses in our international branches are denominated in local currency 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements 
we believe that the operating expenses of our foreign operations are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
concord s current export sales are denominated in united states dollars 
to the extent that international sales continue to be denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products and services more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in international markets
