net sales in aircraft controls increased to million in compared to million in boeing commercial sales increased million due to higher production rates in sales of controls for fighter aircraft  primarily the f a e f for which production levels continued to increase  increased million 
sales also increased million for engine controls  million for aftermarket sales  and million for controls on business aircraft 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales on the b bomber program which has been completed 
operating margins for aircraft controls were in compared to in the improvement in margins primarily resulted from favorable product mix and cost performance on production programs 
additions to contract loss reserves were million in both and  primarily related to business jet development contracts 
twelve month backlog for aircraft controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase was due to increases in backlog for military programs including blackhawk seahawk helicopters and f a e f that outweigh decreases in backlog for commercial aircraft 
space controls 
net sales in space controls decreased to million in from million in a million decrease in sales for launch vehicles  primarily the titan iv program which was completed in fiscal  was partially offset by an increase of million for satellite controls 
operating margins for space controls increased to in from in the improvement in margins is primarily due to cost improvement on newer programs  including the crew return vehicle and various tactical missile programs  as well as increased volume for satellite controls 
twelve month backlog for space controls increased to million at september  from million at september  primarily related to refurbishments on the space shuttle 
industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls increased to million in from million in excluding the impact of a strong us dollar relative to foreign currencies  primarily the euro and the yen  sales would have increased an additional million

cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in compared with in the increase was due primarily to the redeployment of resources in aircraft controls from research and development r d activities to production and  to a lesser extent  lower margins in space controls as a result of the completion of the standard missile ii program in in  million of contract loss reserves were recorded  compared to million in the increase in contract loss reserves primarily occurred within aircraft controls 
inventory valuation provisions were million in and million in r d expenses decreased by million in to million  or of sales 
the decrease was due primarily to reduced efforts for the development of next generation aircraft flight controls which peaked in fiscal a portion of the costs associated with those efforts has been redirected to either production or sales support 
interest expense increased million in to million 
three quarters of the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding borrowings on variable rate indebtedness  resulting primarily from the financing of the first quarter acquisitions

space controls 
net sales in space controls increased to million in compared to million in sales of flight controls for the space shuttle and space station crew return vehicle increased million while sales on the titan iv launch vehicle program increased million  primarily related to work performed earlier in increased sales of tactical missile controls for the agm of million and hellfire of million helped offset sales declines of million on the standard missile ii program which was completed in operating margins for space controls decreased to in from in the decline in margins was attributable to the shift from more mature programs such as standard missile ii to development programs such as national missile defense  space station crew return vehicle and newer satellite propulsion and tactical missile programs 
twelve month backlog for space controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the decrease was primarily due to the titan iv program nearing completion 
industrial controls 
net sales in industrial controls increased to million in from million in had foreign currencies not weakened against the us dollar  sales would have translated into an additional million over sales for turbine controls increased by million and sales of controls for plastics machinery increased by million 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decline in sales of combat controls and a million decrease for electric motion simulators due to the completion of universal s spiderman theme park attraction 
operating margins increased to in compared to in due to improved operating efficiencies related to higher sales volume 
twelve month backlog for industrial controls was million at september  compared to million at september  the increase primarily related to growth in the turbines and simulation businesses 
financial condition and liquidity on october   the company amended its million corporate revolving and term loan agreement credit facility 
the term loan portion of the credit facility  which had a balance of million at september   was increased to million with the difference added to the unused borrowing capacity of the revolving portion of the facility

at september   the company had million of unused borrowing capacity under short and long term lines of credit  including million from the credit facility 
total debt increased to million at september  from million at september  increased debt from acquisitions of million was partially offset by repayments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million a year ago 
the increase in cash from operations was primarily due to the increase in earnings adjusted for non cash charges 
the company expects cash from operations in to be comparable with net property  plant and equipment was million at september  compared to million at september  capital expenditures in were million compared with depreciation and amortization of million

recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale 
the company must adopt this standard by fiscal the company is evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation will be recorded in the period in which it is incurred  and the carrying amount of the related long lived asset will be increased 
over time  the liability will be accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost will be depreciated over the asset s useful life 
a gain or loss will be recorded if necessary upon settlement of the liability 
the company must adopt this standard by fiscal the company is evaluating the effect that this standard will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 all business combinations are to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are to be recognized separately from goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be reviewed for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are to be amortized over their useful lives unless their useful lives are indefinite  in which case  those intangible assets will be tested for impairment annually and not amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
these standards are effective for all business combinations completed after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   companies are required to adopt sfas no 
for fiscal years beginning after december   but early adoption is permitted 
the company expects to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company is evaluating the effect that adoption of these statements will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of this sab did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
outlook net sales in fiscal are forecasted to grow to million  a increase over fiscal sales are forecasted to increase in each of the company s segments 
aircraft controls sales are forecasted to increase to million  primarily as a result of increases in military business  particularly aftermarket sales and sales related to the company s effort in the development phase of the new f joint strike fighter recently awarded to lockheed martin 
offsetting these increases within the aircraft controls segment will be a decline in commercial aircraft sales  particularly related to sales to boeing and the related aftermarket sales  as a result of the september  terrorist attacks 
space controls sales are forecasted to increase to million  primarily related to growth in the satellite business and increased activity on nasa s space shuttle 
industrial controls sales are forecasted to increase to million  primarily due to having a full year of revenues from the radial piston pump product line  which was acquired in february  and increases related to combat vehicles 
operating margins for fiscal are expected to decline slightly to approximately as a result of softness in the industrial plastics market and margin pressures in the turbines market 
after consideration of the impact of the equity offering and eliminating the amortization of goodwill assuming the adoption of sfas no 
 fiscal earnings per share is estimated to be 
on september   the united states was attacked by terrorists using hijacked commercial airline jets 
the effect of these tragic events on general economic conditions and on the commercial airline industry  in particular  could be significant 
for example  the events have resulted and could continue to result in a decreased demand for air travel due to fears regarding additional acts of terrorism 
these events could also result in an increase in the price of jet fuel because of concerns regarding hostilities in the middle east and airlines bearing increased costs or reducing operations due to new security directives adopted by the federal aviation administration 
at this time  the company is unable to predict with certainty the impact that these events will have on its commercial aircraft business and thus on this outlook 
the company believes that its diverse revenue base and its global geographic presence will help to lessen the impact of any decrease in its commercial aircraft sales 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of business  has exposures to interest rate risks from its long term debt obligations and foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
to minimize these risks  the company may enter into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which requires companies to carry all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether is has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  the reason for holding it 
for the year ended september   the company s exposure to derivatives was primarily limited to interest rate swaps that were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s borrowings under variable interest rate facilities were million at september  in order to provide for interest rate protection  the company has interest rate swap agreements totaling million  of which million matures at various times during fiscal and effectively converts this amount to fixed rate debt at 
the remaining million matures at various times during fiscal and effectively converts this amount to fixed rate debt at 
if interest rates had increased by one percentage point  the impact on consolidated interest expense from the company s variable rate debt would have been approximately million in the majority of the company s sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars 
the company does have some market risk exposure with respect to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as it relates to the value of the us dollar versus the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
if foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken against the us dollar by  net earnings would be reduced by approximately million related to currency exchange rate translation exposures and million related to pressures on operating margins for products sourced in non us countries 
the company occasionally uses forward contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw material purchases  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans and to reduce fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in  and long term advances to  subsidiaries 
at september   there were no significant contracts outstanding
