market risk at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts to sell million of euros

the net assets of the company s foreign subsidiaries at december  totaled million 
the potential loss in net assets resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to million

the legacy currencies will remain in effect until july   at which time  the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender for any transactions
