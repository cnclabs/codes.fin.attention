gross margin 
the company s overall gross margin in was million  or  compared to million  or  in the increase in gross margin in of million was attributable in part to restructuring charges of million taken in and non restructuring charges of million taken in  partially offset by million in non restructuring charges taken in  plus an increased mix of higher margin zip mb drives the majority of which are sold as higher margin aftermarket products  lower material and manufacturing costs in all product lines and a million reversal of reserves related to prior zip rebate programs as discussed above 
the million restructuring charge in was composed of million related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with discontinuing the buz multimedia producer and a jaz development project and million of restructuring charges related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with clik product streamlining 
the million of non restructuring charges was composed of charges taken during the second  third and fourth quarters of  of million  million and million  respectively for a more detailed explanation of the non restructuring charges  see the subsection entitled non restructuring charges in the as compared to section 
the million of non restructuring charges taken in is explained below 
increases in gross margin in were partially offset by product price reductions and rebate programs 
future gross margin percentages will be impacted by the sales mix between aftermarket and oem channels  as oem sales generally provide lower gross margins than sales through other channels  and by the sales mix of zip mb and zip mb drives and disks 
future gross margins will also vary depending on sales volumes of zip  jaz and pocketzip disks  which generate significantly higher gross margins than the corresponding drives  the mix between disks and drives  the mix between zip  jaz  iomega cd rw and pocketzip products  any future pricing actions or promotions  the success of recently introduced products such as hipzip and fotoshow  and potential start up costs associated with introducing new products  including peerless 
non restructuring charges 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million as cost of sales 
the charges were comprised of million for excess pocketzip disk manufacturing capacity  million to reflect a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of pocketzip pc card drive inventory  million for excess pocketzip pc card drive manufacturing capacity and million for pocketzip pc card drive purchase commitments 
the million excess pocketzip disk manufacturing capacity was due to the company not achieving or expecting to achieve its overall disk volumes 
as a result  undiscounted future cash flows were not expected to enable recovery of the carrying value of the equipment 
the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
the company includes material costs  manufacturing costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
the million in pocketzip pc card drive inventory charges was due to a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of pocketzip pc card drives because expected undiscounted cash flows would not enable recovery of costs 
segment product profit margin excluding restructuring reversals charges 
zip segment product profit margin in of million  increased by million  or in  when compared to zip product profit margin of million in product profit margin as a percentage of zip sales increased to in  compared to in the increase was due primarily to an increased mix of higher margin zip mb products  lower overall material and variable overhead costs of million  lower operating expenses of million and a million reversal of reserves related to prior zip rebate programs as discussed above 
these margin improvements were partially offset by lower overall drive and disk units shipped  price reductions and various rebate programs conducted throughout the year to stimulate sales 
jaz segment product profit margin in of million increased by million  or  compared to jaz product profit margin of million 
product profit margin as a percentage of jaz sales increased to in  compared to in this increase resulted primarily from million in lower material and manufacturing costs and million in lower operating expenses when compared to these lower expenses reflect the cost savings from the restructuring actions taken in june by closing the milpitas  california facility and discontinuing certain development projects 
these margin improvements were partially offset by lower shipments of drives and disks and from price reductions 
iomega cd rw segment had a million product loss  or of iomega cd rw sales in  compared to a product loss of million  or of iomega cd rw sales in the losses were due primarily to product development and launch costs incurred as the company introduced several new cd rw drives during the company began shipping iomega cd rw products in limited quantities during august this segment has lower margins than the company s other segments due to the company manufacturing only a small percentage of the drives being sold 
iomega cd rw margins benefited from increased volume  with manufacturing costs being reduced by million 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses of million resulting from new product launches and higher marketing costs 
pocketzip segment product loss of million for  or almost times pocketzip sales  decreased million compared to a million loss in  or in excess of times pocketzip sales 
the reduced product loss in was primarily due to lower cost of sales during of million and lower operating expenses of million 
the lower cost of sales in primarily resulted from non restructuring charges in of million recorded in cost of sales  of which million  million and million were recorded in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  which were offset in part by a million non restructuring charge in to reflect a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of inventory and equipment 
the non restructuring charges in were comprised of million for excess and obsolete inventory  reduction in the estimated net realizable value of inventory and supplier commitments to purchase additional inventory  and million for excess manufacturing equipment for a more detailed explanation of the non restructuring charges  see the subsection entitled non restructuring charges in the as compared to section 
operating expenses were lower in due to lower marketing costs and research and development expenditures 
ditto segment product loss of million for represented a million  or improvement over s million product loss 
in march  the company sold certain assets associated with its ditto segment  including intellectual property  exclusive manufacturing rights  software  equipment  brand names and product logos 
the company continued to sell its ditto finished drives through june and continues to sell ditto cartridges and certain ditto finished drives in accordance with the agreement entered into with the purchaser of the ditto assets 
general corporate expenses that were not allocated to product profit margin were million in  an increase of million or  compared to million in the increase in unallocated corporate expenses resulted primarily from higher common sales and marketing expenses which increased by million compared to due to increased use of professional services  increased expenditures associated with the higher sales and marketing headcount and increased marketing expenditures to raise corporate brand awareness 
the remainder of the increase in general corporate expenditures was primarily from higher product management expenditures and bonus accruals in selling  general and administrative expenses including bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses including bad debt expense of million for decreased by million  or  compared to  but increased as a percentage of sales from in to in the lower expenditures for were primarily from decreased sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively 
the lower sales and marketing expenses resulted from million in lower product management expenses and million in lower non advertising related sales and marketing expenditures that were partially offset by a million increase in advertising expenditures 
included in the million decrease in non advertising related sales and marketing expenditures was a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the company recorded a million bad debt credit or reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts in compared to a million bad debt expense or increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts in was a result of improved trade receivable agings due to collection of older receivables  lower overall trade receivables and recovery on specific accounts previously deemed uncollectable 
at december   the company had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  the million in higher advertising expenditures resulted primarily from the company s television advertising campaign during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses of million for decreased by million  or  when compared to and decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in this decrease was primarily the result of lower spending on pocketzip other than hipzip  jaz and zip other than fotoshow projects partially offset by development costs associated with hipzip  fotoshow  software and peerless projects 
restructuring reversals charges 
during  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  as a result of steps the company was taking to organize along functional lines  consolidate manufacturing and other facilities  discontinue certain products and refocus the clik product platform on the newer clik pc card and oem drives 
the restructuring actions included as part of these restructuring charges are detailed below under the heading as compared to restructuring charges 
of the million in total pre tax restructuring charges  million related to inventory and inventory commitments and was recorded in cost of sales in the financial statements 
the million charge was composed of million related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with discontinuing the buz multimedia producer and a jaz development project and million of restructuring charges related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with clik product streamlining 
the remaining million was reported separately in the financial statements 
of the million of pre tax restructuring charges  million was recorded in the second quarter of  of which million was reversed in the fourth quarter of  and million and million in restructuring charges were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
during  the company reversed million of these restructuring charges as explained in more detail below 
second quarter restructuring actions activity changes in reserves 
the second quarter restructuring reserves originally totaled million  of which million was reversed in the fourth quarter of remaining restructuring reserves in the amount of million and million are included in the company s balance sheets as of december   and  respectively  in inventory reserves  fixed asset reserves and liabilities 
utilization of the second quarter restructuring reserves during the year ended december  is summarized below utilized balance balance cash non cash reversals in thousands second quarter restructuring actions discontinued products projects manufacturing equipment tooling a    inventory a purchase commitments b severance and benefits b   leasehold improvements furniture a   lease terminations b   france scotland consolidation contract obligations b c   severance and benefits b lease cancellations b leasehold improvements furniture a other exit costs a balance sheet breakout inventory reserves a fixed asset reserves a    liabilities b     a amounts represent primarily non cash charges 
b amounts represent primarily cash charges 
c amounts relate to commitments associated with the manufacturing of floppy drives 
during the second quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the discontinuance of development projects 
the excess restructuring reserves were a result of negotiating reductions in purchase commitments or cancellation charges on inventory and vendor equipment and higher than expected proceeds from equipment disposals 
during the third quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the closure of facilities in milpitas  california 
the excess restructuring reserves were a result of the company being able to terminate a lease earlier than originally anticipated and the company being able to sublease certain of the facilities at higher rates than had been anticipated 
as of december   all of the restructuring reserves associated with the second quarter us restructuring actions have been utilized which included disposal of equipment  tooling and inventory and payment of purchase commitments associated with discontinued products and development projects  disposal of furniture and leasehold improvements and payment of leases associated with the shutdown of the san diego and milpitas  california facilities  payment of severance and benefits in the united states and disposition of all france and scotland assets and liabilities except for the contract obligations 
the contract obligations in france remain under dispute and therefore have not been settled 
second half restructuring actions activity changes in reserves 
the second half restructuring reserves originally totaled million 
remaining restructuring reserves in the amount of million and million are included in the company s balance sheets as of december   and  respectively  in liabilities  fixed asset reserves  inventory reserves  and trade receivables 
utilization of the second half restructuring reserves during the year ended december  is summarized below utilized balance balance cash non cash reversals in thousands second half restructuring actions manufacturing cessation avranches  france equipment and fixtures a   inventory a trade receivables a other commitments b c  contract obligations b   severance and benefits b   clik product streamlining manufacturing equipment a   purchase commitments b  longmont  colorado severance and benefits b balance sheet breakout liabilities b    fixed asset reserves a    inventory reserves a trade receivables a a amounts represent primarily non cash charges 
b amounts represent primarily cash charges 
c represents accruals for shut down costs  taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities 
during the second quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring charges associated with clik product streamlining as a result of the company negotiating reductions in purchase commitments 
during the third quarter of  the company reversed million of restructuring reserves associated with the clik product streamlining 
due to the development during the third quarter of of the company s hipzip digital audio player  it was determined that certain clik manufacturing equipment  previously reserved in the third quarter of as part of the second half restructuring reserves  could be utilized in the company s penang facility 
utilization of reserves associated with the second half restructuring actions within the united states was completed during  which included the disposal of equipment and payment of purchase commitments associated with clik product streamlining and severance payments to longmont  colorado employees 
the legal requirements in france relating to workforce reductions are very strict and the social plan approved for the workforce can take up to two years to fully administrate 
therefore  the restructuring reserves related to manufacturing cessation in avranches  france will take longer to utilize 
there can be no assurance that the company s cessation of manufacturing operations in france will not result in significant legal or other costs that have not been accrued for in the restructuring charges 
the company is currently undergoing a tax audit in france 
the audit covers payroll and benefits  corporate income taxes and vat value added tax 
it is too early to assess the outcome of this audit 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur claims or assessments from this audit that have not been accrued 
interest and other income and expense 
the company recorded interest income of million in  compared to million in  due to higher average available cash  cash equivalent and temporary investment balances in interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense resulted mainly from lower average debt balances in that resulted from paying off the million related party notes in march and the million convertible subordinated notes in october as of december   the company does not have any debt other than capital lease obligations of million 
included in other income and expense were bank charges  miscellaneous royalty income  gains and losses on disposal of assets and foreign currency gains and losses 
income taxes 
for  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  reflecting an income tax provision of million on pre tax income of million  offset by a million decrease in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
this compares to an income tax provision of million in reflecting an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  offset by a million increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the provision of million  excluding the million decrease in the valuation allowance  differs by million from the provision of million computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the pre tax income of million  primarily due to the tax effect of state income taxes 
the million decrease in the valuation allowance reflects a decrease in deferred tax assets of million  an increase in deferred tax liabilities of million and the determination that a valuation allowance was no longer required for net deferred tax assets of million at december   related to domestic operations 
a number of factors  including several consecutive quarters of consolidated and us pre tax profitability  led to a higher degree of confidence in the company s ability to realize the net deferred tax assets of million at december  during the first two quarters of  the company utilized the discrete method  as outlined in footnote to paragraph of interpretation to apb opinion no 
 to record its quarterly tax provisions 
the discrete method requires the company to use its actual year to date tax rate at the end of each quarter as its estimated annual effective tax rate 
the discrete method was used during the first two quarters of because the company concluded that it could not reasonably estimate an effective tax rate for the year the company s expected pre tax results and the extent  to which valuation allowances previously established would increase or decrease  depended on a number of different factors the impact of which was not predictable 
at the end of the third quarter  based on a variety of factors including those discussed in the preceding paragraph  the company concluded that it no longer needed to maintain a valuation allowance against its us net deferred tax assets 
additionally  the company concluded at the end of the third quarter that a reasonable estimate of the full year effective tax rate could be made 
accordingly  the company changed its approach for recording income taxes from using the discrete method to using an estimated annual effective tax rate 
at december   the company had total deferred tax assets of million related to foreign and domestic operations 
these total deferred tax assets reflect the tax benefit of temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the total deferred tax assets were reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million and by a valuation allowance of million 
the company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which reflect the tax benefit of approximately million in future tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in these deferred tax assets remain fully valued because their realization is dependent on earning future foreign taxable income in the tax jurisdictions to which the net operating loss carryforwards relate 
the largest of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards relates to the company s french subsidiary  nomai sa this subsidiary s operations have been shut down  and therefore  the foreign net operating loss carryforward related to nomai sa is not likely to be realized in the future 
as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  including million of deferred tax assets related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards  which reflect the tax benefit of approximately million in future domestic tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in the remaining million of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  reflects the tax benefit of approximately million in future domestic tax deductions 
the company anticipates that its effective tax rate for will approximate the us federal and state statutory rates 
as compared to sales 
sales for of  million decreased by million  or  compared to this decrease was due primarily to lower sales volumes of jaz and ditto products as well as price reductions and rebates primarily related to zip products 
lower jaz and ditto sales were partially offset by revenue from the new clik and zipcd products and slightly higher zip sales 
total drive unit shipments increased by over  yet revenues decreased by to million as a result of price reductions 
total disk unit shipments increased by over  yet revenues decreased by to million as a result of price reductions 
the price reductions and rebates for zip products were largely the result of the company s strategy to gain increased market penetration for its zip products 
sales of zip products in each of and totaled approximately billion and accounted for of total sales in  as compared with of total sales in the company s zip drive unit shipments increased by from as lower zip mb oem drive shipments were more than offset by increased zip mb drive shipments 
zip disk unit shipments increased by driven by higher zip mb disk units shipped 
the increase in both disk and drive units shipped was partially offset by lower prices on zip mb drives and disks 
zip oem drive units shipped by iomega accounted for over of total zip drive shipments in  compared to approximately in higher units shipped and a more favorable product mix accounted for a million increase in revenue as compared to but were substantially offset by pricing actions of million 
in the first half of  the company experienced an increase of approximately million in zip returns in its international operations due primarily to significant european customers returning zip products that the customers did not sell during the holiday season 
however  the returns did not have an impact on overall net sales since revenue had not been recognized at december  for estimated excess channel inventory 
jaz product sales in totaled million  or of total sales  representing a decrease from jaz drive unit shipments decreased by from  while jaz disk unit shipments decreased by 
lower units shipped  net of favorable product mix  accounted for a million decrease in revenue and pricing actions accounted for an million decrease in revenue compared to zipcd products began shipping in limited quantities in august and totaled million or of sales for the year ended december  sales primarily consisted of drives 
clik product sales totaled million in  as compared to million  in the company began shipping clik products in limited quantities in december the clik pc card drive began shipping in limited quantities in june ditto product sales in were million  or of total sales  representing a decline from in march  the company sold certain assets and rights associated with its ditto product line 
reduced units shipped accounted for substantially all of the million decrease in revenue 
the company continued to sell its ditto finished drives through june  and continued to sell ditto cartridges and certain ditto finished drives in accordance with the agreement entered into with the purchaser of the ditto assets 
geographically  sales in the americas were approximately billion in  as compared to billion in and accounted for of total sales in  as compared with of total sales in the decrease in was primarily a result of lower zip  jaz and ditto sales  partially offset by clik and zipcd sales 
sales in europe were million  or of total sales  in  as compared to million  or of total sales  in the decrease in was primarily a result of lower jaz and ditto sales partially offset by increased zip  zipcd and clik sales 
sales in asia were million  or of total sales  in  as compared to million  or of total sales  in as the asian economy began to recover 
gross margin 
the company s overall gross margin was million  or  in  as compared to million  or  in the decrease in gross margin of million in was due primarily to million of restructuring charges composed of million related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with discontinuing the buz multimedia producer and a jaz development project and million of restructuring charges related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with clik product streamlining  and non restructuring charges of million  million and million taken in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  as well as lower units shipped of jaz and ditto products see discussion below for detail of the non restructuring charges 
exclusive of the impact of these charges  the company s overall gross margin increased million on lower sales 
this increase was due to lower component material costs and per unit manufacturing overhead costs for the zip and jaz product lines and an increased sales mix of zip mb drives 
non restructuring charges 
during the fourth  third and second quarters of  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million  million  and million  respectively 
during  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million in selling  general and administrative expenses and million in cost of sales 
a breakdown of the charges is included in the table below description of non restructuring charges amount financial statement category in millions q excess clik pc card drive inventory cost of sales supplier claim for clik pc card drive inventory cost of sales excess clik pc card drive equipment cost of sales clik disk inventory nrv cost of sales clik digital camera bundle inventory cost of sales q excess ditto finished drive inventory cost of sales zip and jaz remanufactured drive components cost of sales excess clik disk manufacturing equipment and other equipment cost of sales european bad debt sg a q excess jaz manufacturing equipment cost of sales clik mobile drive inventory nrv cost of sales employee severance sg a leasehold improvements sg a cancellation charges sg a excess ditto inventory components cost of sales nrv net realizable value sg a selling  general and administrative expenses the million of non restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of were all related to the company s clik family of products and was comprised of million for excess inventory on hand  million for a supplier commitment to purchase additional inventory  and million in excess manufacturing equipment which represented the carrying value of the equipment associated with the clik pc card drive  million associated with a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik disks  and million associated with excess inventory and a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of the clik digital camera bundle 
the million supplier commitment related to clik pc card drive inventory which the supplier had manufactured for the company and the company was required to purchase 
since the company already had clik pc card drive inventory on hand that was considered excess  the million was reserved 
the company began shipping the clik pc card drive in limited quantities in june during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it had over estimated demand for the product in the market  which created inventory recoverability issues and probable losses associated with non cancelable purchase orders 
the lower volume of drives being sold in the market also impacted clik disk volume and therefore  created inventory recoverability issues associated with clik disks  resulting in a reduction of the net realizable value of clik disk inventory 
the charges associated with the clik digital camera bundle inventory resulted from the fact that during the fourth quarter  the company had to abandon its plans to sell its remaining clik digital camera bundle inventory because a discontinued component by a vendor made it impossible to complete final assembly 
at december   the clik digital camera bundle inventory described above had been disposed 
the clik pc card drive and disk inventory is continuing to be sold near breakeven 
these charges were reflected in cost of sales in the financial statements 
the million of non restructuring charges recorded in the third quarter of was comprised of million for excess ditto finished drive inventory  million for excess and obsolete zip and jaz remanufactured drive component inventory  million of charges for excess clik disk manufacturing equipment and other equipment and a bad debt write off related to a european customer collection issue 
the million of fixed asset and inventory charges described above were reflected in cost of sales and the million bad debt write off was reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the financial statements 
the million in ditto finished drive inventory charges was a result of excess ditto finished drives that the company was no longer allowed to sell as a result of a contract entered into during the first quarter of in connection with the sale of the ditto assets 
the buyer who had purchased certain ditto assets in the first quarter of was expected to purchase the remaining ditto finished drive inventory at the company s carrying value in the third quarter 
however  in the third quarter  the buyer informed the company that it did not have the financial ability to purchase the remaining ditto finished drives 
at december   the majority of the ditto finished drives were still on hand 
at december   the company had disposed of the majority of these remaining ditto finished drives 
the million charge for excess and obsolete zip and jaz remanufactured drive components was taken as a result of lower demand from customers for remanufactured drives and an increase in the available number of remanufactured drives created by returned drives from retail customers 
in addition  the company changed its process for handling warranty drives during the third quarter of which created excess and obsolete components 
at december   the majority of these components had been scrapped 
the million of charges for excess clik disk manufacturing equipment and other equipment were primarily the result of the company not achieving its anticipated drive volumes that resulted in a decline in overall disk volumes 
as a consequence  future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to cover the net book value of the applicable assets 
the million of non restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of was comprised of million for excess jaz manufacturing equipment and million for a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik mobile drive inventory 
the company evaluates excess capacity of manufacturing equipment on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the second quarter review  a charge of million was taken for excess jaz manufacturing equipment 
this excess equipment was created in the second quarter due to a decline in the estimated demand for jaz products in the second quarter and future quarters  which demonstrated future undiscounted cash flow losses associated with the assets 
the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices 
the company includes material costs  manufacturing costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
the million in clik mobile drive inventory charges were due to a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik mobile drives because expected undiscounted cash flows would not cover material costs  manufacturing costs and direct selling expenses due to a decline in demand 
the clik platform was relatively new  and it did not start shipping in volumes until the first quarter of at december   the majority of the clik mobile drive units had been scrapped or used as warranty replacement units 
these charges were reflected in cost of sales in the financial statements 
during  the company recorded a non restructuring charge of million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the million represented expenses associated with cost reduction measures implemented by the company to improve financial performance and included million of employee severance and outplacement charges associated with the expected termination of regular employees 
these employees were associated with all levels of operations  product management  research and development and selling  general and administrative functions 
in addition  the company expected to terminate the services of temporary employees and contractors 
the charge also included million of cash and non cash write offs for facility related assets associated with facilities primarily located in roy  utah and million of cancellation charges related to pre paid marketing costs  primarily tradeshows 
as a result of individuals voluntarily leaving the company during the period of the layoffs  the company terminated fewer regular employees than originally identified

however  the lower severance and benefits costs of million were more than offset by higher than expected facility costs of million 
the million non restructuring charge recorded during in cost of sales was for excess ditto inventory components

segment product profit margin excluding restructuring charges 
zip segment product profit margin of million  or of sales  increased by million  or  in when compared to zip product profit margin of million  or of sales 
this increase was primarily due to an increased mix of higher margin zip mb products and lower overall material and variable overhead costs 
jaz segment product profit margin of million  or of jaz sales  increased by million  or in excess of  in when compared to jaz product profit margin of million  or of sales 
the increase in product profit margin was due to decreased material  manufacturing and operating costs and an increased mix of higher margin jaz gb products 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in jaz drive and disk unit sales and reserves recorded in to effect excess manufacturing capacity relating to jaz products 
clik segment product loss increased to million  or in excess of times sales  from a clik product loss of million  or in excess of times sales 
the increase in segment product loss was due to a combination of sales and marketing product launch costs  manufacturing startup costs  and non restructuring charges of million  million and million recorded in cost of sales in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
the million charge in the second quarter represented a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik mobile drive inventory 
the million charge in the third quarter was related to excess clik disk manufacturing equipment 
the million charge was comprised of million for excess inventory on hand  million for a supplier commitment to purchase additional inventory  and million in excess manufacturing equipment associated with the clik pc card drive  million associated with a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik disk inventory and million associated with excess inventory and a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of the clik digital camera bundle 
the million supplier commitment related to clik pc card drive inventory which the supplier had manufactured for the company and the company was required to purchase 
since the company already had clik pc card drive inventory on hand that was considered excess  the million was reserved 
the company began shipping the clik pc card drives in limited quantities in june during the fourth quarter  the company determined that it had over estimated the initial demand for the product in the market  which created inventory recoverability issues and probable losses associated with non cancelable purchase orders 
in addition  the lower volume of drives being sold in the market impacted the disk volume  and therefore created inventory valuation issues associated with clik disk inventory  resulting in a reduction in the estimated net realizable value of clik disk inventory 
the charges associated with the clik digital camera bundle inventory resulted from the fact that during the fourth quarter the company had to abandon its plans to sell its remaining clik digital camera bundle inventory because a discontinued component by a vendor made it impossible to complete final assembly 
zipcd segment had a product loss of million  or of sales  due primarily to product development and launch costs incurred as the company began shipping zipcd products in limited quantities in august ditto segment product loss of million  or of sales  decreased slightly compared to ditto segment product loss of million  or of sales 
the decrease was due to lower operating costs partially offset by a decrease in volumes of ditto products sold in ditto units shipped decreased in due to the company selling certain assets such as trade names and ditto drive manufacturing components and equipment in march the ditto segment product loss of million included a charge of million taken in the third quarter of related to excess ditto finished drive inventory 
the ditto segment product loss of million included a charge of million in to reflect excess inventory components 
during  the company decided to stop manufacturing and marketing ditto products due to lower consumer demand for tape products 
when the company made the decision to discontinue manufacturing  the company shortened its estimated useful life on the ditto manufacturing assets to the amount of time the assets would be utilized in the final build out of finished drives 
selling  general and administrative expenses including bad debt expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses including bad debt expense of million for decreased by million compared to  and decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in the decreased expenses in were primarily due to a combination of decreased advertising program expenditures of million  decreased spending on other non advertising related sales and marketing activities of million  decreased spending on product management activities primarily due to reorganizing along functional lines and other restructuring actions of million  decreased spending on customer satisfaction programs of million as a result of increased product quality and productivity gained through the use of the internet and a decrease in other general and administrative expenses of million  comprised mainly of information system expenditures of million and legal fees of million 
also accounting for a portion of the decline in selling  general and administrative expense in was a non restructuring charge of million taken in the million represented expenses associated with cost reduction measures implemented by the company to improve financial performance and included million of employee severance and outplacement charges associated with the expected termination of regular employees 
these employees were associated with all levels of operations  product management  research and development and selling  general and administrative functions 
in addition  the company expected to terminate the services of temporary employees and contractors 
the charge also included million of cash and non cash write offs for facility related assets associated with facilities primarily located in roy  utah and million of cancellation charges related to pre paid marketing costs  primarily tradeshows 
as a result of individuals voluntarily leaving the company during the period of the layoffs  the company terminated fewer regular employees than originally identified 
the company ultimately terminated the employment of regular employees 
however  the lower severance and benefits costs of million were more than offset by higher than expected facility costs of million 
the foregoing decreases were partially offset by a million increase in bad debt expense primarily as a result of a deterioration of trade receivable agings in europe and reserves for specific customer accounts 
the european trade receivable agings began deteriorating in the beginning of the fourth quarter of when the european collections manager left the company 
at december   the company had million in trade receivables in excess of days past due compared to million at december  the reserves for specific customer accounts included million of reserves for collection problems with a large european customer and million of reserves for collection problems with a us customer 
the million bad debt provision for the us customer was recorded in the fourth quarter of and fully reserved the customer s outstanding trade receivables balance at december  the reserve was recorded as a result of the customer missing payments during the fourth quarter and confirmation by the company during the fourth quarter that the customer was experiencing serious cash flow problems 
in connection with the european customer  the company recorded a specific bad debt provision of approximately million in the second quarter of due to the customer missing agreed upon payments  which represented a partial reserve on the outstanding receivable balance 
in the third quarter of  the company accrued an additional million to increase the partial reserve on the customer s outstanding receivable balance as a result of further collection problems 
in the fourth quarter of  the customer made no payments on its account 
therefore  the company provided an additional million in bad debt reserves to fully reserve the customer s trade receivables balance at december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses of million for decreased by million  or  when compared to  and decreased as a percentage of sales to in  from in this decrease was primarily the result of decreased spending on clik development and the discontinuance of a next generation jaz product during in  the company had significant expenditures relating to clik which began shipping in december restructuring charges during  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  as a result of steps the company was taking to organize along functional lines  consolidate manufacturing and other facilities  discontinue certain products and refocus the clik product platform on the newer clik pc card and oem drives 
of the million  million related to inventory and inventory commitments and was recorded in cost of sales in the financial statements 
the million charge was composed of million related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with discontinuing the buz multimedia producer and a jaz development project and million of restructuring charges related to inventory and inventory commitments associated with clik product streamlining 
the remaining million was recorded separately in the financial statements

the consolidation of operations in france and scotland resulted in the closure of a sales office in paris  france and a research facility in scotland 
this restructuring charge consisted of cash and non cash charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
there were not any indications of permanent impairment of the assets prior to the restructuring actions 
the company estimated that annual cost savings may approximate million when these actions have been fully implemented 
the savings are primarily a result of reductions in salaries  rent and depreciation 
however  it was also anticipated that these savings would be offset by increased spending in other areas such as advertising 
the second quarter restructuring reserves originally totaled million of which million was reversed in the fourth quarter of as discussed below 
remaining restructuring reserves in the amount of million are included in the company s balance sheet as of december   in inventory reserves  fixed asset reserves and liabilities

the majority of the manufacturing equipment tooling associated with the discontinued products and projects were tooling items located at vendors outside of the united states 
due to various requirements in these countries  it has taken longer than expected to dispose of these assets 
these fixed assets have not been utilized since the restructuring actions were announced 
the company planned on terminating the employment of individuals in connection with the second quarter restructuring actions 
the company pays severance on a continuous basis as opposed to a lump sum payment 
several of the employees in california were offered retention packages requiring them to continue to work for the company into the third or fourth quarters of  and therefore  their severance pay did not begin until later in the retention packages were offered to individuals at all levels of development and administrative functions necessary to transfer product and process knowledge to roy  utah and close down the facilities in milpitas and san diego  california 
these retention costs totaled million and were included in the severance charge 
through december   the company had terminated regular and temporary employees  consisting primarily of operations and product development employees located in milpitas and san diego  california and roy  utah  sales personnel located in paris  france and product development employees located in scotland 
due to attrition and a strong job market  a number of positions planned for elimination were voluntarily vacated  which resulted in a million reversal of severance and benefit reserves in the fourth quarter of the milpitas and san diego facilities  each of which consisted of multiple leased properties  were vacated during the third quarter of the related leasehold improvements and furniture were no longer utilized after the facilities were vacated 
depreciation and rent were charged to normal operations until the facilities were vacated 
at december   the company expected most of the remaining restructuring reserves to be utilized by the end of the first quarter of  with the remainder being completed in the second and third quarters of the contract obligations in france remain under dispute and therefore have not been settled 
second half restructuring actions activity changes in reserves 
during the third quarter ended september   the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million as a result of restructuring actions initiated to consolidate worldwide clik disk manufacturing and refocus the clik product platform on the newer clik pc card and oem drives which resulted in the company s discontinuance of the clik mobile drive

an additional charge of million  primarily for severance and benefits and write offs of other prepaid administrative expenses related to the shutdown of avranches  was taken in the fourth quarter of in connection with the cessation of the avranches  france operations where clik disks were manufactured 
the second half restructuring charges totaled million and included reserves of million related to the cessation of manufacturing in avranches  france 
these costs were comprised of operating assets such as fixed assets  receivables and inventory  a million charge for a write off of intangibles and exit costs including contract obligations associated with service contracts associated with the avranches operations 
the million write off of intangibles represented the unamortized amount of the original million associated with other nomai products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the second half restructuring charges also included reserves of million of inventory and fixed asset reserves associated with the clik mobile drive products and million for the write off of prepaid royalty and development charges and severance and benefit accruals associated with the longmont  colorado operations where research and development activities were performed 
these restructuring charges consisted of cash and non cash charges of approximately million and million  respectively

operations ceased in avranches  france during october as of december   the company ceased all operations  ceased utilization of all facilities and fixed assets and terminated all employees except for a few employees necessary to wind up the company s affairs 
in connection with the company s second half restructuring actions  the company had a workforce reduction of approximately regular and temporary employees  consisting primarily of operations employees in avranches  france and product development employees in longmont  colorado 
the company had originally estimated the termination of employees 
the legal requirements in france relating to workforce reductions are very strict and the social plan approved for the workforce can take up to two years to fully administrate 
therefore  the restructuring reserves related to manufacturing cessation in avranches  france will take longer to utilize 
there can be no assurance that the company s cessation of manufacturing operations in france will not result in significant legal or other costs that have not been accrued for in the restructuring charges 
for example  the company has been informally notified of a tax audit to be conducted in france during the first half of the audit will cover payroll and benefits  corporate income taxes and vat value added tax 
it is too early to assess the outcome of this audit 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur claims or assessments from this audit that have not been accrued 
in connection with the discontinuance of the clik mobile drives  the company intended to build out the remaining inventory associated with the clik digital camera bundle model and sell the inventory through the first quarter of and discontinue production and marketing of all other clik mobile drive models 
in the fourth quarter of  the company had to abandon its plans to sell its clik digital camera bundle inventory because a discontinued component by a vendor made it impossible to complete final assembly 
this resulted in a million non restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of at december   the company expected that the majority of the restructuring reserves associated with the united states restructuring actions would be utilized by the end of june  with the remainder being utilized in the third quarter of acquisition 
in april  the company completed the purchase of certain assets of syquest technology  inc and its subsidiaries  syquest  including intellectual property  inventory and fixed assets in the us  europe and malaysia 
the total purchase price of the asset purchase in the us and europe was million and the purchase price of the malaysian assets was million 
intellectual property of million arising from the purchase is being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
no material obligations or liabilities of syquest were assumed by the company 
as part of the purchase  the company released syquest and syquest released the company from all claims in connection with patent and trademark infringement litigation pending between the parties in delaware and in paris  france 
interest and other income and expense 
the company recorded interest income of million in  as compared to million in  due to increased available cash  cash equivalent and temporary investment balances in interest expense was million in  as compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the company paying off on march  a series of subordinated notes with idanta partners ltd 
and another entity affiliated with david j 
dunn  chairman of the company s board of directors  under which the company borrowed million 
also included in other income and expense were bank charges  miscellaneous royalty income  gains and losses on disposal of assets and foreign currency gains and losses 
income taxes 
for  the company recorded an income tax provision of million  reflecting an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  offset by a million increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
this compares to an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss of million  reduced by a million increase in the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
the benefit of million  excluding the million increase in the valuation allowance  differs by million from the benefit of million computed by applying the federal statutory rate of to the pre tax loss of million  due to the tax effect of state income taxes  other tax deductible permanent items and lower taxes on unremitted foreign earnings considered to be permanently invested through the third quarter of in the third quarter of  the company fully reserved its net deferred tax assets primarily because of the cumulative net operating losses for and the first three quarters of a portion of this valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of as net deferred tax assets were reduced in the fourth quarter of the million increase in the valuation allowance during was recorded in accordance with sfas  which requires that a valuation allowance be established when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
at december   the company had total deferred tax assets of million related to foreign and domestic operations 
these total deferred tax assets reflect the tax benefit of temporary differences  tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the total deferred tax assets were reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million and by a valuation allowance of million 
as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which reflected the tax benefit of million in future tax deductions  for which the company had established a full valuation allowance 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets related to domestic net operating loss carryforwards  which reflected the tax benefit of million in future tax deductions  for which the company has established a full valuation allowance 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in additionally  as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities  which reflected the benefit of million in future domestic tax deductions  for which the company had established a full valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments of million compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 
the increase of million of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments in compares to an increase of million in at december   million of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in the united states  compared to million at december  at december   million of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in foreign countries primarily western europe  compared to million at december  deferred tax liabilities for estimated us federal and state taxes of million and million as of december  and  respectively  have been accrued on unremitted foreign earnings of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
us taxes have not been provided for unremitted foreign earnings of million which are considered to be permanently invested in non us operations 
the additional non us tax liability  if such amounts were remitted  would be approximately million 
working capital of million increased by million from million at december  the increase in working capital in reflected primarily cash balances which increased million and deferred income taxes which increased million 
the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to to at the end of  compared to to at the end of the decrease in trade receivables was due primarily to lower sales in fourth quarter versus fourth quarter  the timing of sales and collections during the respective periods and a decrease in the days sales outstanding dso from days in the fourth quarter in to days in the fourth quarter of the decrease in income taxes receivables was due primarily to the receipt of domestic tax refunds in the second quarter of the decrease in accounts payable was due primarily to timing of inventory receipts and related payments to vendors resulting from lower fourth quarter sales 
the decrease in other current liabilities was due to a combination of decreases in purchase commitments  deferred revenue  accrued restructuring charges and accrued warranty that were partially offset by increases in accrued payroll and bonus and accrued advertising 
during  cash provided from operating activities amounted to million compared with million in cash provided from operating activities in was derived mainly from net income and non cash charges while cash provided from operating activities in was derived mainly from changes in assets and liabilities 
cash provided from operating activities in was used in part to purchase property  plant and equipment of million  for repayment of notes payable and lease obligations of million and to purchase million of the company s common stock 
the current and long term portions of capitalized lease obligations at december  totaled approximately million 
the company had no outstanding notes payable or other long term debt at december  the company cancelled its credit facility in may  two months prior to the credit facility s scheduled expiration date of july  during the fourth quarter of  the company redeemed its million of convertible subordinated notes 
on september   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
any repurchase of shares is expected to be funded using the company s available working capital 
during  the company repurchased  shares for approximately million 
the company believes that its balance of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flow from operations and future sources of available financing  will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures and stock repurchase program during the next twelve months 
however  cash flow from operations  investing activities and the precise amount and timing of the company s future financing needs  cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the market demand for the company s products  the availability of critical components  the progress of the company s product development efforts and the continued success of the company in managing its inventory  trade receivables and accounts payable 
fiscal calendar under the company s fiscal calendar  quarters for will end on the following dates compared to the corresponding dates for q april march q july june q september september q december december management believes the calendar better aligns the company s fiscal quarters with its customer s fiscal quarters 
under the calendar for fiscal  the first quarter of will have more days than the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of will have less days than the fourth quarter of the company plans to continue its practice of releasing earnings on the third thursday following quarter end 
other matters in connection with a review of the company s periodic sec reports  the company has received comments from the staff of the sec requesting various supplemental information and certain additional disclosures 
the staff has also questioned aspects of the company s accounting for its acquisition of nomai  the subsequent evaluation of impairment of goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring charges recorded by the company in in particular  the staff has questioned whether a in connection with the nomai acquisition  approximately million of the acquisition cost should have been recorded as post acquisition expenses  rather than as goodwill  b any remaining unamortized goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition should have been written off in the third quarter of when the company decided to cease manufacturing at the nomai facilities in avranches  france the amount of unamortized goodwill reported by the company at the end of the third quarter of was million  and c the company had in place a sufficiently detailed plan to support the restructuring charges which amounted to million and million in the second quarter and second half of  respectively 
the company s management believes that the company s accounting for each of these matters  which is described in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements  is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable accounting literature 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in its position 
if the company does not prevail  the company may be required to restate its financial statements in order to adjust the manner in which it has accounted for the nomai acquisition  the subsequent evaluation of the impairment of the goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring actions 
the company does not believe that any such restatement would have a material adverse effect on the company s current financial condition or future results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for companies to report information about derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
this statement amended the effective date of sfas sfas will now be effective for financial statements issued for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas on january  as discussed in more detail in the section entitled disclosures about market risk  the company s only activity that falls under sfas is the company s hedging of its foreign currency denominated balance sheet exposure 
the company typically enters into its foreign exchange forward contracts a few days before its quarter ends  therefore  the change in value in the contracts that must be recognized in the financial statements is  under normal circumstances  immaterial 
when the company adopts sfas  the change in value in the foreign exchange forward contracts will be recognized in other income and expense in the same period as the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur  which is the company s current accounting treatment 
therefore  sfas will not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab provided guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
during  the company also adopted the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which discusses the income statement classification of amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling  as well as for costs incurred related to shipping and handling 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results the company s future operating results will depend in large part on the success of its zip  jaz  iomega cd rw and pocketzip product solutions for personal computers and other devices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in establishing its products as the preferred solutions for those market needs 
the extent to which the zip  jaz  iomega cd rw and pocketzip products achieve and maintain a significant market presence will depend upon a number of factors  including the price  performance  quality and other characteristics of the company s products and of competing solutions rumored  announced or introduced by other vendors  the emergence of any competing solutions as industry standards  the success of the company in meeting targeted availability dates for new and enhanced products  the success of the company in establishing and maintaining oem arrangements and meeting oem quality  supply and other requirements  the willingness of oems to promote computer and other products containing the company s drives  the ability of the company to create demand for zip  jaz  iomega cd rw and pocketzip products  the success of the company s efforts to make continued improvements to customer service and satisfaction  the public perception of the company and its products  including statements made by industry analysts or consumers and adverse publicity resulting from such statements or from litigation filed against the company  and the overall market demand for personal computers and other products with which the company s products can be used 
the company s business strategy is substantially dependent on maximizing sales of its proprietary zip  jaz and pocketzip disks  which generate significantly higher margins than the related drives 
if this strategy is not successful  either because the company does not establish a sufficiently large installed base of zip  jaz and pocketzip drives  because the sales mix between disks and drives is below levels anticipated by the company  because another party succeeds in producing or marketing disks that are compatible with any of the company s drive products without infringing the company s proprietary rights or for any other reason  the company s sales would be adversely affected  and its results of operations would be disproportionately adversely affected 
sales of zip products have accounted for a significant majority of the company s revenues since however  these sales may not be indicative of the long term demand for zip products  and in  zip revenues decreased approximately from accordingly  historic sales levels should not be assumed to be an indication of future sales levels 
shipments of zip drives to oem customers accounted for approximately of total zip drive shipments in  compared to in the level of future shipments of zip drives to oem customers will depend in great part on the company s ability to further reduce the cost of zip drives and on the extent to which the incorporation of cd rw or dvd recordable drives into oem products results in a reduction in the demand for oem products also incorporating a built in zip drive 
the company anticipates continued sales decline in the future for the jaz product platform as a result of replacement products entering the market and changing customer requirements 
the process of managing jaz and maximizing its profitability is different than managing a growing product platform  and involves maintaining the size of the product s infrastructure and monitoring vendor commitments and inventory levels to prevent inventory write offs and cancellation costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in managing the jaz product platform and in maximizing its profitability in the future 
the company s business strategy for iomega cd rw is different from its strategy for its other products because the drive does not use proprietary media and thus has lower overall margins 
with the low margins  and new product introductions  the company has to closely monitor its sales channels  advertising and other marketing expenses to still sell the product profitably 
the cd rw drive market is very competitive and includes several established participants 
in light of the competitive marketplace for this product  and the lower margins  the company is at risk that it will not be able to sell this product profitably 
the company s pocketzip products represent the company s first products targeted to portable consumer electronics manufacturers in addition to the personal computer markets 
the company does not have prior experience in consumer electronics channels and  accordingly  there are additional risks that the pocketzip products will not achieve significant market presence or otherwise be successful 
the company has taken charges totaling million in and million in related to the net realizable value of inventory and equipment associated with the clik platform 
although the company is making significant efforts to develop applications for the pocketzip platform  particularly in the digital audio market  and believes the products have potential in the enterprise and oem markets  there is no assurance the company will not be required to take additional charges associated with the pocketzip platform in the future 
during the third quarter of  the company introduced its own digital audio player  named hipzip 
market acceptance of pocketzip products as a storage solution for digital audio players  digital cameras and other electronic devices is dependent upon obtaining a significant market presence and continuing to increase oem relationships with manufacturers  who produce digital devices incorporating built in pocketzip drives 
the company has entered into other arrangements under which the company will purchase products from other businesses and market those products under the iomega name 
examples of this strategy include microdrive  compactflash and smartmedia all announced since the beginning of the fourth quarter of these products are subject to many of the same risks described above with respect to iomega cd rw products 
with the introduction of several new products such as hipzip  fotoshow and various software products  the company has expanded into new markets and channels such as digital audio players  digital photo storage display  and packaged software in which the company does not have any prior experience 
the company faces additional risks that these new or other future products will not achieve significant market presence or otherwise be successful 
the company s future operating results will depend in part on its success in introducing enhanced and new products in a timely and competitively effective manner 
the company has announced the new peerless drive system  the development of which is still ongoing 
in addition to the other risks described herein which relate to all of the company s products  the risks relating to peerless include the following development of the product involves the implementation of several new technologies  the company s dependency upon a third party for some of the key technology to be used in the product  and the fact that a number of the potential market applications for peerless are new 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of peerless as scheduled or that peerless will achieve significant market presence or otherwise be successful 
the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  because the company s expense levels including budgeted selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
for example  the fourth quarter is traditionally a seasonally strong quarter for the company  and during the fourth quarter of  the company increased its advertising and marketing expenditures in an effort to increase sales 
however  sales decreased unexpectedly and operating results were negatively impacted by the incremental advertising expenditures 
the company s future operating results are subject to risks associated with deteriorating general economic conditions and declining consumer confidence 
a decrease in consumer spending could have a direct impact on the company s revenues 
management of the company s inventory levels is very complex 
the company s customers frequently adjust their ordering patterns in response to various factors including perceptions of the company s ability to meet demand  the company s and competitors inventory supply in the retail and distribution channel  timing of new product introductions  seasonal fluctuations  company and customer promotions  the consolidation of customer distribution centers  pricing considerations  and the attractiveness of the company s products as compared with competing products 
customers may increase orders during times of shortages  cancel orders if the channel is filled with currently available products  or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
any excess supply could result in price reductions and inventory writedowns  which in turn could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s business includes a significant volume of oem sales 
in an oem business  a high proportion of sales are concentrated among a small number of customers 
although the company believes its relationships with oem customers are generally good  a relatively small number of customers could represent a business risk that the loss of one or more accounts could adversely affect the company s financial condition or operating results 
the company s customers are generally not obligated to purchase any minimum volume and are generally able to terminate their relationship with the company at will 
if changes in purchase volume or customer relationships resulted in decreased oem demand for the company s drives  whether by loss of or delays in orders  the company s financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected 
the company believes that in order to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition  it will be necessary to further reduce the manufacturing costs of its products  thus enabling the company to sell its products at lower prices 
the company is continuing to focus on reducing the manufacturing costs of its products by reducing the cost of parts and components used in the company s products through improved inventory management and product design modifications and by taking advantage of industry wide reductions in costs  increasing manufacturing efficiencies  and decreasing defect rates 
this is particularly true for the company s oem business  as oem customers are particularly price sensitive 
the company s ability to reduce manufacturing costs may be adversely affected if the lower sales volumes reported by the company result in less favorable pricing for components purchased from third parties 
in addition  the company faces development  manufacturing  and demand risks with regard to recently introduced products and to future products 
future operating results will also depend on the company s ability to effectively manage obsolescence risks associated with products that are phased out and its success in anticipating and ramping to volume production of new or enhanced products 
the factors described above relating to zip  jaz  iomega cd rw and pocketzip products are  or will be  relevant to any other products currently sold by the company or new products introduced by the company in the future 
the company has experienced problems  and may experience problems in the future  relating to the quality  reliability and or availability of certain of its products 
for example  the company has recalled certain products and experienced manufacturing interruptions due to quality problems 
any product availability  quality or reliability problems experienced by the company  or claims filed against the company as a result of these problems  could have an adverse effect on the company s sales and net income  result in damage to the company s reputation in the marketplace  and subject the company to damage claims from its customers 
in addition  component problems  shortages  quality issues or other factors affecting the supply of the company s products could provide an opportunity for competing products to increase their market share 
future operating results also depend on intellectual property and antitrust matters including the possibility that infringement claims asserted from time to time against the company could require the company to pay royalties to a third party in order to continue to market and distribute one or more of the company s current or future products and also includes the possibility that the company would be required to devote unplanned resources to developing modifications to its products or marketing programs 
the company has experienced difficulty in the past  and may experience difficulty in the future  in obtaining a sufficient supply of many key components on a timely and cost effective basis 
also  many components incorporated or used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently available only from single or sole source suppliers or from a limited number of suppliers and are purchased by the company without guaranteed supply arrangements 
in particular  media used in zip mb disks and pocketzip disks is obtained exclusively from fuji photo film  certain integrated circuits used in zip drives are obtained exclusively from texas instruments  media used in jaz disks is obtained exclusively from hmt technology  motors used in jaz and pocketzip drives are obtained exclusively from nidec corporation  head stack assemblies hsas used in jaz drives are obtained exclusively from read rite international  hsas used in zip notebook and pocketzip drives are obtained exclusively from sae magnetics and disk enclosures used in pocketzip disks are obtained exclusively from jeb engineering design  ltd 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 
the inability to obtain sufficient components and equipment to obtain or develop alternative sources of supply at competitive prices and quality or to avoid manufacturing delays could prevent the company from producing sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy market demand or  in the case of a component purchased exclusively from one supplier  the company could be prevented from producing any quantity of the affected product s until such component becomes available from an alternative source  delay product shipments  increase the company s material or manufacturing costs  cause an imbalance in the inventory levels of certain components and cause the company to modify the design of its products to use a more readily available component  which may result in product performance problems 
any or all of these problems could in turn result in the loss of customers  provide an opportunity for competing products to achieve market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components generally extend at most one to two quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component 
the quantities on the purchase order are based on estimated sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it can be difficult to estimate demand 
any misestimate of demand could result in either insufficient or excess capacity and or purchase commitments 
the company has experienced difficulties in hiring and retaining employees  due in part to the company s financial performance and restructuring actions in and the company s success depends in large part upon the services of a number of key employees and the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
many members of the company s senior management team have been serving in their current positions for only a short period of time  including bruce r 
albertson  who joined the company as president and chief operating officer in november and assumed the role of president and chief executive officer in january the company s success will depend in part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and on the success of the company s senior management team in learning to work effectively as a team 
during the third quarter  the company announced plans to cease manufacturing operations in avranches  france and ceased operations shortly thereafter 
there can be no assurance that the company s cessation of manufacturing operations in france will not result in significant legal or other costs that have not been accrued for in the restructuring charges 
the legal requirements in france relating to workforce reductions are very strict and the social plan approved for the workforce can take up to two years to fully administrate 
the company is currently undergoing a tax audit in france 
the audit covers payroll and benefits  corporate income taxes and vat value added tax 
it is too early to assess the outcome of this audit 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur claims or assessments from this audit that have not been accrued 
significant portions of the company s revenues are generated in europe and asia 
the company s existing infrastructure outside of the united states is less mature and developed than in the united states 
consequently  future sales and operating income from these regions are less predictable than in the united states 
the company has also experienced significant turnover in its international management  and the managing directors for both the asia pacific and european operations have been in their present positions less than six months 
in addition  operating expenses may increase as those operations mature and increase in size 
the company s international sales transactions are generally denominated in us dollars 
fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by foreign customers could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
in addition  the company is continuing to assess potential issues relating to the adoption of the euro  and is contemplating actions such as invoicing customers in their local currency instead of the us dollar 
the company intends to continue expanding its international operations into latin america during this will require the company to add additional infrastructure in latin america resulting in an increase in operating expenses that will not necessarily be offset by an increase in revenue or gross margins 
in addition  the latin america economy is not as mature as the economy in the countries that the company currently does business 
this could result in an increased exposure associated with the collectability of customer accounts 
on april   the company s shareholders approved an employee stock option exchange program exchange program  pursuant to which the company has granted approximately million new stock options at an exercise price of in exchange for approximately million previously outstanding stock options which had exercise prices above 
the new options issued under the exchange program are subject to variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation interpretation 
under variable plan accounting  the company is required to recognize compensation expense in its statement of operations for any increase in the market price of the company s common stock above the market price at july  which was the effective date of interpretation 
this compensation expense must be recorded on a quarterly basis until the option is exercised  forfeited or expires unexercised 
the impact of the new options granted under the exchange program on the company s financial statements will depend on quarterly fluctuations in the company s common stock price and the dates of exercises  forfeitures or cancellations of the new options by employees 
depending on these factors  the company could be required to record significant compensation expense during the life of the options  which expire in april moreover  because the precise amount of compensation expense will depend on the market price of the common stock at the end of each quarterly period  the company will not be able to forecast in advance the amount of compensation expense that it will incur in any future period 
factors other than those discussed above that could cause actual events or actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward looking statements include the ability of management to manage an increasingly complex business  transportation issues  product and component pricing  changes in analysts earnings estimates  competition  technological changes and advances  adoption of technology or communications standards affecting the company s products  intellectual property rights  litigation  general economic conditions  changes or slowdowns in overall market demand for personal computer products and other consumer products which utilize the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate risks 
the company cancelled its million credit facility in may and redeemed its convertible subordinated notes in october and did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  should the company need to borrow funds in the future  it would be subject to interest rate risks 
the company is also subject to interest rate risks on its current cash balances 
the company is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company has international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from the functional currency of the company 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company attempts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to company policies 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  the company is using forward contracts only to hedge balance sheet exposure 
the contracts are primarily in european currencies  the singapore dollar and the japanese yen 
the contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed three months 
the company has a substantial presence in malaysia 
in september  the ruling party in malaysia fixed the malaysian ringgit to the us dollar 
the company experienced a loss related to the fixing of the currency 
the company has recognized this loss in other expense for the year ended december  the company has material amounts of accounts payable denominated in ringgit 
currently  the foreign currency markets are closed to hedging alternatives in ringgit 
when the foreign currency markets re open for the ringgit  the company plans to re evaluate its hedging strategy for ringgit exposure 
when hedging balance sheet exposure  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period as the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the fair value of the corporation s forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates and interest rates applied to the forward contracts and underlying exposures described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the company s ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the company s analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposure and hedges
