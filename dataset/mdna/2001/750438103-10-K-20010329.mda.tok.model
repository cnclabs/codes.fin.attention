the average selling price of cpus decreased  in line with the general market decline 
the average selling price of cpus and monitors  for the industry in general as well as for radioshack  is expected to decrease slightly in despite this downward trend  management believes that the higher unit sales volumes of personal computers and peripherals  as well as anticipated increased sales of handheld computers and internet appliances  will contribute to increased sales of this category 
in addition  increases in sales in the personal computer and peripherals category should strengthen sales of higher gross margin products and services  such as accessories and extended service contracts 
sales in the services and other category  which includes residual income  as well as income from prepaid wireless airtime  repair services and extended service contracts  increased approximately in dollars  but decreased as a percent of radioshack retail sales to in from in the increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in residual income received from radioshack s third party providers of wireless communications  offset by a decrease in sales of prepaid wireless airtime

com sales from this category to the appropriate product categories in residual income is also earned on sales of sprint long distance and paging services

in  radioshack earned approximately million of residual income  compared to million in at year end  the company earned residual income on approximately million service provider subscribers 
residual income is expected to continue to increase in  however  increases are dependent upon such factors as continued usage of certain services and stability of average revenue per subscriber  among other factors
