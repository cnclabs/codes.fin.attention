seasonality and variability in quarterly results airnet s operations historically have been somewhat seasonal and somewhat dependent on the number of banking holidays falling during the week 
because financial institutions are currently airnet s principal customers  airnet s air system is scheduled primarily around the needs of financial institution customers 
when financial institutions are closed  there is no need for airnet to operate a full system 
airnet s fiscal quarter ending december is often the most impacted by bank holidays including thanksgiving and christmas recognized by its primary customers 
when these holidays fall on monday through thursday  airnet s revenue and net income are adversely affected 
airnet s annual results fluctuate as well 
operating results are also affected by the weather 
airnet generally experiences higher maintenance costs during its fiscal quarter ending march winter weather often requires additional costs for de icing  hangar rental and other aircraft services

inflation historically  inflation has not been a significant factor to airnet 
although the value of airnet s service to its primary customers is enhanced by higher interest rates  the volume of business has not changed historically with fluctuating interest rates 
airnet has attempted to minimize the effects of inflation on its operating results through rate increases and cost controls 
fuel surcharge rebate program airnet maintains a fuel surcharge rebate program for its check delivery customers 
under this program  as the opis cmh ohio price information service columbus  ohio station price of jet fuel exceeds per gallon  customers are surcharged 
in turn  if the opis cmh price falls below per gallon  the same customers receive a rebate 
due to the recent increases in fuel prices  airnet also implemented temporary fuel surcharges to its express delivery customers 
the initial surcharge rate was set at on most air and ground charges on february  in september  the rate was increased to 
airnet intends to rescind the surcharge when fuel prices return to lower  more stabilized levels 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this form k  including  but not limited to  information regarding future economic performance and plans and objectives of airnet s management  are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  may  plan  project and similar expressions are intended to be among statements that identify forward looking statements 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties such as the following  in addition to other factors not listed  which could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statement potential changes by the faa  which could increase the regulation of airnet s business  potential changes by the federal reserve  which could change the competitive environment of transporting cancelled checks  adverse weather conditions  the ability to attract and retain qualified pilots  technological advances and increases in the use of electronic funds transfers  as well as other economic  competitive and governmental factors affecting airnet s markets  prices and other facets of its operations 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
airnet undertakes no responsibility to update for changes related to these or any other factors that may hereafter occur 
the following factors  in addition to those factors listed above and other possible factors not listed  could affect airnet s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements competition the market for express air and ground delivery service is highly competitive 
airnet s bank services division competes primarily against the federal reserve bank s check relay network  which has significantly greater financial and other resources than airnet 
the federal reserve is regulated by the monetary control act of  which in general requires that the federal reserve price its services on a cost basis plus a set percentage private sector market adjustment factor 
failure by the federal reserve to comply with the monetary control act could have an adverse competitive impact on airnet 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the monetary control act will not be amended  modified or repealed  or that new legislation affecting airnet s business will not be enacted 
although major participants in the next day and second day air delivery market such as ups and fedex have also entered the business of sameday and early morning delivery  they have not had a material adverse effect on airnet s business to date 
however  there can be no assurance that these competitors will not have a material adverse effect in the future 
technology some analysts have predicted that the increased use of electronic funds transfers will lead to a checkless society  which could adversely affect the demand for airnet s check delivery services to the financial services industry 
in addition  some financial services industry analysts have predicted the development of various forms of imaging technology that could reduce or eliminate the need for prompt delivery of cancelled checks 
similarly  technological advances in the nature of electronic mail and telefax have affected the demand for on call delivery services by express delivery customers 
while none of these technological advances have had a significant adverse impact on airnet s business to date  there can be no assurances that these or similar technologies  or other regulatory or technological changes in the check clearance and national payment systems  will not have an adverse affect on airnet s business in the future 
permits and licensing  regulation airnet s delivery operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
failure by airnet to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with the applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of the company s authority to conduct certain of its operations 
airnet s flight operations are regulated by the faa under part of the federal aviation regulations 
among other things  these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews 
the faa is currently contemplating certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines  which  if adopted  could increase airnet s operating costs 
these changes  if adopted  could also require airnet and other operators regulated by the faa to hire additional flight crew personnel 
in addition  congress  from time to time  has considered various means  including excise taxes  to raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and personnel 
there can be no assurances that congress will not change the current federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes  which could adversely affect airnet s business 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk airnet is exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
airnet s primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at december   airnet had a million outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility 
this facility bears interest at airnet s option of a fixed rate determined by the eurodollar rate  a negotiated rate or a floating rate 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one hundred basis point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately  per year 
in  airnet entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a bank as a hedge against the interest rate risk associated with borrowings 
the swap agreements each have a notional amount of million and effectively locked in a portion of airnet s variable rate revolving credit liability at fixed rates of and plus a margin based on airnet s funded debt ratio 
each swap agreement contains a three year term 
at december   the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps was approximately
