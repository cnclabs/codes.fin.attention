item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in pages f through f in this form k 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
overview the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business since its inception on may  the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
for the period from our inception through december   we have purchased or entered into local marketing  management and consulting agreements with radio stations throughout the us and caribbean 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of these acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
we currently own and operate stations in us markets and provide sales and marketing services under local marketing  management and consulting agreements pending fcc approval of acquisition to stations in us markets 
we currently own five stations and have obtained a license to commence operations on one station in the caribbean market 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the us based on number of stations 
we believe we are the tenth largest radio broadcasting company in the us based on pro forma net revenues 
we will own and operate a total of radio stations fm and am in us markets upon fcc approval of all pending acquisitions and divestitures 
advertising revenue and broadcast cash flow our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally once  twice or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting rating is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income during the years ended december   and we will seek to continue to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage interep national radio sales  inc  a national representative company 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local station management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate broadcast cash flow 
results of operations management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december   and have been presented on an historical basis 
additionally  for net revenue  operating expenses  and operating income before depreciation and amortization we have included management s discussion and analysis of results of operations on a pro forma basis 
the pro forma results for compared to assume all of the acquisitions described in item i  part i of this report had occurred on january  year ended december  versus the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of radio stations during the year ended december  approximately million of increase  operating certain radio stations acquired in for a full twelve months approximately million of increase  and improved spot utilization 
in addition  on a same station basis  net revenue for the stations in markets operated for at least a full year increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to net revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase in same station net revenue is the result of additional local revenue generated from improved spot utilization from the sale of radio spots 
station operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of radio stations during the year ended december  approximately million of increase  operating certain radio stations acquired in for a full twelve months approximately million of increase  as well as the recognition of unusual bad debt expense of approximately million 
the unusually high bad debt expense recorded for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the following factors the completion of the first and second phases of the asset exchange and sales transactions with clear channel communications  and the coincidental loss of local employee incentive to enforce the collection of receivables in divested markets  the detrimental effects of certain pre existing credit and collection policies and sales employee compensation policies  significant turnover of management and sales force  including representatives who maintained relationships with trade debtors and had responsibility for ensuring collection of outstanding invoices  and overall declines in the us economy 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented a new credit and collection policy across all markets designed to ensure uniform procedures for the extension of credit and the collection of receivables 
the management team has also created incentives for the company s sales personnel in each of our markets to collect delinquent accounts receivable 
we believe that these policies and procedures will reduce the company s loss experience from uncollectible accounts receivable 
in addition  on a same station basis  for the stations in markets operated for at least a full year  station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in same station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees are primarily attributable to the increased variable selling costs associated with additional same station net revenue discussed above approximately million of increase 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization relating to radio station acquisitions consummated during and a full year of depreciation and amortization on radio station acquisitions consummated during lma fees 
lma fees increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to local marketing  management and consulting fees paid to sellers in connection with the commencement of operations  management of or consulting services provided to radio stations during corporate  general and administrative expenses 
corporate  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in corporate general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to corporate resources added during to effectively manage the company s new structure and growing radio station portfolio  plus one time  non recurring expenses relative to the termination of employees and employee moving expense approximately million of increase  an aircraft lease which was also terminated approximately million of increase and increased audit  legal  and insurance fees approximately million of increase 
other income expense  net 
other income  net  increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a gain on sale of million  realized upon the transfer of stations in markets along with certain tangible property associated with stations in markets to clear channel communications in the third and fourth quarter of  offset by the write off of million of costs associated with failed acquisitions and the write off of commitment fees associated with unutilized financing arrangements 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared with an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to deferred tax expense on the company s third and fourth quarter gain on sales of stations incurred as a result of the completion of the asset sales with clear channel communications 
preferred stock dividends  deemed dividends  accretion of discount and premium on redemption of preferred stock 
preferred stock dividends  accretion of discount and premium on redemption of preferred stock decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the redemption of  shares of the company s series a preferred stock on october  the fair value of common stock purchase warrants was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a deemed dividend on the series b preferred stock  increasing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by million 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
as a result of the factors describe above  net loss attributable to common stockholders decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  broadcast cash flow 
as a result of the factors described above  broadcast cash flow decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  ebitda 
as a result of the factors described above  ebitda decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  intangible assets 
intangible assets  net of amortization  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill  although the company possesses certain other intangible assets obtained in connection with our acquisitions  such as non compete agreements 
the increase in intangible assets  net during is attributable to acquisitions during the year  including the connoisseur acquisition  less the net dispositions in the asset exchange and sales transactions with clear channel 
specifically identified intangible assets  including broadcasting licenses  are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of the related acquisition 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets and specifically identified intangible assets 
although intangible assets are recorded in the company s financial statements at amortized cost  we believe that such assets  especially broadcast licenses  can significantly appreciate in value by successfully executing our operating strategy  which is described herein 
the company recognized accounting gains of million during from a series of asset exchange and sales transactions with clear channel 
we believe these gains indicate that certain internally generated intangible assets  which are not recorded for accounting purposes  can significantly increase the value of our portfolio of stations over time 
the company s strategic initiative to focus on its core radio business is designed to enhance the overall value of our stations and maximize the value of the related broadcast licenses

pro forma station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the majority of the increase in pro forma net revenues from to is due to an improvement in the utilization of advertising spot inventory at the station level during the calendar year 
the majority of the increase in pro forma station operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees is due to the increase in programming  promotion and selling expenses associated with the increase in personnel in the markets we operated during the year  along with the expenses associated with the additional spot  promotion and event revenue  and with the company s operation of the radio stations subsequent to the respective acquisition dates 
seasonality the company expects that its operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the fourth quarter of the year 
the seasonality of the company s business reflects the adult orientation of the company s formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in the company s quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of the company s cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations and to a lesser extent  working capital needs  capital expenditures and interest and debt service payments 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from the offering of our debt and equity securities and borrowings under credit agreements 
our principal need for funds in the future are expected to include the need to fund future acquisitions  interest and debt service payments  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
we believe the company s present cash positions will be sufficient to meet our capital needs through late second quarter or early third quarter beyond that time  the company will need to raise approximately million  through additional draws available under the its current revolving credit facility or through the issuance of stock or other securities to fund its pending acquisitions 
we believe that availability under our credit facility  cash generated from operations or future asset sales and proceeds from future debt or equity financing will be sufficient to meet our capital needs 
the ability of the company to complete its pending acquisitions is  however  dependent upon on the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operations increased million  to million  from net cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the maturing of our markets and increased focus managing our current properties 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the acquisition of the connoisseur markets on october  for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  the decrease in cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december  was the result of funding our acquisitions with asset sales rather than debt and equity 
historical acquisitions 
during the year ended december   the company completed acquisitions across markets for an aggregate purchase price of million 
pending acquisitions 
as of december   the company was a party to various agreements to acquire stations across markets for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
between january  and january   the company closed on the acquisition of properties in markets representing million in purchase price 
these acquisitions were funded through the proceeds of asset exchanges approximately million and asset sales approximately million  also completed between january  and march  we intend to fund the pending acquisitions  which are expected to approximate million  with cash on hand  the proceeds of our credit facility or future credit facilities  and other to be identified sources 
as of march   the company believes it will need additional funding  above cash on hand  of approximately million to complete the pending acquisitions 
the ability of the company to complete the pending acquisitions is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing 
as of december   million of escrow deposits were outstanding related to pending transactions 
subsequent to december   million of those deposits were applied toward transactions that were completed 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain financing necessary to consummate the remaining pending acquisitions  the company could be liable for approximately million in purchase price 
we expect to consummate most of our pending acquisitions during the second  third and fourth quarters of  although there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated within that time frame 
in three of the markets in which there are pending acquisitions petitions to deny have been filed against the company s fcc assignment applications 
all such petitions and fcc staff inquiries must be resolved before fcc approval can be obtained and the acquisitions consummated 
there can be no assurance that the pending acquisitions will be consummated 
in addition  from time to time the company completes acquisitions following the initial grant of an assignment application by the fcc staff but before such grant becomes a final order  and a petition to review such a grant may be filed 
there can be no assurance that such grants may not ultimately be reversed by the fcc or an appellate court as a result of such petitions  which could result in the company being required to divest the assets it has acquired 
the ability of the company to make future acquisitions in addition to the pending acquisitions is dependent upon on the company s ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such financing
