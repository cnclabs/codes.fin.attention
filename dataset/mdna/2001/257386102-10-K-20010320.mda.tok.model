during the company expects to solidify its position as one of the leading homebuilders in louisville  kentucky and to take advantage of its mortgage services company s first full year of operations

seasonality and variability in quarterly results the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant seasonality and quarter to quarter variability in homebuilding activity 
typically  closings and related revenues will increase in the second half of the year 
the company believes this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter 
weather conditions can also accelerate or delay the scheduling of closings

real estate inventories the company s practice is to develop most of the lots upon which it builds its homes 
generally  the company attempts to maintain a land inventory that will be sufficient to meet its anticipated lot needs for the next three to five years 
at december   the company either owned or was under contract to purchase lots or land that could be developed into approximately  lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
the company controlled through option agreements  additional lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
during  the company exercised options to purchase  lots  including lots in louisville  kentucky 
option agreements expire at varying dates through the company s decision to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land is based upon an assessment of a number of factors  including its existing land inventory at the time and its evaluation of the future demand for its homes

of the million increase in land and land development costs  million is due to new land inventories in louisville  kentucky 
the balance of the increase in land and land development inventories is principally due to the increased cost of land and the company s need to support a larger number of sales communities

in recent years the company has experienced a greater percentage of these contracts being delayed for extensive periods of time or not being able to be completed  primarily due to opposition to acceptable zoning and other financial issues 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
the company had a total of million in good faith deposits invested in purchase commitments and cancelable purchase obligations at december  inflation and other cost increases the company is not always able to reflect all of its cost increases in the prices of its homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require it to maintain or discount those prices 
while the company attempts to maintain costs with subcontractors from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  unanticipated costs may be incurred which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require the company  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  additional costs may be incurred to obtain more subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which additional costs can result in lower gross profits
