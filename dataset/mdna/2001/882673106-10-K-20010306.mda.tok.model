loans the company manages its credit risk by establishing and implementing strategies and guidelines appropriate to the characteristics of borrowers  industries  geographic locations and risk products 
diversification of risk within each of these areas is a primary objective 
policies and procedures are developed to ensure that loan commitments conform to current strategies and guidelines 
management continually refines the company s credit policies and procedures to address the risks in the current and prospective environment and to reflect management s current strategic focus 
the credit process is controlled with continuous credit review and analysis  and review by internal and external auditors and regulatory authorities 
the company s loans are widely diversified by borrower and industry group 
the company has collateral management policies in place so that collateral lending of all types is approached on a basis consistent with safe and sound standards 
valuation analysis is utilized to take into consideration the potentially adverse economic conditions under which liquidation could occur 
collateral accepted against the commercial loan portfolio includes accounts receivable and inventory  marketable securities  equipment and agricultural products 
autos  deeds of trust  life insurance and marketable securities are accepted as collateral for the installment loan portfolio 
management of the company believes that the company has benefited from increased loan demand due to passage of the north american free trade agreement nafta and the strong population growth in the rio grande valley 
more recently  the continued devaluation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar has reduced retail sales to residents of mexico 
however  the effects of nafta and the devaluation have also increased cross border trade and industrial development including activity at twin manufacturing plants located on each side of the border referred to as maquiladoras which benefit the rio grande valley economy 
management believes the on going mexican financial problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s growth and earnings prospects  in part because the company presently has a low percentage of loans secured by mexican assets or that otherwise rely on collateral located in mexico 
the extension of credits denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which a borrower is located are called cross border credits 
the company has some dollar denominated cross border credits to individuals or companies that are residents of  or domiciled in mexico

approvals for the extension or renewal of loans without reduction of principal for more than one twelve month period are generally avoided  unless the loans are fully secured and properly margined by cash or marketable securities  or are revolving lines subject to annual analysis and renewal 
nonperforming assets the company has several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio 
the bank has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
page nonperforming assets consist of loans that the company does not expect to collect the full principal and interest based on the terms of the original loan agreement 
these include loans on nonaccrual status or that have been restructured  and other assets  primarily real estate  acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when payment of principal or interest is contractually past due days  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but uncollected is reversed and charged against current income unless the collateral provides more than adequate margin to ensure collection of that interest 
a restructured loan is generally a loan that is accruing interest  but on which concessions in terms have been made as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
the company s classification of nonperforming loans includes those loans for which management believes collection is doubtful 
management is not aware of any specific borrower relationships that are not reported as nonperforming where management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms which would cause nonperforming assets to increase materially 
nonperforming assets of million at december  increased million  compared to december  levels of million  which decreased million or compared with december  levels of million 
nonperforming loans of million at december  increased million or compared to million at december  the increase in nonperforming loans during resulted primarily from the addition of million in restructured loans during second quarter  when the company reduced interest rates on certain commercial loans to the national prime rate

cross border nonaccrual loans at december  of million decreased by  or compared to million at december  the decrease in foreclosed assets during was primarily attributable to the sale of the larger foreclosed assets and two large writedowns taken in totaling  see noninterest expense below 
loans which are contractually past due days or more  which are both well secured or guaranteed by financially responsible third parties and in the process of collection  generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
the amount of such loans past due days or more at december   and that are not classified as nonaccrual totaled million  million and million  respectively

management continues to emphasize maintaining a low level of nonperforming assets and returning nonperforming assets to an earning status 
allowance for loan losses management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain an adequate allowance 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risks of loans in the portfolio and considers factors such as specific known risks  past experience  the status and amount of nonperforming assets and economic conditions 
a specific percentage is allocated to total loans in good standing and not specifically reserved while additional amounts are added for individual loans considered to have specific loss potential 
loans identified as losses are charged off 
in addition  the loan review committee of the bank reviews the assessments of management in determining the adequacy of the bank s allowance for loan losses 
based on total allocations  the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at a level deemed appropriate by management 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  there can be no assurance that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary

liquidity management assures that adequate funds are available to meet deposit withdrawals  loan demand and maturing liabilities 
insufficient liquidity can result in higher costs of obtaining funds  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative investments 
the ability to renew and acquire additional deposit liabilities is a major source of liquidity 
the company s principal sources of funds are primarily within the local markets of the bank and consist of deposits  interest and principal payments on loans and securities  sales of loans and securities and borrowings 
cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future provide asset liquidity

the company is dependent on dividend and interest income from the bank and the sale of stock for its liquidity 
applicable federal reserve board regulations provide that bank holding companies are permitted by regulatory authorities to pay cash dividends on their common or preferred stock if consolidated earnings and consolidated capital are within regulatory guidelines 
effects of inflation financial institutions are impacted differently by inflation than are industrial companies 
while industrial and manufacturing companies generally have significant investments in inventories and fixed assets  financial institutions ordinarily do not have such investments 
as a result  financial institutions are generally in a better position than industrial companies to respond to inflationary trends by monitoring the spread between interest costs and interest income yields through adjustments of maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities 
in addition  inflation tends to increase demand for loans from financial institutions as industrial companies attempt to maintain a constant level of goods in inventory and assets 
as consumers of goods and services  financial institutions are affected by inflation as prices increase  causing an increase in costs of salaries  employee benefits  occupancy expense and similar items

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as interest rates change 
for example  if fixed rate loans are funded with floating rate deposits  the spread between loan and deposit rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the company s interest rate risk arises from transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  the company does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
interest rate risk is managed within the funds management policy of the company 
the principal objectives of the funds management policy is to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to maintain consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the board of directors oversees implementation of strategies to control interest rate risk 
the company may take steps to alter its net sensitivity position by offering deposit and or loan structures that tend to counter the natural rate risk profile of the company 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
because of the volatility of market rates and uncertainties  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of management programs to achieve a targeted moderation of risk 
in order to measure earnings and fair value sensitivity to changing rates  the company utilizes three different measurement tools including static gap analysis  simulation earnings  and market value sensitivity fair value at risk 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in net interest income from the stable rate scenario under scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates over a twelve month time horizon 
the prime rate serves as a driver and is made to rise or fall evenly in basis point increments over the month forecast interval 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income over a month period as of december  and december  page increase decrease in net interest income changes in interest estimated net rates basis points interest income amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  all the measurements of risk described above are made based upon the company s business mix and interest rate exposures at the particular point in time 
an immediate basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario  used to calibrate risk  and does not necessarily represent management s current view of future market developments 
because of uncertainties as to the extent of customer behavior  refinance activity  absolute and relative loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor pricing and market behavior  product volumes and mix  and other unexpected changes in economic events impacting movements and volatility in market rates  there can be no assurance that simulation results are reliable indicators of net interest income under such conditions 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the dollar amount of difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities within a given time period gap 
a gap ratio is determined by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a ratio of indicates a perfectly matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements would be zero 
the following table summarizes interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities by their repricing dates at december  over interest rate sensitivity analysis months months months years years total dollars in thousands loans       securities available for sale      held to maturity   time deposits  federal funds sold   total interest bearing assets       savings   money market checking and savings accounts   time deposits      other borrowed money   total interest bearing liabilities      rate sensitivity gap       cumulative rate sensitivity gap      ratio of cumulative rate sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative rate sensitive interest earning assets to cumulative rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive interest earning assets less rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities
