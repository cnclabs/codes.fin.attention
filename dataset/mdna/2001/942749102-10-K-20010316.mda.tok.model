the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the euro effects the company as the company has manufacturing and distribution facilities in several of the member countries and trades extensively across europe 
the long term competitive implications of the conversion are currently being assessed by the company  however  the company has experienced a reduction in the risks associated with foreign exchange 
at this time  the company is not anticipating that any significant costs will be incurred due to the introduction and conversion to the euro 
the company is in the process of implementing systems to receive and make payments in euros 
the company anticipates these systems will be in place by january  responsibility for financial statements the company is responsible for the objectivity and integrity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the financial statements of necessity include the company s estimates and judgments relating to matters not concluded by year end 
financial information contained elsewhere in the annual report and form k is consistent with that included in the financial statements 
the company maintains a system of internal accounting controls 
although there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of accounting controls  the company believes that its system provides reasonable  but not absolute  assurance that its assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and that its accounting records are sufficiently reliable to permit the preparation of financial statements that conform in all material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

other this report on form k may include statements which are not historical facts and are considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements reflect watts industries current views about future events and financial performance 
investors should not rely on forward looking statements  because they are subject to a variety of risks  uncertainty  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from watts industries expectations and watts industries expressly does not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements 
these factors include but are not limited to the following loss of market share through competition  introduction of competing products by other companies  pressure on prices from competitors  suppliers  and or customers regulatory obstacles  lack of acceptance of new products  changes in plumbing and heating markets  changes in global demand for the company s products  changes for distribution of the company s products  interest rates  foreign exchange fluctuations  cyclicality of industries in which the company markets certain of its products  and general economic factors in markets where the company s products are sold  manufactured  or marketed  changes in the status of current litigations  including the james jones case  and other factors discussed in the company s report filed with the securities and exchange commission 
certain factors affecting future results this report includes forward looking statements which reflect watts industries current views about future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like plan  believe  expect  will  anticipate  estimate and other words of similar meaning 
investors should not rely on forward looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks  uncertainties  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements are as follows down economic cycles  particularly reduced levels of housing starts and remodeling  have an adverse affect on our business and revenues 
the businesses of most of our customers  particularly plumbing and heating wholesalers and home improvement retailers  is cyclical 
therefore  the level of the company s business activity has been cyclical  fluctuating with economic cycles  in particular  with housing starts and remodeling levels 
housing starts and remodeling are  in turn  heavily influenced by mortgage interest rates  consumer debt levels  changes in disposable income  employment growth  consumer confidence and  on a short term basis  weather conditions 
there can be no assurance that a downturn in these factors affecting housing starts and remodeling will not occur and if housing and remodeling starts are materially reduced  it is likely such reduction would have a material adverse effect on the company due to reduced revenue 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business since we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales outside north america  as a percentage of our total sales  was in accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including o changes in foreign currency exchange rates  o changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  o trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  o potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  o differing labor regulations  o differing protection of intellectual property  and o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
reductions in the supply of raw materials and increases in the prices of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results we require substantial amounts of raw materials bronze  brass  cast iron and substantially all raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources 
the availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  new laws or regulations  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers  changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels 
any change in the supply of  or price for  these raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect our reported results exchange rates between the united states dollar  in which our results are and will be reported  and the local currency in the countries in which we provide many of our services  may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
since we report our interim and annual results in united states dollars  we are subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
when the dollar appreciates against the applicable local currency in any reporting period  the actual earnings generated by our services in that country are diminished in the conversion 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies as a significant portion of our revenue  and certain of our costs  assets and liabilities  are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
approximately of our revenue during was from sales outside of north america 
for the twelve months ended december  the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar had an adverse impact on revenue of  and on earnings per share of 
our share of revenue in non dollar denominated currencies may continue to increase in future periods 
we can offer no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we face intense competition we encounter intense competition in all areas of our business 
additionally  customers for our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventory 
to remain competitive  we will need to invest continuously in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will maintain our competitive position 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
such laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations and require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws  and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we cannot continue operating our manufacturing facilities at current or higher levels  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we operate a number of manufacturing facilities for the production of our products 
the equipment and management systems necessary for such operations may break down  perform poorly or fail resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies 
such fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve or maintain market acceptance  our revenues may decrease 
our industry is characterized by o intense competition  o changes in end user requirements  o technically complex products  and o evolving product offerings and introductions 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer  on a timely basis  products that meet customer demands 
failure to develop new and innovative products or to custom design existing products could result in the loss of existing customers to competitors or the inability to attract new business  either of which may adversely affect our revenues 
implementation of our acquisition strategy may not be successful which could affect our ability to increase our revenues or reduce our profitability 
one of our strategies is to increase our revenues and expand our markets through acquisitions that will provide us with complementary water related products 
we expect to spend significant time and effort in expanding our existing businesses and identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and may result in higher acquisition prices 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional companies or successfully integrate such additional companies without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
also  there can be no assurance that companies acquired in the future will achieve revenues  profitability or cash flows that justify our investment in them 
in addition  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including o adverse short term effects on our reported operating results  o diversion of management s attention  o loss of key personnel at acquired companies  or o unanticipated management or operational problems or legal liabilities 
some or all of the above special risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver high quality products  we may lose customers 
product quality and performance are a priority for our customers 
our products are used in control of temperature and pressure of water as well as water quality and safety 
these applications require products that meet stringent performance and safety standards 
if we fail to maintain and enforce quality control and testing procedures  our products will not meet these stringent performance and safety standards 
substandard products would seriously harm our reputation resulting in both a loss of current customers to our competitors and damage to our ability to attract new customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face risks from product liability and other lawsuits which may adversely affect our business 
we  like other manufacturers and distributors of products designed to control and regulate water  face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury  property damage or business interruption to our customers 
we may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that our products include inadequate or improper instructions for use or installation  or inadequate warnings concerning the effects of the failure of our products 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  including the testing of raw materials and safety testing of selected finished products  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defect 
in addition  in certain cases  we rely on third party manufacturers for our products or components of our products 
although we have liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost  or  if available  will be adequate to cover any such liabilities 
one particular products liability case in which the company is a defendant is los angeles department of water and power  ex rel 
nora armenta v 
james jones company  et al 
the company recorded a charge of million after tax in the quarter ended december   which is management s estimate of the after tax cost to bring this case to resolution 
while this charge represents the after tax impact of the company s current estimate based on all available information  litigation is inherently uncertain and the actual liability to the company to fully resolve the litigation could be materially higher than this estimate 
see item  part i product liability  environmental and other litigation matters 
one of our shareholders can exercise substantial influence over our company as of february   timothy p 
horne  our chairman and chief executive beneficially owned of our outstanding shares of common stock  which of the total outstanding voting power 
as a result  mr 
horne effectively controls all matters affecting us 
as long as mr 
horne controls shares representing at least a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding stock  mr 
horne will be able to unilaterally determine the outcome of all stockholder votes and other stockholders will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
if mr 
horne were to sell a significant amount of common stock into the public market  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
see part iii  item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
the foregoing list sets forth many  but not all  of the factors that could impact upon our ability to achieve results described in any forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements that speak only as of the date made 
investors also should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that this list should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties 
investors should also realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results could vary materially from our projections 
we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of future events or developments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and prices of certain raw materials used in the manufacturing process 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging underlying economic exposure 
the derivatives the company uses are instruments with liquid markets 
the company manages most of its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis 
the company identifies all of its known exposures 
as part of that process  all natural hedges are identified 
the company then nets these natural hedges from its gross exposures 
the company s consolidated earnings  which are reported in united states dollar are subject to translation risks due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  its overall exposure to such fluctuations is reduced by the diversity of its foreign operating locations which encompass a number of different european locations  canada  and china 
the company s foreign subsidiaries transact most business  including certain intercompany transactions  in foreign currencies 
such transactions are principally purchases or sales of materials and are denominated in european currencies or the us or canadian dollar 
the company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage the risk related to intercompany purchases that occur during the course of a fiscal year and certain open foreign currency denominated commitments to sell products to third parties 
at december   the company had no forward contracts to buy foreign currencies and no unrealized gains or losses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has historically had a very low exposure to changes in interest rates 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt instruments 
information about the company s long term debt including principal amounts and related interest rates appears in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
the company purchases significant amounts of bronze ingot  brass rod and cast iron which are utilized in manufacturing its many product lines 
the company s operating results can be adversely affected by changes in commodity prices if it is unable to pass on related price increases to its customers 
the company manages this risk by monitoring related market prices  working with its suppliers to achieve the maximum level of stability in their costs and related pricing  seeking alternative supply sources when necessary and passing increases in commodity costs to its customers  to the maximum extent possible  when they occur 
additionally  on a limited basis  the company uses commodity futures contracts to manage this risk 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
