strategic business alliances and related transactions on march   ventiv entered into a strategic alliance with rxcentric  inc  a privately held new york based company which provides physicians with rapid access to comprehensive drug and pharmaceutical related information via the internet 
pursuant to a multi year agreement  the companies will share in revenues generated from this alliance  subject to significant revenue and physician recruitment milestones 
in connection with this strategic alliance  ventiv has invested million in rxcentric in exchange for a minority equity position in the firm 
following this transaction  the company announced the formation of a new operating unit  e ventiv  which will focus on the development of internet based solutions that complement ventiv s existing sales  communications and strategic consulting businesses  enhancing the company s ability to provide superior outsourced marketing and sales solutions 
specifically  e ventiv focuses on the design and development of solutions oriented toward physician interaction a primary objective of our alliance with rxcentric  patient interaction a primary objective of our alliance with helioshealth 
com which is discussed below and value added information for pharmaceutical clients 
on october   ventiv entered into a strategic alliance with helioshealth 
com  a unique direct to consumer dtc internet platform that is the leading provider of interactive kiosks or e 
stations in physician waiting rooms 
helios has installed over  e 
stations  which generate more than  unique visits per month 
in addition  the website generates an additional  unique visits per month 
helios has sold over sponsorships to major pharma companies including glaxosmithkline  johnson johnson  pfizer and pharmacia 
the companies will jointly market targeted advertising and content to clients and will share revenue generated pursuant to a multi year agreement 
in addition  ventiv s health products research business will continue to integrate dtc into its traditional consulting services and market research efforts 
in connection with this agreement  ventiv has also made a minority equity investment in helios of million 
the business activities relating to the alliances with rxcentric and helios did not materially affect results of operations for the year ending december business considerations dependence on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries our revenues are highly dependent on promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  including the pharmaceutical  medical device  diagnostics and biotechnology industries 
promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been  and could in the future be  negatively impacted by  among other things  governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental  medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products 
furthermore  the trend in the life sciences industries toward consolidation  by merger or otherwise  may result in a reduction in the use of contract sales providers 
dependence on trend toward outsourcing in the life sciences industries our business and growth depend in large part on the progression of the trend in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries toward the outsourcing of marketing and sales services 
we can give no assurance that this trend in outsourcing will continue  as companies may elect to perform such services internally 
a significant change in the direction of this trend generally  or a trend in the pharmaceutical or life sciences industries  not to use  or to reduce the use of  outsourced marketing and sales services such as those that we provide  would have a material adverse effect on our business 
risk based contracts particularly in the us  ventiv has seen an increase in demand from clients for incentive based and revenue sharing arrangements 
under incentive based arrangements  ventiv is typically paid a fixed fee and  in addition  has an opportunity to increase its earnings based on the market performance of the products being detailed in relation to targeted sales volumes  salesforce performance metrics or a combination thereof 
under revenue sharing arrangements  the ventiv s compensation is based on the market performance of the products being detailed  usually expressed as a percentage of product sales 
ventiv expects this trend to continue and  as a result  revenues derived from these arrangements are expected to increase in the near term in both absolute and relative terms 
these types of arrangements inherently transfer some market risk from clients to the company 
in addition  these arrangements can result in variability in revenue and earnings due to seasonality of product usage  changes in market share  new product introductions  overall promotional efforts and other market related factors 
risk associated with our international operations and expansion in the united kingdom and continental europe ventiv has a number of operations in the united kingdom and continental europe 
the following are the material risks inherent in conducting our international operations 
difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  
effects of governmental regulation on the demand for pharmaceutical products  particularly new products  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
foreign currency risk  and 
the risk of economic downturn in non us locations where ventiv does business 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and consequently on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our worldwide revenues in were generated from operations outside of the united states  of which were denominated in british pounds  in german marks and in french francs 
the us dollar value of our foreign generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
significant increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound  french franc  or german mark  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we continually evaluate our exposure to exchange rate risk but do not currently hedge this risk 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of our growth ventiv has grown rapidly over the past several years 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure to perform services for new clients  as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services 
our continued growth will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the high quality of the services we provide to our customers and to increase our penetration with existing customers  to recruit  motivate and retain qualified personnel  and to economically train existing sales representatives and recruit new sales representatives 
our continued growth will also require us to implement enhanced operational and financial systems and additional management resources 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or that we will be able to maintain our growth 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on technology  risk of business interruption we have invested significantly in sophisticated and specialized computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet many of our clients needs 
we have also invested significantly in sophisticated end user databases and software that enable us to market our clients products to targeted markets 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology and end user databases on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness 
in addition  our business is dependent on our computer equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of these equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur in any such event 
government regulation of handling and distribution of pharmaceutical samples in connection with the handling and distribution of samples of pharmaceutical products  we are subject to regulation by the prescription drug marketing act of and other applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states and certain regulations in the united kingdom  france  germany and the european union 
these laws regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating storage  handling and record keeping requirements for drug samples and by banning the purchase or sale of drug samples 
in certain jurisdictions  including the united kingdom and france  pharmaceutical sales representatives are subject to examination and licensing requirements under local law and industry guidelines 
our physician education services are subject to a variety of foreign  federal and state regulations relating to both the education of medical professionals and the marketing and sales of pharmaceuticals 
in addition  certain ethical guidelines promulgated by the american medical association govern the receipt by physicians of gifts in connection with the marketing of healthcare products 
these guidelines govern the honoraria and other items of value which ama physicians may receive  directly or indirectly  from pharmaceutical companies 
ventiv follows similar guidelines in effect in other countries where it provides services 
any changes in these regulations and guidelines or their application could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  loss of licenses and other penalties and could have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
government regulation of pharmaceutical and life sciences industries pharmaceutical manufacturers and the healthcare industry  in general  are subject to significant us federal and state  us  french  hungarian  austrian  german and european union regulation 
in particular  regulations affecting the pricing or marketing of pharmaceuticals could make it uneconomical or infeasible for pharmaceutical companies to market their products through medical marketing detailers 
other changes in the domestic and international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry could also have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
results of operations revenues and associated costs under pharmaceutical detailing contracts are generally based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
for consulting and educational services  ventiv s revenues are generally based on a fixed project amount 
costs of services consist of all costs specifically associated with client programs such as salary  commissions and benefits paid to personnel  including senior management associated with specific service offerings  payments to third party vendors and systems and other support facilities specifically associated with client programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with administrative functions such as finance  accounting  human resources and information technology  as well as personnel costs of senior management not specifically associated with delivery of client services 
in addition  costs related to business development and new product development are classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring and other charges include compensation to stockholders  recapitalization costs and acquisition and related costs 
restructuring charges include costs to rationalize management and employee positions  penalties for early termination of leases for office space and abandonment of related improvements to that space  as well as anticipated losses on the disposition of assets not related to ventiv s core business 
in  recapitalization costs consisted of restricted stock granted to certain key employees of the company  which vested immediately following the distribution 
acquisition and related costs consist primarily of investment banking fees  other professional service fees  certain tax payments and other contractual payments resulting from the consummation of the pooling of interests transactions  as well as the costs of consolidating certain of our acquired operations 
the following sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain components of ventiv s statement of operations  including such data stated as a percentage of revenues 
for the years ending december  in thousands revenues    costs of services    selling  general administrative expenses    recapitalization costs 
 acquisition and related costs   restructuring charges    earnings losses from operations    interest expense   investment income    earnings losses before income taxes    income tax provision benefit   net earnings losses    year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million in  from million in revenues in our us sales business were million  an increase of  or million  over  and accounted for of total ventiv revenues in this growth primarily resulted from new contracts and expansions of existing business relationships with bristol myers squibb  inc bms  forest labs  johnson johnson and novartis 
us sales revenues and operating income for the year ended december  included approximately million of incentive fees  incentive fees recognized in the comparable prior year period were negligible 
in august  the us sales business entered into a significant multi year contract with bms 
the current relationship with bms is scheduled to transition from a fixed plus incentive fee arrangement to a revenue sharing arrangement beginning in january  where the payments made to ventiv will be entirely determined as a percentage of the revenue stream from the products supported 
ventiv has reached an agreement in principle with bms  which revises the basis for total compensation to be paid to ventiv for the promotion of bms products 
the revised arrangement with bms also shifts the physician focus and reduces the size of the overall sales force 
this new arrangement with bms will reduce revenue levels earned under this contract in ventiv s european sales business generated revenues of million in  a decrease of from revenues generated by the european businesses represented of total revenues for the year ended december  the decline in revenue was a result of a combination of factors including client losses following the integration of certain acquired ventiv businesses  the closure of syndicated sales forces primarily in the uk and  to a lesser extent  the impact of foreign exchange rates 
ventiv health communications revenue represented of the company s total revenues 
revenues from this business were approximately million for the year ended december  which represents an increase of million or from the million of revenue recorded in this increase was attributable to the shift of business focus away from print media toward live events  beginning in the third quarter of live events meetings  teleconferences  symposia  etc 
are typically large scale engagements with higher contract values 
in addition  margins on such engagements are typically lower than those earned on print media business  which require a higher degree of specialized effort 
health products research generated of total revenues in revenues increased million or  to million from million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues was primarily a result of an expansion of the group s client base  partially offset by the effects of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry 
such consolidation created additional demand for certain services in fiscal which did not recur in costs of services costs of services increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  costs of services increased by approximately less than the growth in revenues for costs of services decreased as a percentage of revenue to approximately in from in the costs of services were lower as a percentage of revenue in compared to primarily as a result of incentive fee revenue earned by the us sales business 
these incentive fees increase revenue without a corresponding increase in the cost of services 
the benefit of these incentive fees was partially offset as the costs of services for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by approximately million of one time charges  which were recorded as part of ongoing operations 
these charges related primarily to a reduction in syndicated salesforce capacity in the uk based contract sales business and to efforts to reduce headcount and other fixed costs in ventiv health communications 
the effect of these charges was partially offset by higher margins from the us sales business  which included the effect of incentive fees from several clients 
the costs of services for were affected in the third quarter by the one time costs incurred with respect to the start up of the bms contract 
we believe that the actions taken this year and late in  including the reduction of syndicated sales force capacity in the uk and other cost reduction initiatives  will continue to benefit future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to from 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of savings generated by the integration actions taken during and management restructuring efforts in see restructuring charges below 
the savings generated by the above actions were partially offset by additional ongoing overhead expenses  beginning in the third quarter of  related to the formation of ventiv s independent management and administrative infrastructure following the distribution of the company s common stock 
decreases were offset in part in by the company s investments related to e ventiv  ventiv integrated solutions and other new business development initiatives 
recapitalization costs during  ventiv recorded million of recapitalization costs in connection with the spin off from snc 
this cost consisted of non cash charges related to restricted stock  issued to certain key employees of ventiv  which partially vested immediately following the distribution of ventiv s common stock 
there was no similar charge in acquisition and related costs during  the company recorded million in non recurring acquisition and related costs with regard to a payment made by ventiv  in the form of  shares of ventiv common stock  to the prior owners of promotech research associates  inc promotech  in exchange for the release of any and all claims against snc and ventiv related to the purchase of promotech 
promotech was acquired in march the additional payment was not provided for in the purchase agreement and could not be considered a part of the purchase price for accounting purposes 
there were no similar costs in restructuring charges during  management completed an evaluation of staffing levels and infrastructure of its european operations 
following this evaluation  management adopted a restructuring plan which provided for i rationalization of senior and mid level management in france  the united kingdom and austria total of employees  ii early termination of leases in france and austria to reduce overall facilities costs and consolidate certain sales operation  respectively  and  iii the disposition of assets not associated with ventiv s core businesses 
in addition  ventiv uk incurred charges related to the closure of a sales team with a specific client 
ventiv uk does not intend to create sales teams of a similar nature in the forseeable future 
the closure of this team resulted in the termination of employees 
the total charge related to the european operations was approximately million 
the company also completed an evaluation of the operations at ventiv health communications 
as a result of this evaluation  a plan was implemented to restructure this business unit s operations 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  which provided for i rationalization of management and staff positions total of employees  ii early termination of leases to reduce overall facilities costs and  iii the disposition of assets related to the early termination of leases 
during  the company accrued and expensed approximately million related to employee termination benefits 
the company had paid approximately million of this amount by december  charges recorded in included million of costs related to the consolidation and integration of certain of ventiv s acquired operations in the us  us and france under the company s plan initiated in the charge consisted of million in severance and related payments associated with the termination of employees  and million in consulting services and other costs related to these integration activities 
the total costs of million were partially offset by a reduction of million for previously recorded charges due to changes in estimates 
interest expense ventiv recorded million of interest expense in the year ended december   a notable increase over the million recorded in interest expense increased as a direct result of net borrowings drawn against the company s revolving line of credit  in support of operations  investing activities and in connection with the company s share repurchase program 
see liquidity and capital resources 
interest expense was also higher due to the leasing of an auto fleet at the us sales business 
these leases are capital in nature 
investment income ventiv recorded approximately million and million of investment income in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income reflected the benefits from management s efforts to centralize treasury functions for its us operations  allowing for more timely and effective concentration and investment of cash balances 
variations in future investment income will result from differences in average amounts of cash and cash equivalents available for investment and the prevailing short term interest rates during these periods 
income tax provision benefit ventiv recorded provisions for income taxes at an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  ventiv s effective tax rate reflected the full impact of non deductible goodwill amortization associated with prior acquisitions  net of benefit derived from the use of certain tax loss carryforwards from prior years 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a tax benefit at an average effective rate of on a net book loss  due primarily to non deductible goodwill amortization and other non recurring acquisition and related costs 
net earnings and earnings per share eps ventiv s net earnings increased by million to million for the year ending december   from a loss of million for the year ended december   as more fully described above 
shares used in computing basic and diluted eps decreased by approximately million and million shares  respectively  due to the impact of the company s share repurchase program 
the impact of share repurchases on shares used in computing diluted eps was offset in part by the inclusion of common stock equivalents relating to employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
these items were not included in pro forma diluted eps for the year ended december   as they were anti dilutive to the net loss per share and were not issued until the date of the distribution see part ii
