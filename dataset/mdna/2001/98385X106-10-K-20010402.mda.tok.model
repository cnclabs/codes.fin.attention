item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  general product prices 
federal and state regulations there have been  and continue to be  numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect the company 
the company cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january  and none of the company s gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
the company cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from the company s properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing the company s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of the company s oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
the united states court of appeals upheld ferc s orders in these rules have had little effect on the company s oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled 
the company may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering similar regulations 
new regulations have not had a material effect on the operations of the company s gathering systems  but the company cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on its gathering systems 
federal  state or native american leases the company s operations on federal  state or native american oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact the company s operations and costs 
management believes that the company is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  the company has not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company

item legal proceedings on april   a class action lawsuit  styled booth  et al 
v 
cross timbers oil company  was filed against the company in the district court of dewey county  oklahoma 
the action was filed on behalf of all persons who  at any time since june  have been paid royalties on gas produced from any gas well within the state of oklahoma under which the company has assumed the obligation to pay royalties 
the plaintiffs allege that the company has reduced royalty payments by post production deductions and has entered into contracts with subsidiaries that were not arm s length transactions 
the plaintiffs further allege that these actions reduced the royalties paid to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated  and that such actions are a breach of the leases under which the royalties are paid 
these deductions allegedly include production and post production costs  marketing costs  administration costs and costs incurred by the company in gathering  compressing  dehydrating  processing  treating  blending and or transporting the gas produced 
the company contends that  to the extent any fees are proportionately borne by the plaintiffs  these fees are established by arm s length negotiations with third parties or  if charged by affiliates  are comparable to fees charged by third party gatherers or processors 
the company further contends that any such fees enhance the value of the gas or the products derived from the gas 
the plaintiffs are seeking an accounting and payment of the monies allegedly owed to them 
a hearing on the class certification issue has not been scheduled 
management believes it has strong defenses against this claim and intends to vigorously defend the action 
management s estimate of the potential liability from this claim has been accrued in the company s financial statements 
on october   an action  styled united states of america ex rel 
grynberg v 
cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the u 
s 
district court for the western district of oklahoma against the company and certain of its subsidiaries by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act 
the plaintiff alleges that the company underpaid royalties on gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans by at least during the past years as a result of mismeasuring the volume of gas and incorrectly analyzing its heating content 
the plaintiff has made similar allegations in over actions filed against more than other companies 
the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of royalties not paid  together with treble damages  a civil penalty of  to  for each violation and attorney fees and expenses 
the plaintiff also seeks an order for the company to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices 
after its review  the department of justice decided in april not to intervene and asked the court to unseal the case 
the court unsealed the case in may a multi district litigation panel ordered that the lawsuits against the company and other companies filed by grynberg be transferred and consolidated to the federal district court in wyoming 
the company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss which has been heard by the court and a decision is pending 
the company believes that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim is not currently determinable and no provision has been accrued in the company s financial statements 
a third lawsuit  bishop  et al 
v 
amoco production co  et al  was filed in may in the third judicial district court in lincoln county  wyoming by owners of royalty and overriding royalty interests in wells located in wyoming 
the plaintiffs alleged that the company and the other producer defendants deducted impermissible costs of production from royalty payments that were made to the plaintiffs and other similarly situated persons and failed to properly inform the plaintiffs and others of the deductions taken as allegedly required by wyoming statutes 
the action was brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who own an interest in wells located in wyoming as to which the defendants pay royalties and overriding royalties 
the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the deductions made were impermissible and sought damages in the amount of the deductions made  together with interest and attorneys fees 
the company has reached a settlement of this action  which is subject to court approval 
the company has agreed to pay a total settlement amount of  for a release of claims relating to deductions taken by the company  the statutory reporting of claims  and other miscellaneous matters 
the company further agreed that it would not take similar deductions from royalty owners in the future and to itemize other deductions from future royalty disbursements 
the company expects that the court will approve the settlement in april the settlement was accrued in the company s financial statements 
in february  the department of interior notified the company and several other producers that certain native american leases located in the san juan basin have expired due to the failure of the leases to produce in paying quantities 
the department of interior has demanded abandonment of the property as well as payment of the gross proceeds from the wells minus royalties paid from the date of the alleged cessation of production to present 
the company has filed a notice of appeal with the interior board of indian appeals 
the potential loss from these claims is currently not determinable  but could be material to the company s annual earnings 
the company believes that the claim is without merit and that there is currently not a probable loss 
no related provision is accrued in the company s financial statements 
the company is involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
company management and legal counsel do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims  including the lawsuits described above  will have a material effect on the company s financial position or liquidity  although an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the operations of a given interim period or year

exploration activity has been primarily geological and geophysical analysis  including seismic studies  of undeveloped properties 
exploratory expenditures were million in   in and million in development and exploration program 
the company has budgeted million for its development and exploration program  which is expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations 
the company anticipates exploration expenditures will be approximately of the budget

investment in equity securities 
in  the company purchased what it believed to be undervalued oil and gas reserves by acquiring common stock of publicly traded independent oil and gas producers at a total cost of million 
for accounting purposes  the company considered equity securities purchased in to be trading securities since they were purchased with the intent to resell in the near future  and therefore recognized unrealized investment gains and losses in the income statements 
after selling a portion of these securities in and  the company sold its remaining investment in equity securities in for million 
the company recognized a million gain in  and losses of million in and million in related to this investment 
derivative fair value loss

product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other fluctuations the company generally cannot control or predict 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
starting at about per barrel  crude oil prices declined throughout  dropping to a posted west texas intermediate wti price of per barrel in december  the lowest level since oil prices increased in because of production cuts by opec and other leading oil exporters  reduced inventories and anticipated increased demand 
despite opec production increases in  increased demand has sustained higher prices 
in september  posted wti prices reached  their highest levels since the persian gulf war 
in response to lower prices in caused by lagging demand  opec members announced their resolve to maintain higher oil prices through production cuts when needed 
the company uses commodity price hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to oil price fluctuations 
including the effect of these hedging instruments  the company s average oil price decreased from to in and from to in based on production  the company estimates that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
natural gas prices are influenced by north american supply and demand  which is often dependent upon weather conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
gas prices were approximately per mmbtu in january and remained lower throughout the year because of mild winters in the central and eastern us cooler spring weather and lower industry production levels strengthened gas prices in and  after declining briefly at the end of  continued to strengthen in the combination of lower domestic productive capacity  reduced storage and increased summer and winter demand have resulted in higher natural gas prices with increased volatility 
nymex gas prices reached a record high of in december at march   the average nymex price for the following months was per mmbtu 
the company uses commodity price hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to gas price fluctuations 
including the effect of these hedging instruments  the company s average gas price decreased from to in and from to in based on production  the company estimates that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in approximately an million change in annual operating cash flow 
however  a significant portion of the company s gas production through march is hedged by contracts that effectively fix prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment provision 
during  the company recorded an impairment provision on producing properties of million before income tax 
this impairment provision was determined based on an assessment of recoverability of net property costs from estimated future net cash flows from those properties 
estimated future net cash flows are based on management s best estimate of projected oil and gas reserves and prices 
if oil and gas prices significantly decline  the company may be required to record impairment provisions in the future  which could be material

general and administrative expense increased  or  because of increased expenses from company growth related to the and acquisitions 
excluding incentive compensation  general and administrative expense per mcfe remained at in interest expense increased million  or  primarily because of a comparable increase in weighted average borrowings to partially fund the and acquisitions 
interest related to investment in equity securities has been classified as part of the loss on investment in equity securities 
interest expense per mcfe increased slightly from in to in liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities  producing property sales  including sales of royalty trust units  public offerings of equity and debt  and bank debt 
other than for operations  the company s cash requirements are generally for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  and debt and dividend payments 
exploration and development expenditures and dividend payments have generally been funded by cash flow from operations 
the company believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to fund its cash requirements in cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million cash used by operations in fluctuations during this three year period were primarily because of purchases of equity securities and lower product prices in and increased prices and production from acquisitions and development activity in and before changes in operating assets and liabilities and exploration expense  cash flow from operations was million in  million in and million in financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of higher product prices and company growth related to the acquisitions 
as of december   total capitalization of the company was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was also billion  but was long term debt 
the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is because of repayment of debt from cash flow and the sale of common stock 
working capital the company generally uses available cash to reduce bank debt and  therefore  does not maintain large cash and cash equivalent balances 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since the company s principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  the company often has low or negative working capital 
the decrease in working capital from million at december  to negative working capital of million at december  was primarily attributable to the sale of equity security investments and increased current liabilities  net of the increase in current deferred income tax benefit  related to the derivative fair value loss 
included in other current liabilities at december  is a million derivative loss accrual for the fair value of call options sold in related to the company s hedging activities 
beginning january   the company will also accrue fair value losses related to unrealized hedge derivative losses and a gas delivery contract 
see accounting changes below 
the company expects that any cash settlement of these derivative losses should be offset by increased cash flows from the company s sale of related production 
therefore  the company believes that substantially all derivative fair value gains and losses are offset by changes in value of its natural gas reserves 
this offsetting change in gas reserve value  however  is not reflected in working capital 
prior to their sale  equity securities owned by the company had been held in a painewebber broker account and provided support for officer margin debt 
as of march  officer margin debt balances related to company common stock were fully repaid  and the margin support agreements were terminated because they were no longer needed 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
financing in may  the company entered a new revolving credit agreement with commercial banks with a commitment of million 
proceeds of this loan agreement were used to refinance the company s previous senior credit facility and to fully repay a million term loan and the separate bank debt of the company s subsidiaries  spring holding company and summer acquisition company 
in june  the loan agreement was amended to allow the company to issue letters of credit 
any letters of credit outstanding reduce the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
borrowings at december  under the loan agreement were million with unused borrowing capacity of million 
the borrowing base is redetermined annually based on the value and expected cash flow of the company s proved oil and gas reserves 
if borrowings exceed the redetermined borrowing base  the banks may require that the excess be repaid within a year 
based on reserve values at december  and parameters specified by the banks  the borrowing base supports borrowings in excess of the million commitment 
borrowings under the loan agreement are due may   but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the company periodically renegotiates the loan agreement to increase the borrowing commitment and extend the revolving facility 
in february  the loan agreement was amended to allow the repurchase of the company s subordinated debt and to increase commodity hedging limits 
on january   the company purchased primarily gas producing properties in east texas and louisiana for million  of which million had been paid in this acquisition was funded through borrowings under the loan agreement which are expected to be repaid from cash flow during the first six months of the and acquisitions were partially funded by the sale and issuance of common stock and cash flow from operations 
the acquisitions were also partially funded by contributions from lehman  the company s equity partner until the company later purchased lehman s interest in these acquisitions 
these transactions are described under general above

capital expenditures because of their size  the acquisitions were made jointly with lehman as a equity partner 
pursuant to its call option  the company acquired lehman s interest in the spring holding acquisition in september the company exercised its option to purchase lehman s interest in the ocean energy acquisition on march  for million  funded primarily by the proceeds from sales of property and equity security investments 
the company plans to fund any future property acquisitions through a combination of cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales  bank debt  public equity or debt transactions 
there are no restrictions under the company s revolving credit agreement that would affect the company s ability to use its remaining borrowing capacity for acquisitions of producing properties 
in february  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of the company s common stock 
upon completion of repurchases under this authorization  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares in may 
during  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at a cost of million  including million shares repurchased under a prior board authorization 
as of march   million shares are available for repurchase under the may board authorization 
in  exploration and development cash expenditures totaled million compared with million in the company has budgeted million for the development program 
as it has done historically  the company expects to fund the development program with cash flow from operations 
since there are no material long term commitments associated with this budget  the company has the flexibility to adjust its actual development expenditures in response to changes in product prices  industry conditions and the effects of the company s acquisition and development programs 
a minor portion of the company s existing properties are operated by third parties which control the timing and amount of expenditures required to exploit the company s interests in such properties 
therefore  the company cannot assure the timing or amount of these expenditures 
to date  the company has not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and it does not expect to do so during however  developments such as new regulations  enforcement policies or claims for damages could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share in  per common share from through second quarter and per common share for the third and fourth quarters of the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon available cash flow  as well as other factors 
in addition  the company s bank loan agreement restricts the amount of common stock dividends to of cash flow from operations  as defined  for the last four quarters 
cumulative dividends on series a convertible preferred stock are paid quarterly  when declared by the board of directors  based on an annual rate of per share 
pursuant to the company s notice of preferred stock redemption  all preferred stock was converted into common shares prior to march accounting changes effective january   the company has adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and sfas no 
requires the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
change in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges  as well as the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives  must be recognized as a derivative fair value gain or loss in the income statement 
change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs 
physical delivery contracts which cannot be net cash settled are deemed to be normal sales and therefore are not accounted for as derivatives 
however  physical delivery contracts that have a price not clearly and closely associated with the asset sold are not a normal sale and must be accounted for as a non hedge derivative 
the company accounted for adoption of sfas no 
on january  by recording a one time after tax charge of million in the income statement for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  and an unrealized after tax loss of million in other comprehensive income 
the charge to the income statement is primarily related to the company s physical delivery contract to sell  mcf of natural gas per day from through july at crude oil based prices 
the unrealized loss is related to the derivative fair value of cash flow hedges 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded on the balance sheet at january  were a million current liability  a million long term asset and a million long term liability related to the fair value of derivatives  and a current deferred tax asset of million and a reduction to the long term tax liability of million for the related tax benefits 
as oil and gas prices fluctuate  the company will recognize a derivative fair value gain or loss in its consolidated income statement related to the gas physical delivery contract with crude oil based pricing  as well as written call options 
the opportunity loss  related to market gas prices exceeding the prices provided by these contracts  is immediately recognized as a loss in derivative fair value in the income statement 
this contrasts with opportunity losses on hedge derivative contracts which are recorded as an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income and later recognized in the income statement when the related sale occurs 
since there is no net cash settlement expected under the gas physical delivery contract  any losses recognized under this contract will be reversed into income when gas is delivered 
in all other cases  derivative losses should be offset by increased cash flows from the company s later sale of related production 
accordingly  the company believes that substantially all derivative fair value gains and losses will be offset by changes in the value of its natural gas reserves 
this offsetting change in gas reserve value  however  is not reflected in the company s financial statements 
see item a  commodity price risk for the effect of price changes on derivative fair value gains and losses 
production imbalances the company has gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a net current asset of million for a net underproduced balancing position of  mcf of natural gas  and a net long term liability of million for an overproduced balancing position of  mcf of natural gas  net of an underproduced balancing position of  mcf of carbon dioxide 
production imbalances do not have  and are not expected to have  a significant impact on the company s liquidity or operations 
forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by the company  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to the company s operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may be or may concern  among other things  capital expenditures  cash flow  drilling activity  acquisition and development activities  pricing differentials  operating costs  production activities  oil  gas and natural gas liquids reserves and prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  liquidity  debt repayment  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  predicts  anticipates  believes  estimates  goal  should  could  assume  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are crude oil and natural gas price fluctuations  changes in interest rates  the company s ability to acquire oil and gas properties that meet its objectives and to identify prospects for drilling  higher than expected production costs and other expenses  potential delays or failure to achieve expected production from existing and future exploration and development projects  volatility of crude oil  natural gas and hydrocarbon based financial derivative prices  basis risk and counterparty credit risk in executing commodity price risk management activities  potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation  competition in the oil and gas industry as well as competition from other sources of energy 
in addition  these forward looking statements may be affected by general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company only enters derivative financial instruments in conjunction with its hedging activities 
these instruments principally include interest rate swap agreements and commodity futures  swaps and option agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of interest rate fluctuations and natural gas and crude oil price changes 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
the board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by the company relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the chairman or the executive vice president administration of all risk management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   the company s variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value  and the company s fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
assuming a one percent  or basis point  change in interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt would change by approximately million 
the company attempts to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate subordinated debt  as well as the use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and interest rate swaps  and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
the hypothetical change in fair value could result in a gain or a loss depending on an increase or decrease in the interest rate 
hypothetical carrying fair change in in thousands amount value fair value december  long term debt    interest rate swaps 
  december  long term debt    interest rate swaps 
  commodity price risk the company hedges a portion of its price risks associated with its crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   the company had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
gas futures contracts and swap agreements would have had a total fair value loss of approximately million at december  and million at december  basis swap agreements had a fair value gain of million at december  and a fair value loss of million at december  the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices and basis would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements and approximately  in the fair value of basis swap agreements at december  this sensitivity does not include the effects of commodity contracts  such as physical product delivery contracts  that cannot be settled in cash or another financial instrument 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with its hedging activities  the company sold call options to sell future gas production at certain ceiling prices 
call options outstanding had a fair value loss of million at december  and  at december  the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices and basis would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these options at december  changes in the fair value of these options are recognized in the consolidated income statements since they do not qualify for hedge accounting 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company has entered a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract is priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it must be accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument under sfas no 
beginning january  see note to consolidated financial statements and accounting changes above 
the pre tax fair value loss of this contract at january  is million 
the effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of this contract  while a change in crude oil prices would result in a change of approximately million
