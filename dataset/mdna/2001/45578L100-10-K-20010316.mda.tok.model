item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and operating results in general  and in particular its revenues from new licenses  are relatively difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including i the relatively long sales cycles for the company s products  ii the variable size and timing of individual license transactions  iii changes in demand for the company s products and services  iv competitive conditions in the industry  v changes in customer budgets  vi the timing of the introduction of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  vii the company s success in and costs associated with developing and introducing new products  viii product life cycles  ix changes in the proportion of revenues attributable to license fees versus services  x the percentage of license fees attributable to third party software  xi changes in the level of operating expenses  xii delay or deferral of customer implementations of the company s software  xiii software defects and other product quality problems  and xiv effect of sec requirements and aicpa statements of position on the company s revenue recognition  xv other economic conditions generally or in specific industry segments

for these and other reasons  the sales cycles for the company s products are typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which the company has little or no control  including customers budget constraints and internal authorization reviews

such delays in the implementation or execution of orders have caused  and may in the future cause  material fluctuations in the company s operating results 
similarly  customers may cancel implementation projects at any time without penalty  and such cancellation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
because the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a small variation in the timing of recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variations in operating results and may in some future period result in losses or have a material and adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations
