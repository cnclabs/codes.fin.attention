ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the white paper provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo
