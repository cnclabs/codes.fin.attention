newmil had negative provisions for loan losses of  and  for the six month periods ended december  and  respectively  due to cash recoveries from a previously charged off loan 
excluding these recoveries  newmil s provision for loan losses would have been and  for the and periods  respectively 
in addition   was added to the allowance in as a result of the nutmeg acquisition 
over the past several years the benefits from a steady improvement in loan quality  offset in part by effect of modest loan portfolio growth  has enabled newmil to reduce its provision for loan losses 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans has declined to at december   compared with   and at june    and  respectively 
the ratio of past due loans including non performing loans to total loans was at december   compared with and at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans of at december  compared with and at june  and  respectively  results from both loan portfolio growth and improvements in credit quality 
during the six months ended december  gross loans increased by million  including million acquired with nutmeg  of which represented to family residential mortgage loans  represented commercial mortgage  commercial and industrial  and residential multifamily loans and represented home equity and other loan categories 
for a discussion on loan quality see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans at december  should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the fdic  in february and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved by the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the allowance for loan losses is computed by taking the portfolio and segregating it into various risk rating categories 
some loans have been further segregated and carry specific reserve amounts 
all other loans that do not have specific reserves assigned are reserved based on a loss percentage assigned to the outstanding balance 
the percentage applied to the outstanding balance varies depending on the risk rating 
in addition the bank maintains an unallocated reserve 
the unallocated reserve declined to  at december  from  at june   principally as a result of the combination of nutmeg s loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses with newmil s 
nutmeg did not maintain an unallocated reserve 
non interest income non interest income increased  or  for the six month period ended december  this increase is attributable to increased revenue from services charges  the elimination of a loss on the sale of securities and offset by a gain from the sale of a branch in the principal categories of non interest income are as follows six months ended december  change dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts gains on sales of loans  net losses on sales of securities  net gain on sale of branch gains on sales of oreo loan servicing other total non interest income  the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in reflects increased transaction volume resulting from both growth in transaction deposit accounts and accounts added with the nutmeg purchase

the decrease in employee benefits in resulted from the recognition of net periodic pension income of  from newmil s frozen defined benefit pension plan the plan   from the settlement of a medical claim dispute with a third party and  in lower medical costs due to changing from a self insured to a fully insured medical plan 
newmil measured net periodic pension cost for the year period under the premise that the plan would be terminated sometime in fiscal during the quarter ended december   newmil made a strategic decision not to terminate the plan and to continue the plan in a frozen status 
this change in strategy was deemed a significant event per paragraph of sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions which necessitated a change in measurement assumptions 
these different measurement assumptions resulted in  of pension income in as compared with in the increase in occupancy and equipment expense was due to higher depreciation expense and equipment and building maintenance expense associated with the nutmeg purchase 
marketing expense increased as a result of advertising campaigns to promote the bank s name change and the acquisition of nutmeg 
the increase in professional fees was principally associated with the change in the fiscal year end 
the increase in printing and office supplies resulted from both the bank s name change and the nutmeg acquisition

the amortization of intangible assets relates to the acquisition of nutmeg  accounted for as a purchase transaction 
changes in postage and telecommunications and other operating expenses reflect the recent growth in the bank s assets and the nutmeg acquisition

the department also works extensively with several government assisted lending programs 
the residential mortgage department  in addition to traditional portfolio lending  originates loans for sale to the secondary market on a service released basis  which enables the bank to offer a very comprehensive residential mortgage product line 
the department also offers home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer installment loans 
the principal categories of the loan portfolio are as follows december  june  june  in thousands real estate mortgages residential to family    or more family    commercial    land land development    home equity credit    total mortgage loans    commercial industrial    installment other    total loans  gross    deferred loan origination fees and purchase premium  net allowance for loan losses    total loans  net    june  june  june  in thousands real estate mortgages residential to family    or more family    commercial    land land development    home equity credit    total mortgage loans    commercial industrial    installment other    total loans  gross    deferred loan origination fees and purchase premium  net allowance for loan losses    total loans  net    the loan portfolio s maturity distribution is as follows non accrual loans have been presented in the after years category december  within after in thousands within year years years total real estate mortgages residential to family     or more family     commercial     land land development    home equity credit     commercial industrial     installment other    total loans  gross     the amount of loans due after one year that have fixed interest rates and variable or adjustable interest rates are as follows december  fixed adjustable in thousands interest interest rates rates real estate mortgages to family residential   or more family residential   commercial   land land development  home equity credit  commercial and industrial   installment  collateral other  total loans  gross   non performing assets the principal categories of non performing assets are as follows december  june  june  in thousands non accruing loans   accruing loans past due days or more accruing restructured loans total non performing loans   oreo  net total non performing assets    december  june  june  june  in thousands non accruing loans   accruing loans past due days or more accruing restructured loans total non performing loans    oreo  net  total non performing assets    the composition of non performing assets is as follows non performing assets real estate dollars in thousands land land residential commercial development total december  non accrual loans  accruing loans past due or more days restructured loans other real estate owned totals  june  non accrual loans accruing loans past due or more days restructured loans other real estate owned totals  june  non accrual loans  accruing loans past due or more days restructured loans other real estate owned totals  during the six month period ended december  non performing assets increased  to million at december   primarily due to the nutmeg acquisition 
however  non performing assets represent only of total assets at december   compared with at june  the low level of non performing assets reflects newmil s rigorous ongoing credit management process and favorable economic climate 
changes in non performing assets are as follows six months ended years ended december  june  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of period    loans placed on non accrual status non accrual loans acquired with nutmeg non accrual loan payments loans returned to accrual status non accrual loan charge offs change in accruing loans past due or more days  net payments to improve oreo decrease in oreo valuation reserve gross proceeds from oreo sales  gains on oreo sales  net  balance  end of period    percent of total assets had non accrual loans as of december  and june  and been current in accordance with their original terms  gross interest income of   and  respectively  would have been recorded in net income 
the amount of interest on these loans that was included in income was   and  respectively  for the three periods 
accruing loans past due days or more at december  consist of mortgage loans in the process of collection and where the collection of accrued interest is probable 
newmil pursues the resolution of all non performing assets through restructurings  credit enhancements or collections 
when collection procedures do not bring a loan into performing or restructured status  newmil generally initiates action to foreclose the property or to acquire it by deed in lieu of foreclosure 
newmil actively markets all oreo and during the six months ended december  sold  of oreo from which net gains of  were realized 
in addition to non performing assets  at december  newmil had  of performing classified loans that are considered potential problem loans 
although not impaired  performing classified loans  in the opinion of management  exhibit a higher than normal degree of risk and warrant monitoring due to various considerations  including i the degree of documentation supporting the borrower s current financial position  ii potential weaknesses in the borrowers ability to service the loan  iii possible collateral value deficiency  and iv other risk factors such as geographic location  industry focus and negatively trending financial results 
these deficiencies create some uncertainty  but not serious doubt  as to the borrowers ability to comply with the loan repayment terms in the future 
management believes that reserves for these loans are adequate 
deposits and borrowings during the six month period ended december  deposits grew million  or  to million 
this was due both to the purchase of nutmeg  with deposits of million and four full service branch offices  and to deposit growth of million 
the deposit growth is attributed to an extensive advertising campaign by the bank and changes in the bank s market resulting from the sale of a competing community bank to a large out of state bank 
newmil has full service branch offices and one special needs office located in fairfield  litchfield and new haven counties 
the scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit with balances in excess of  are as follows december  less within within over in thousands than one months months months year total certificates of deposit over       during the six month period ended december  borrowings decreased to million 
the decrease was funded by newmil s deposit growth  offset by cash paid for the nutmeg acquisition and borrowings of million assumed from nutmeg 
borrowings at december  consisted of overnight repurchase agreements of million  and federal home loan bank advances of million with terms ranging from one day to months and fixed rates ranging from to 
borrowings at june  had terms ranging from one day to nine months and fixed rates from to 
liquidity newmil manages its liquidity position to ensure that there is sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals  new loan originations  securities purchases and other operating cash outflows 
the primary sources of liquidity are principal payments and maturities of securities and loans  short term borrowings through repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances  net deposit growth and funds provided by operations 
liquidity can also be provided through sales of loans and available for sale securities 
operating activities for the six month period ended december  provided net cash flows of million 
during investing activities used net cash of million  principally net cash paid through the nutmeg acquisition and net loan advances 
financing activities provided net cash of million  principally from increased deposits and repurchase agreements  offset by net borrowing repayments 
funds provided by operating activities and financing activities were utilized to fund investing activities and a million increase in cash and overnight federal funds sold 
operating activities for the six month period ended december  used net cash of million 
investing activities provided net cash of million  principally as a result of securities repayments  sales and maturities offset  in part  by securities and loans purchased 
financing activities used net cash of million  principally due to repayment of borrowings  net deposit withdrawals  dividends paid and treasury stock purchases 
funds provided by investing activities  together with a million decrease in cash and overnight federal funds sold  were utilized to fund financing activities 
at december   newmil s liquidity ratio  as represented by cash  short term available for sale securities  marketable assets  the ability to borrow against held to maturity securities and loans through unused fhlb and other short term borrowing capacity  of approximately million  to net deposits and short term unsecured liabilities  was  well in excess of newmil s minimum guideline of 
at december   newmil had outstanding commitments to fund new loan originations of million  construction mortgage commitments of million and unused lines of credit of million 
these commitments will be met in the normal course of business 
newmil believes that its liquidity sources will continue to provide funding sufficient to support operating activities  loan originations and commitments  and deposit withdrawals 
asset liability management and market risk newmil manages interest rate risk through an asset liability committee comprised of representatives from senior management and the board of directors 
the committee monitors exposure to interest rate risk on a quarterly basis using both a traditional gap analysis and an earnings simulation analysis 
traditional gap analysis identifies short and long term interest rate positions or exposure 
simulation analysis measures the amount of short term earnings at risk under both rising and falling rate scenarios 
newmil manages interest rate risk with the objective of maintaining a high and stable net interest margin under changing interest rate environments 
interest rate risk is measured using gap analysis  to identify short medium and long term interest rate risk positions  and simulation analysis  to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
newmil seeks to manage interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth newmil s interest rate sensitivity position  or gap position  at december   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market and savings deposits have been presented in the within month category and now account deposits have been presented in the after year category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

a liability sensitive gap implies that newmil s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
newmil simulates earnings at risk over a twelve month horizon by ramping interest rates basis points from the current rate environment 
during the year ended december  interest rates did not move basis points from their current rates 
newmil s asset liability management responds to changes in interest rates and market conditions 
the simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
newmil s policy is to ensure that the change in net income over the twelve month horizon within the basis point band will not decrease by or more 
the following table indicates that the estimated percentage change in net income over the next twelve month forecast horizon was within newmil s tolerance limit for the periods presented 
change in rate change in net income december  june  june  bp bp due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
capital resources during the six month period ended december  shareholders equity increased million  or  to million  while book value per share increased to at december  the increase in shareholders equity resulted from net income of  common stock of million issued in consideration for the purchase of nutmeg  net unrealized gains of million on securities available for sale  net of taxes  a  tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  offset  in part  by treasury stock purchases of  and dividend payments of  repurchases of common stock during the six month period ended december  newmil repurchased  shares of common stock for total consideration of  or per average share  under a  share repurchase plan announced in december and a  share repurchase plan announced in february as of december  newmil had repurchased  shares under the december plan and  shares under the february plan 
in december newmil announced its intention to repurchase  or  of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market and unsolicited negotiated transactions  including block purchases 
the purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset the future dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of stock options under newmil s stock option plans  and for general corporate purposes 
capital requirements newmil and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements established  respectively  by the federal reserve board the frb and the fdic 
at december  newmil s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
at december  the bank s leverage capital  and tier i and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively 
at june  the bank s leverage capital  and tier i and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the bank s capital ratios at december  resulted from the acquisition of nutmeg 
in addition  newmil s intangible assets acquired pursuant to the nutmeg purchase transaction are not recognized for regulatory capital 
newmil and the bank are categorized as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier i risk based ratio of or above and a leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
dividend restrictions newmil s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to newmil 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to newmil 
under connecticut law a bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net profit for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to newmil at december  was  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on newmil by the frb 
in october newmil resumed dividend payments with the payment of a quarterly cash dividend  following a four year lapse 
in october   and newmil increased its quarterly cash dividend to   and  respectively 
in july newmil increased its quarterly dividend to 
for the six month period ended december  total dividends of per share were paid 
newmil believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers newmil s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of newmil or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by newmil will be dependent on newmil s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of newmil 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas 
it revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it carries over most of sfas provisions without reconsideration 
this statement will be effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march  management anticipates that sfas will not have a significant effect on newmil s results of operations or its financial position based on its current operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
