summary net income for bar harbor bankshares for the year was million  which represents per share of common stock  compared with million  or per share in this past year was an eventful one that included several value building initiatives that represent investments in the future but caused reductions in net income in bti financial group became operative in january through the spin off of the trust and investment management business of bar harbor banking and trust company and the purchase of dirigo investments  inc while there were various start up expenses associated with this wholly owned subsidiary  bti s fee income  including dirigo  increased over trust income recognized by the company in during the second quarter of  the bank completed a company wide computer software conversion to a new comprehensive  integrated system 
while the conversion caused some operational disruption and additional expense  this enhanced system should generate identifiable operating benefits in the future 
a further decrease in earnings resulted from the leveraging strategy of the investment portfolio in and early this growth of the portfolio was funded by short term borrowings which caused a compression of the net interest income generated from these investments in the rising rate environment throughout much of the bank s provision for possible loan losses rose by  to  in this increase was necessary to provide an adequate reserve for possible loan losses 
during  the company experienced a increase in average loans from million in to million in and the investment portfolio average balance increased from million in to million in funding this growth were a modest million increase in average deposits and a million increase in average borrowing from the federal home loan bank 
loans the increase in average loans between and was in all loan categories with the exception of a modest decrease in construction and development and agricultural lending 
mortgages showed the greatest increase during with an million increase from in  consumer loans  including residential mortgages  comprised approximately of the loan portfolio  a slight increase from last year 
this increase is bolstered by the increased activity in consumer mortgages 
the yield on the loan portfolio in increased basis points in from  in large measure due to a basis point increase in the national prime rate during about of the bank s loan portfolio is subject to repricing within a twelve month period although factors such as competition  changes in loan mix  collateral strength and other variables do not allow a direct relationship with changes in federal reserve bank influenced rates 
the increase in portfolio yield to along with the million increase in the average portfolio generated a million increase in interest income from the loan portfolio in over this interest income increase was million due to volume and 
million due in increase in rate 
loan concentrations continue to reflect the company s business region 
approximately or million of the portfolio is represented by loans to the hospitality industry 
this is consistent with previous years 
other concentrations in lesser amounts include manufacturing  fishing  retail and wholesale trade  and real estate development and construction 
the bank s underwriting process uses conservative loan to value ratios and state and federal government guarantee programs where appropriate 
in addition to loans to consumers and commercial customers  the bank originates and sells or participates in loans to other lenders and investors 
the sale of loans allows the bank to make more funds available to its customers in its service area  while the servicing provides income 
in  loans serviced totaled million compared to million in the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb possible loan losses based on evaluation of their collectibility and prior loss experience 
the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  specific problem loans  and current and anticipated economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance based on their judgements about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank s allowance for possible loan losses was of total loans at the end of this compares to the bank s peer group average allowance ratio of as published through the uniform bank performance report 
each quarter  management prepares and the board of directors approves a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio to ensure there are adequate reserves for potential losses 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplementary reserves to reflect current economic conditions  credit concentrations  industry concentrations  and loan policy changes 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas no

if any portion of the outstanding principal of a loan is considered uncollectable  the portion of the loan not collateralized is charged off 
depending upon the circumstances  loans may or may not be pursued for collection after being charged off 
when a real estate loan goes to foreclosure and the bank buys the property  the property is transferred from the loan portfolio to the other real estate owned oreo portfolio at its fair value 
if the loan balance is higher than the fair value of the property  the difference is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of the transfer 
along with using conservative valuations of oreo properties  reserves are established to allow for selling expenses that can be reasonably estimated

the objectives of the bank s investment strategy for this portfolio is to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity  diversify earning assets  control interest rate risk  and generate acceptable levels of interest income 
the bank s investment securities are classified in one of two categories available for sale and held to maturity 
investment securities classified as available for sale are required to be reported at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings but shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
securities classified in this category comprise of the portfolio at december  held to maturity securities  which comprise of the portfolio  are reported at amortized cost 
on january   the bank  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and repositioned a significant part of the investment portfolio from held to maturity to available for sale 
at december   the investment portfolio was million  million less than the balance at year end 
the overall yield of the portfolio in was compared to in this basis point increase is attributable primarily to the purchase of securities in and early during a period of rising interest rates 
in the latter part of  the bank curtailed new purchases of securities  instead diverting maturities  paydowns  and interest to operating purposes and the paydown of non deposit borrowings

average earnings assets which include loans  investment securities  and short term investments increased million  while december  balances increased a more modest million 
to fund this average increase in earning assets during  the bank relied on increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
average borrowings from the fhlb during were million greater than the average borrowings in at december  fhlb outstandings were million greater than december  the bank is focused on reducing fhlb indebtedness  and funding loan growth through deposit growth and cash flow from maturing investment securities

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of the company s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income 
net interest income in decreased  or  from although average earning assets increased million 
the yield on earning assets in increased from to  which  with the increase in volume  increased interest income million  or  in from offsetting this was the increased cost of interest bearing deposits of  or basis points  over and the increased cost of fhlb and overnight borrowings of million in over this is attributed to an basis point increase in average rate paid on fhlb borrowings which was directly influenced by a basis point increase in the federal funds targeted rate  and a million increase in average borrowings from this million increase in average borrowings almost mirrors the million increase in average earnings assets 
a principal reason for the increased borrowings was to fund increases in the loan portfolio which had an average increase of million during from and to leverage the average investment portfolio balance which increased million between years 
since deposits increased only modestly to fund this increase in earning assets  the strategy was to increase fhlb borrowings which was a more expensive source of funding than deposits 
this compression of net interest income was also evident in the net interest margin which is the ratio of net interest income divided by earning assets 
this ratio declined from in to in the following schedules provide detail of changes in interest income  interest expense  and net interest income due to changes in volume and rate

non interest income for was  more than included in other service charges  commissions and fees are fees generated from the bank s various electronic card programs  visa  merchant programs  atm  and check card fees 
collectively  other service charges  commissions  and fees earned  more before expenses than in the previous year 
security gains of  representing closure on portions of the bank s investment in a regional venture capital fund were taken in with only minor gains taken in non interest expense non interest expense increased million  or in from principally due to additional expenses associated with dirigo and the formation of bti and its subsequent expansion into bangor  maine  a computer software conversion of the core operating system and its principal applications  additions of key staff throughout the company to take advantage of future opportunities  additions to credit administration that are expected to reduce future collection costs and charge offs  and performance training throughout the company 
much of this increase in expense is reflected in salaries and benefits which increased in over after excluding from comparison a one time expense of  related to the non qualified supplemental retirement plan of a former officer 
the addition of dirigo investments  inc  added  of salary related expenses in that were not incurred in other increases in include overtime pay associated with the computer conversion  salaries related to the forming of a more comprehensive credit administration function  additional bti staff  particularly in the areas of investment management and customer service  and key executive management positions that included some transitional overlap 
occupancy increased because of expanded office space for bti and its subsidiaries  and higher utility costs because of escalating utility prices 
furniture and equipment expense increased  primarily due to higher technology costs related to the enhanced operating software that was acquired in other operating expenses included increases in consulting fees related to the software conversion and other operational improvements  office supplies related to new computer forms  and the operations of bti  losses on the disposal of fixed assets  particularly obsolete computer equipment 
non interest expenses for were million or more than the major increases were salaries and benefits which included the  mentioned previously and other operating expenses which included  for start up expenses in connection with the conversion of the banking software solution and costs incurred with the formation of bti financial group 
liquidity liquidity is measured by the bank s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimum loss to the bank 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of its customers  which may come from depositors withdrawing funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet credit needs 
without adequate liquidity management  the bank would not be able to meet the needs of the individuals and communities it serves 
the bank uses a basic surplus deficit model to measure its liquidity over a day and a day time horizon 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement within a day period is examined 
the bank s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of of total assets 
liquidity as measured by the basic surplus deficit model was as of december   for the day horizon and for the day horizon 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates 
the bank s market risk is composed primarily of interest risk  which may cause an unfavorable impact on net interest income 
through the bank s asset liability committee alco  management reviews the interest rate sensitivity position of the bank and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
all guidelines and policies established by alco have been approved by the board of directors 
asset liability management maintains a balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and manages the bank s exposure against adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   bar harbor banking and trust company was liability sensitive with million in assets and million in liabilities that could be repriced within one year 
this increases the exposure of interest rate risk to the bank on these funds in a rising rate environment but could be beneficial in a declining rate environment 
management continues to watch economic trends with respect to interest rates 
the bank uses a simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to interest rates 
the model calculates the impact of changing interest rates for the bank s interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities 
the model assumes a static balance sheet and utilizes a non parallel yield curve shift in rates to recognize the impact of interest rate changes 
based on simulations  if interest rates were to rise by basis points and if the bank were to maintain the balance sheet as it stands today  the bank would reduce its net interest income by  during the next twelve months 
if rates were to drop by basis points  the bank would experience a modest decrease in its net interest income of  during the next twelve months 
the following reflects the bank s net interest income sensitivity analysis as of december   and rate change basis points basis points year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change rate change basis points basis points year net interest income change net interest income change year net interest income change net interest income change the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results may also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  and product preference changes  and other such variables 
the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
when appropriate  alco may use off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps and swaps to hedge its interest rate risk position 
a board of directors approved hedging policy statement governs use of these instruments 
as of december   there were no off balance sheet instruments in place
