item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general in recent years  we made the strategic decision to leverage msc s strength as a low cost  value added mro provider by adding new products and categories of mro supplies  which has increased  and is anticipated to further increase  sales to existing customers and access to new customers 
we believe that revenue has increased  in part  as a result of the increase in the number of skus 
we generally add skus in response to the feedback we receive from our existing customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the number of skus offered or that the correlation between the number of skus offered and revenue will continue 
we significantly expanded our direct mail marketing program from approximately million pieces in fiscal to million pieces in fiscal targeted mailings to customers or potential customers are designed to maximize our return in relation to our marketing expenditures 
we utilize our customer databases to match specific customer profiles with an expanding selection of catalog titles which emphasize specific product categories 
we believe that increasing mailings to more targeted customer segments has resulted in increased marketing productivity 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities by further increasing our direct marketing efforts  however  the costs associated with our direct marketing program will be incurred substantially in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
such costs are expected to be offset  in part  by increases in vendor funded co op payments which will offset a portion of the catalog and mailing expenses 
there can be no assurance that continued expansion of our direct mail marketing program will result in new customers or an increase in sales from existing customers 
we anticipate that our direct sales force expansion initiative will provide value added services to more of our customers  which we believe will increase sales per customer 
the number of annual orders entered and processed has increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  during fiscal the average order size for our core business has increased from approximately in fiscal to approximately during fiscal during  the industrial sector serviced by the company experienced slowing sales to its customers  reflecting general weakness in the economy  and accordingly reduced purchases from its vendors  including the company 
the recent events of september further exacerbated these trends  which the company believes have continued and will continue into fiscal we believe that our targeted marketing campaign strategy  our strategy of continuing to add new product categories and new products within existing categories  and increased efficiencies in order processing have been significant contributing factors to the increase in orders and sales we have received 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow at rates recently experienced or at all 
in fiscal  we used approximately million out of a total of million of cash generated from operations to repay the full amount of approximately million of outstanding borrowings owed to a group of banks under our term loan and credit facilities 
we believe that our business strategies  our cash resources and the reduction of our debt obligations position us to address the opportunities and challenges presented by the current economic climate and trends in the industrial sector 
results of operations the following table summarizes msc s historical results of operations as a percentage of sales for the three most recent fiscal years

the increase in sales to new and certain existing customers offset the fiscal sales decrease from certain other existing customers  which resulted from the progressively slowing industrial sector 
this progressive slowdown has continued into fiscal  and although the company intends to continue to pursue opportunities to increase sales to new customers  there can be no assurance that net sales will continue to increase at rates recently experienced or at all 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased from to

operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased from to 
the increases in operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of net sales were primarily attributable to the costs associated with a significant increase in the company s sales force  increased advertising costs  higher depreciation expense and the inclusion of an extra week in fiscal income from operations decreased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses  offset in part by an increase in net sales and gross profit margin

the remaining net book value of these investments is approximately 
million 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was approximately and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is a direct result of limited tax benefits available from the internet investment write downs  as discussed above 
accordingly  the company s effective tax rate is significantly higher than in prior periods 
excluding the effect of this write down  the effective tax rate is approximately for both periods which is representative of the company s expected tax rate for fiscal year net income decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of the write down of the company s internet investments and a slight decrease in income from operations explained above 
without taking into account the investment write down  net income would have decreased by approximately million  or  to million 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to the company s existing customers and an increase in the number of active customers

operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased from to 
the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to leveraging fixed costs over a larger revenue base

c during fiscal  the company determined that its ability to ultimately recover the value of its investments in four privately held internet startup companies was significantly impaired 
pursuant to the company s evaluation of the respective carrying amounts of each investment  either the entire cost of the investment or a significant portion thereof was charged against earnings during the third quarter of fiscal weeks we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of commencement of operations at new distribution centers 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products  and facilities expansions 
our primary sources of financing have been cash from operations  supplemented by bank borrowings under our credit facility

interest on amounts borrowed may be paid at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate at september  or  alternatively  at the bankers acceptance rate or libor rate plus margins  which vary from per annum based on the ratio of total liabilities to effective net worth  or bid note rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal financial instrument is long term notes payable under a credit agreement
