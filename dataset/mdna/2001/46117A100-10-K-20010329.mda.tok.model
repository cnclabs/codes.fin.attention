item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading provider of data management services to ilecs  clecs and wireless carriers in the united states 
we manage the data that enables a call to be routed to the appropriate public safety agency with accurate and timely information about the caller s identification and location 
we were incorporated in july in the state of colorado under the name systems concepts of colorado  inc and were reincorporated in september in the state of delaware under the name scc communications corp 
prior to  substantially all of our revenue was derived from the sale of software licenses and related implementation services to ilecs and public safety agencies 
during  we began investing in infrastructure to provide our oss solution to telephone operating companies seeking to outsource such operations 
we signed our first data management services contract in august and continue to add to the number of records under management 
we began to recognize revenue from wireless carriers in the third quarter of  and continue to increase the number of live wireless subscribers managed 
in addition  we signed a contract with the general services commission of the state of texas in november  representing the first time that a state agency has endeavored to centralize oss and data management services with a neutral third party 
each of our four business units provides an outsourcing solution for its respective customer bases 
revenue generally includes a non recurring initial fee nre for the design and implementation of the solution  conversion of the customer s data to our systems  hiring and training of personnel  and other costs required to prepare for the processing of customer data 
non recurring fees and the associated costs are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
our contracts also separately allow for a monthly service fee based on the number of subscriber records under management  which is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered 
related costs are expensed as they are incurred 
we may also offer our customers enhanced products or services for which revenue is recognized over the life of the contract 
our revenue breaks down as a percent of total revenue as follows year ended december  revenue percent ilec business unit    clec business unit    wireless business unit    direct business unit  during  we changed our revenue recognition policies to comply with sab specifically  sab requires that we defer the up front nre fee  certain enhancement fees and related incremental costs and recognize them over the lives of our contracts 
the adoption of sab required us to reflect a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as if sab had been implemented on january  and to restate all of our reported quarterly results 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately and  respectively  of total revenue from ameritech  bellsouth inc and qwest  each of which accounted for greater than of our total revenue in such periods 
historically  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from sales to customers in the united states 
however  we have generated revenue in canada and intend to enter additional international markets  which may require significant management attention and financial resources 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future net income for us federal income tax purposes 
since we expect to incur losses in the near term related to development costs for new commercial products  future taxable income may not be sufficient to realize additional deferred tax assets that may be created by the projected net operating losses 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past 
the variation in operating results may likely continue and may intensify 
we believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the length of the sales cycles for new or existing customers  the size  timing or duration of significant customer contracts  fluctuations in number of subscriber records under management  timing or duration of service offerings  rate of adoption of wireless services by psaps  efforts expended to accelerate the introduction of certain new products  our ability to hire  train and retain qualified personnel  increased competition  changes in operating expenses  changes in our strategy  the financial performance of our customers  changes in telecommunications legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our services  and general economic factors 
our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations regarding future revenue 
our revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our services is evolving rapidly and the length of our sales cycle and the size and timing of significant customer contracts vary substantially 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected changes in operations 
as of december   we had incurred expenses of approximately million in marketing  legal and research and development to expand our product offerings with our safetynet sm initiative 
we may spend up to an additional million on this initiative in in addition  we hired additional employees in  and expect to continue hiring additional employees during we also began leasing office space in texas in december  from which we are performing some of our operations 
in october  we also leased additional office space in colorado to accommodate our increased personnel 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total company total revenue increased  from million in to million in total direct costs increased  from million in to million in  representing and of total revenue  respectively 
our lack of profitability during was primarily due to operating losses in our direct and wireless business units as well as due to our significant investment in our safetynet sm initiative 
the net impact of the sab adjustments on revenue and direct costs was a net decrease of approximately  we expect that operating profitability may be attainable by the fourth quarter of ilec business unit ilec revenue increased  from million in to million in due to an increase in the number of records under management and from the sale of enhancements to our existing customer base

the dollar increase in clec costs was due to the hiring of additional clec operations staff to assist with the continued growth in records under management

the net impact of the sab adjustments on clec revenue and direct costs was a net decrease of approximately  clec sales and marketing expenses increased  from  in to  in  representing and of clec revenue for such periods  respectively

we expect clec costs may increase in at a faster rate than revenues but the margins should stabilize by the end of the year

wireless direct costs increased  from million in to million in  due to the hiring of additional systems operations staff and increased systems maintenance and telephone line costs to accommodate growth

direct costs may be significantly greater in than the increase in revenue in the first half of the year  however  we expect that the business unit may generate positive operating income in the final quarter of at december   approximately of our subscribers under contract were live 
we expect that we will have approximately of our subscribers under contract live by december  direct business unit direct revenue increased from  in to million in direct revenue increased due to the transition of records in the state of texas beginning in and delivery of the emergency warning and evacuation sm ewe sm product offering 
the direct business unit continued to successfully execute its strategic plan  increasing the subscriber base in texas to million in the ewe sm subscriber base was  as of year end and million as of february  direct costs increased from million in to million in costs increased due to the opening of our texas office  hiring of additional personnel and development of system infrastructure necessary to implement the state of texas contract and to manage records that have been transitioned

corporate general and administrative expenses increased due to the addition of corporate legal personnel and outside legal fees to address legislative and regulatory issues  the hiring of additional human resources and finance staff to accommodate headcount growth in  including growth related to safetynet sm  and corporate consulting costs 
corporate sales and marketing expenses increased  from million in to million in  representing and in total revenue for such periods  respectively 
corporate sales and marketing expenses increased due to national tradeshow costs  direct marketing related to safetynet sm  and public relations charges

corporate research and development of million in represented labor and associated travel and consulting costs related to the network architecture of the safetynet sm product offering 
we expect our corporate general and administrative expenses and corporate sales and marketing costs in may remain at or close to our current levels 
we also expect that our safetynet sm research and development costs may be consistent with or below our expenses 
our corporate expenses may increase but may be a smaller percentage of revenue in net other income increased  from  in to  in other income increased due to interest income earned from investments and the reduction in interest expense related to the repayment of certain capital leases 
the benefit for income taxes decreased from  in to zero in we expect to incur losses in the near term in order to finance new commercial products

the loss from operations of discontinued division  net of tax of  represents the costs related to the final closeout of unassigned contracts related to our premise products division  which was sold in  and the transition of customer to the company that acquired this division 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception we have funded our operations with cash provided by operations  supplemented by equity and debt financing and leases on capital equipment 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
we expect our operating cash flows to be negative during the first half of but we expect them to turn positive in the second half of due to increased subscriber counts as a result of our wireless deployment efforts 
we borrowed approximately million under our capital lease line secured by capital equipment in  and repaid million and million of capital lease obligations during and  respectively 
additionally  we used million and million in and  respectively  for the purchase of capital assets and software development 
this significant increase was due to capital expenditures related to our safetynet sm initiative as well as due to capital needs created by our significant increase in headcount during we anticipate that our level of spending for capital expenditures may be slightly less in we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  however  we may purchase additional systems in an effort to attain incremental operating efficiencies  especially in our ilec and clec business units and to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our proposed acquisition of lucent public safety systems 
we have a line of credit with a bank equal to million  which is available to meet operating needs 
the interest rate on amounts borrowed under the line of credit is equal to the bank s prime rate or the one  two or three month libor rate plus per annum 
the line of credit matures april  and is collateralized by certain assets 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
we are currently negotiating the renewal of this line of credit 
we also have a million capital lease line with a bank  which is available to meet capital acquisition needs that arise from normal business operations 
the interest rate is equal to the bank s cost of funds at the time of each lease 
separate lease schedules are signed from time to time 
each lease schedule is collateralized by the assets that are being leased 
each lease has its own termination date  typically months 
as of december   the entire million available under the capital lease line had been utilized 
during the year ended december   we incurred research  development and marketing expenses of approximately million on our safetynet sm initiative 
we may spend up to an additional million in our primary focus will be in our wireless business unit 
we plan to accelerate our wireless deployments and development of our coordinate routing database crdb 
we may continue the safetynet sm initiative over the next several years as long as we find the customer demand meaningful enough to make the investment worthwhile 
although we believe that our current cash and investments  cash generated from operations and lease financing will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital needs  research and development initiative and capital expenditures for our core operations  we may seek to raise additional capital to fund our safetynet sm product initiative 
we may seek a new capital lease line or other sources of debt or equity financing to fund this initiative 
in the event our plans or assumptions for our core operations change or prove to be inaccurate  or if we consummate any unplanned acquisitions of businesses or assets  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital  which may include public and private equity and debt financings  sales of nonstrategic assets and other financing arrangements 
in october  we entered into an agreement to acquire specified assets and assume specified liabilities associated with the business of lucent public safety systems  an internal venture of lucent technologies inc delays in closing the transaction have necessitated the renegotiation of several deal terms 
although we have not reached agreement on these revised terms  we are negotiating in good faith to attain that goal 
however  there is a possibility that the transaction may not be completed 
if we reach an agreement to acquire lucent public safety systems  it may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate  especially in the near term 
regardless  we must pay cash for the legal  accounting and other transactions costs associated with the negotiation of the acquisition 
as of december   we had deferred approximately million of transaction related costs on our balance sheet 
if the transaction closes  these costs will form a part of the purchase price 
if we do not complete the acquisition  these costs will be expensed 
we expect to incur additional transaction costs in in an attempt to complete the acquisition
