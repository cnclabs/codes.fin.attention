in addition  further sales force reductions were made at voicecom in  as voicecom exited the small office home office direct sales channel 
significant reductions in direct advertising costs associated with orchestrate also contributed to the decrease at voicecom 
the decrease within the retail calling card operating segment is primarily attributable to the discontinuance of efforts to acquire new customers

revenue declines in the xpedite and voicecom segments partially offset the improvement in general and administrative costs as a percent of revenue 
the significant increase in general and administrative costs excluding one time events in as a percent of revenue from to was primarily driven by significant revenue reductions in the voicecom and retail calling card segments as outlined in the revenue section of this discussion and the continued build out of the company s corporate infrastructure in late and early both of these factors combined to outweigh gains made from the administrative reductions realized as part of the restructuring plans of the voice tel and voicecom systems acquisitions

voicecom depreciation costs were  and of segment revenues in  and  respectively

retail calling card depreciation costs were  and of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in expense as a percent of revenues from to is attributable primarily to the shortening of the useful life of telecommunications equipment from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of to months 
the useful life of this substantial amount of equipment was related to management s decision to cease actively acquiring customers in this operating segment and eventually to sell its customer base 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues from to is attributable to significant declines in the revenues base as outlined in the revenues section of this discussion  and management s decision in the fourth quarter of to reduce the remaining useful lives of certain equipment from two to five years to twelve to fifteen months  as a result of management s decision in the third quarter of to cease acquiring new customers in this segment and exit this business 

corporate depreciation costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively

see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and legal proceedings under item of part i of this document 
acquired research and development costs acquired research and development costs of million expensed in were associated with the acquisition of xpedite 
this cost represents the value assigned to research and development projects in the developmental stage  which had not reached technological feasibility at the date of the acquisition

see note acquisitions in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
asset impairment investments the company continually evaluates the carrying value of its ownership interests in investments in the ptekventures portfolio that are accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and current market conditions 
the business plan objectives the company considers include  among others  those related to financial performance such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature such as the launching of technology or the hiring of key employees 
the company s portfolio companies operate in industries that are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
recently  many internet based businesses have experienced difficulty in raising additional capital necessary to fund operating losses and make continued investments that their management teams believe are necessary to sustain operations 
valuations of public companies operating in the internet sector declined significantly during the company s accounting estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of its carrying basis including goodwill in portfolio companies could change in the near term and the effect of such changes on the financial statements could be material 
while the company currently believes that the recorded amount of carrying basis including goodwill as of december  is not impaired  there can be no assurance that future results will confirm this assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain of these investments were impaired and that the impairment was not temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under asset impairment investments

xpedite adjusted ebitda was or of segment revenues  million or of segment revenues  and million or of segment revenues in   and  respectively 
the decrease in adjusted ebitda from to was primarily due to the strength of the us dollar relative to other global currencies  increased pricing pressure in the market for certain of xpedite s legacy fax services  and increased investment in sales and marketing efforts associated with the launch of new service offerings 
additionally  pricing for certain of xpedite s products real time fax in particular in the asia pacific region deteriorated dramatically in compared to  contributing to the adjusted ebitda decline 
these pricing reductions were directly related to the deregulation of telecommunications services in that region 
xpedite began the exit from the real time fax and telex business in certain asian markets during the fourth quarter of the increase in adjusted ebitda to million in was related to twelve months of operating results for xpedite versus ten months in the decline as a percent of revenue was primarily driven by lower adjusted ebitda acquisitions made in europe in the latter half of and the first half of  along with start up costs associated with the acquisition of a customer list in the asia pacific region of this business unit

premiere conferencing adjusted ebitda was million or of segment revenues  million or of segment revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in adjusted ebitda in was primarily driven by growth in automated conferencing services  readyconference  which carry higher margins than fully attended conferencing services 
the increase in adjusted ebitda in was primarily driven from twelve months of operations for ats versus nine months of operations in the decline in adjusted ebitda as a percent of revenue in is due to start up costs associated with sales and marketing efforts in growing the segment s unattended conferencing product offering 

retail calling card adjusted ebitda was million or of segment revenues  million or of revenues and million or of segment revenues in  and  respectively 
the trend to positive adjusted ebitda in is attributable mainly to all of the initiatives mentioned below that improved adjusted ebitda between the years and the decrease in negative adjusted ebitda in is attributable the exiting of unprofitable prepaid calling card programs in the third quarter of  management s decision in the first quarter of to discontinue its unprofitable direct response advertising in in flight magazines for its premiere worldlink calling card and management s decision in to discontinue unprofitable direct response advertising of its premiere worldlink calling card program with its co branding partners

com  inc subsidiary  stay bonuses earned in connection with the post merger period of the xpedite acquisition and asset impairment and other costs

general and administrative costs related to managing the ptekventures investment portfolio reduced the improvement in adjusted ebidta from to by million 
the ptekventures investment portfolio generated gains from sales of marketable securities of million and million  in and  respectively  which are not included in adjusted ebitda 
the increase in negative adjusted ebitda at the corporate level in versus was primarily driven by the build out of a corporate infrastructure in the latter half of and the first half of effective income tax rate in  and  the company s effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate  primarily as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization associated with the company s acquisitions in and  which have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

offsetting the increases to cash flow were tax payments of million and an increase in accounts receivable 
the payment of approximately million in income taxes is associated primarily with the gain on the sale of webmd and s shares in and the sale of these investments utilized substantially all of the company s domestic net operating loss carryforwards  causing the company to be subject to income taxes for the fiscal years ended december  and under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  taxes paid must be presented in the cash flows from operating activities regardless of their sources 
the company anticipates future tax liabilities on subsequent gains from the sale of its marketable securities

it is anticipated that cash flow needed to support ptekventures investing activities will be significantly lower in than in at december   approximately million of cash and equivalents resided outside of the united states compared to million at december  the company routinely repatriates cash in excess of operating needs in certain countries where the cost to repatriate does not exceed the economic benefits 
intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries generally are considered by management to be permanently invested for the foreseeable future 
therefore  all foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account on the balance sheet 
based on potential cash positions of ptek and potential conditions in the capital markets  management could require repayment of these loans despite the long term intention to hold them as permanent investments 
foreign exchange gains or losses on intercompany loans deemed temporary in nature are recorded in the determination of net income 
management regularly reviews the company s capital structure and evaluates potential alternatives in light of current conditions in the capital markets 
depending upon conditions in these markets  the cash flows from the operating segments and other factors  the company may engage in other capital transactions 
these capital transactions include but are not limited to debt or equity issuances or credit facilities with banking institutions 
restructuring  merger costs and other special charges reorganization of company into ees and ces business segments in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million to reorganize the company into two business segments that focus on specific groups of customers 
these segments were named emerging enterprise solutions and corporate enterprise solutions 
ees focused on small office home office and multi level marketing organizations  and ces focused on large corporate accounts 
this charge was comprised of million of severance costs  million of asset impairment charges  million of contractual obligation costs and million of other costs  primarily to exit facilities and certain activities 
as part of this reorganization  the company identified employees for termination 
these employees included administrative personnel from the company s cleveland headquarters for the previous voice tel and voicecom systems entities  personnel from customer service centers from eight locations and executive management from the acquired companies that were not part of previous restructuring plans 
as of december   all employees were terminated 
the balance at december  represents the remaining severance reserve for former executive management 
in the twelve month period ended december   cash severance payments made to eight former executives was million 
the company expects to pay the remaining severance reserve balance of million to one former executive over the next thirteen months 
the asset impairment charges of million related to certain switching equipment associated with the company s enhanced calling services 
this switching equipment was determined to be no longer operational due to the reduced volume of business associated with the enhanced calling services product 
these two switches were purchased by the company in the second quarter of but were never placed into service 
they remained idle due to the bankruptcy of two license customers that had significant volumes of business with the company 
during the third quarter of management looked for alternative uses for this equipment including the use in potential prepaid calling card business and international calling card programs 
during the fourth quarter of  management reorganized the company into two business units  ces and ees 
the new management of these units decided at that time that forecasted volume for the type of business used for these switches over the switches useful lives would not justify the additional capacity that these switches brought to the company s network 
either potential buyers would be sought or the switches would be used for spare parts on like switches in the company s network 
therefore the company charged a valuation reserve in the fourth quarter of to reduce the asset carrying value to its estimated scrap value 
the company sold these two switches for scrap value during no additional losses were incurred 
the charge taken for contractual obligations for million was associated with management s plan to exit the voice tel corporate headquarters and a certain xpedite operational site 
the charge of million in other costs included increased estimates of exit costs associated with management s revised plan to terminate approximately managers associated with previous acquisitions  the exit of the voice tel corporate headquarters and the exit of various voice tel regional administrative functions 
the reversals in for contractual obligations and other costs resulted from the fact that management s original estimate exceeded the actual payments

the million charge is comprised of million of severance and exit costs  million of lease termination costs and million of facility exit costs 
severance benefits provided for the termination of employees  primarily related to corporate administrative functions  direct sales force and operation of under performing operating segments in the former ees and ces groups 
of the severed employees  were from the voicecom operating segment  from the xpedite operating segment and from corporate headquarters 
the reduction made to the voicecom and xpedite operating segments allowed for the transfer to those segments of approximately employees who had performed centralized administrative functions at corporate 
as of december   all employees were terminated 
annual savings of approximately million were realized from these terminations 
the balance at december  for severance and exit costs represents the remaining reserve for future cash severance and exit payments to former corporate executive management and various management in the former ces group that were terminated in these remaining cash payments were disbursed during the first nine months of during  cash severance payments totaled million 
in the third quarter of  the company recognized as income million of accrued severance and exit payments upon completion of the severance program associated with the decentralization of the company 
this amount represents actual exit costs that were below planned exit costs  relating to the decentralization plan for the european and asia pacific regions of the company s xpedite operating segment

lease termination costs are cash outlays 
the company incurred million in costs in in terminating this lease 
other costs were attributable to site clean up and exit team travel costs to exit one facility in the xpedite segment 
the company incurred million of costs that were cash outlays in the fourth quarter of to close this facility 
in the first quarter of  the company paid  in lease termination and exit costs 
as the decentralization plan of the company was completed and no further payments are expected by management  the remaining balance of the reserve totaling million was reversed in the third quarter of exit of asia real time fax and telex business during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million for costs associated with xpedite s decision to exit its legacy real time fax and telex business in asia 
this service depended on significant price disparities between regulated incumbent telecommunications carriers and xpedite s cost of delivery over its fixed cost network 
with the deregulation of most asian telecommunications markets  xpedite s cost advantage dissipated  and the company decided to exit this service and concentrate on higher value added services such as transactional messaging and messagereach

factors affecting future performance you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below before investing in ptek 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could develop 
other risks and uncertainties that we have not predicted or evaluated could also affect our company 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed  and the trading price of our common stock could decline  resulting in the loss of all or part of your investment 
risks related to our industry the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors  which may make it difficult to maintain or increase our market share and revenue 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  more robust product offerings  more comprehensive support organizations  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  and they may also be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
we believe that our current competitors are likely to expand their product and service offerings and that new competitors are likely to enter our markets 
existing and new competitors may attempt to integrate their products and services  resulting in greater competition 
increased competition could result in price pressure on our products and services and a decrease in our market share in the various markets in which we compete  either of which could hinder our ability to grow our revenue 
the development of alternatives to our products and services may cause us to lose customers and market share  and may hinder our ability to maintain or grow our revenue 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
we expect new products and services  and enhancements to existing products and services  to be developed and introduced that will compete with our products and services 
technological advances may result in the development and commercial availability of alternatives to our products and services or new methods of delivering our products and services 
companies may develop and offer product features  service offerings or pricing options which are more attractive to customers than those currently offered by us 
these new products or services  or methods of delivering these products or services could  among other things 
cause our existing products and services to become obsolete  
be more cost effective  which could result in significant pricing pressure on our products and services  or 
allow our existing and potential customers to meet their own telecommunications needs without using our services 
technological changes that make our products obsolete  or changes in technology that allow competitors to offer products and services that replace our existing products and services could cause us to lose customers  market share and revenue 
if new products and services that we develop and introduce are not accepted in the marketplace  we may lose market share and our revenue may decrease 
we must continually introduce new products and services in response to technological changes  evolving industry standards and customer demands for enhancements to our existing products and services 
we will not be able to increase our revenue if we are unable to develop new products and services  or if we experience delays in the introduction of new products and services  or if our new products and services do not achieve market acceptance 
our ability to successfully develop and market new products and services and enhancements that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or customer demands  is dependent on our ability to 
anticipate changes in industry standards  
anticipate and apply advances in technologies  
enhance our software  applications  equipment  systems and networks  
attract and retain qualified and creative technical personnel  
develop effective marketing  pricing and distribution strategies for new products and services  or 
avoid difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and services or enhancements 
we are subject to pricing pressures for our products and services  which could cause us to lose market share and revenue 
we compete for consumers based on price 
a decrease in the rates charged for communications services by our competitors could cause us to reduce the rates we charge for our products and services 
if we cannot compete based on price  we may lose market share 
if we reduce our rates without increasing our margins or our market share  our revenue could decrease 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could be disruptive to our licensing and strategic relationships 
the telecommunications industry has experienced  and we believe it will continue to experience  consolidation 
consolidation in the telecommunications industry  including consolidations involving our customers  competitors  strategic partners and licensing partners  could lead to pricing pressure on our products and services and could be disruptive to our licensing and strategic relationships 
risks related to our company our future success depends on market acceptance of our new products and services  which includes orchestrate  messagereach and readyconference 
market acceptance of our new products and services often requires that individuals and enterprises accept new ways of communicating and exchanging information 
a decline in the demand for  or the failure to achieve broad market acceptance of  our new products and services could hinder our ability to maintain and increase our revenue 
we believe that broad market acceptance of our new products and services will depend on several factors  including 
ease of use  
price  
reliability  
access and quality of service  
system security  
product functionality  and 
the effectiveness of strategic marketing and distribution relationships 
if we do not met these challenges  our new products and services may not achieve broad market acceptance or market acceptance may not occur quickly enough to justify our investment in these products and services 
concerns regarding security of transactions and transmitting confidential information over the internet may have an adverse impact on the market acceptance of our web enabled products and services  including orchestrate 
the concern regarding the security of confidential information transmitted over the internet may prevent many potential customers from using internet related products and services 
if our web enabled services  such as orchestrate and messagereach  do not include sufficient security features  our web enabled products and services may not gain market acceptance  or there may be additional legal exposure 
despite the measures we have taken  our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person circumvents our security measures  he or she could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruption in our operations 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may be required to make significant investments in efforts to protect against a remedy of these types of security breaches 
additionally  as electronic commerce becomes more widespread  our customers will become more concerned about security 
if we are unable to adequately address these concerns  we may be unable to sell our web enabled products and services 
if our quarterly results do not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price may decrease 
quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast because the market for our services is rapidly evolving 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations as to future revenue 
if revenue levels are below expectations  we may be unable or unwilling to reduce expenses proportionately and operating results would likely be adversely affected 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the risk factors listed herein  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
specific factors that may cause our future operating results to vary include 
the unique nature of strategic relationships into which we may enter in the future  
changes in operating expenses resulting from our strategic relationships and other factors  
the financial performance of our strategic partners  
the performance of strategic equity investments  
the reliability and performance of our products and services  
the timing of new product and service announcements  
market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services  including orchestrate  
the success or failure of past or potential future acquisitions  
changes in legislation and regulations that may affect the competitive environment for our products and services  and 
general economic and seasonal factors 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers and our customers may not transact business with us in the future 
we expect that the information and telecommunications services markets will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies  possibly including alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost effective than our technologies 
we do not typically have long term contractual agreements with our customers  and our customers may not continue to transact business with us in the future if  among other things  any of the following occur 
our products and services become obsolete  
competitors develop products and services that are more sophisticated  efficient or cost effective  or 
technological advances allow our customers to satisfy their own telecommunications needs 
we rely on amway corporation for significant revenue and any loss of business from amway may hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
we have historically relied on sales through amway corporation for a substantial portion of our revenue 
sales to amway accounted for approximately of our revenue in  in  in  in and in although total revenue from amway has decreased significantly  amway remains a significant customer 
our relationship with amway and its distributors may not continue at historical levels  and there is no long term price protection for services provided to amway 
continued loss in total revenue from amway or diminution in the amway relationship  or a decrease in average sales price without an offsetting increase in volume  could hurt our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
if we do not attract and retain highly qualified and creative technical and support personnel we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
we believe that to be successful we must hire and retain highly qualified and creative engineering  product development and customer support personnel 
competition in the recruitment of highly qualified and creative personnel in the information and telecommunications services industry is intense 
we have in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled technical employees with appropriate qualifications 
we may not be able to retain our key technical employees and we may not be able to attract qualified personnel in the future 
if we are not able to locate  hire and retain qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our business may suffer if we do not retain the services of our chief executive officer 
we believe that our continued success will depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of boland t 
jones  our chairman and chief executive officer 
the familiarity of mr 
jones with the markets in which we compete and emerging technologies  such as the internet  makes him especially critical to our success 
we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
jones in the amount of million 
downtime in our network infrastructure could result in the loss of significant customers 
we currently maintain facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls and computer telephony equipment in approximately locations throughout the world 
the delivery of our products and services is dependent  in part  upon our ability to protect the equipment and data at our facilities with telecommunications equipment that routes telephone calls against damage that may be caused by fire  power loss  technical failures  unauthorized intrusion  natural disasters  sabotage and other similar events 
despite taking a variety of precautions  we have experienced downtime in our networks from time to time and we may experience downtime in the future 
these types of service interruptions could result in the loss of significant customers  which could cause us to lose revenue 
we take substantial precautions to protect ourselves and our customers from events that could interrupt delivery of our services 
these precautions include physical security systems  uninterruptible power supplies  on site power generators  upgraded backup hardware  fire protection systems and other contingency plans 
in addition  some of our networks are designed so that the data on each network server is duplicated on a separate network server 
we also maintain business interruption insurance providing for aggregate coverage of approximately million per policy year 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance in the future  it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices  and it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
if we fail to predict growth in our network usage and add needed capacity  then the quality of our service offerings may suffer 
as network usage grows  we will need to add capacity to our hardware and software  our facilities with telecommunications equipment that route telephone calls and our private frame relay network 
this means that we continuously attempt to predict growth in our network usage and add capacity accordingly 
if we do not accurately predict and efficiently manage growth in our network usage  the quality of our service offerings may suffer and we may lose customers 
software failures or errors may result in failure of our platforms and or networks  which could result in increased costs and lead to interruptions in our services and losses of significant customers and revenue 
the software that we have developed and utilized in providing our products and services  including the orchestrate software  may contain undetected errors 
although we generally engage in extensive testing of our software prior to introducing the software onto any of our networks and or product equipment  errors may be found in the software after the software goes into use 
any of these errors may result in partial or total failure of our networks  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete a development project  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our networks or the cancellation of services by significant customers 
we maintain technology errors and omissions insurance coverage of million per policy aggregate 
however  we may not be able to maintain this insurance or it may not continue to be available at reasonable prices 
even if we maintain this insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses we experience due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
interruption in long distance telecommunications services could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
our ability to maintain and expand our business depends  in part  on our ability to continue to obtain telecommunication services on favorable terms from long distance carriers 
we do not own a transmission network 
as a result  we depend on worldcom  global crossing and other long distance carriers for transmission of our customers long distance calls 
these long distance telecommunications services generally are procured under supply agreements with multiyear terms  some of which are subject to various early termination penalties and minimum purchase requirements 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of long distance service  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
the partial or total loss of our ability to receive or terminate telephone calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we depend on local phone companies that provide local transmission services  known as local exchange carriers  as well as companies that purchase and resell local transmission services  known as competitive local exchange carriers  for call origination and termination 
the partial or total loss of the ability to receive or terminate calls could result in service interruptions and a loss of significant customers and revenue 
we have not experienced significant losses in the past due to interruptions of service at terminating carriers  but we might experience these types of losses in the future 
if we have to relocate our equipment or change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our services and increased costs  which could cause us to lose customers 
we lease capacity on the worldcom communications network to provide network connections and data transmission within our private frame relay network 
our telecommunications agreement with worldcom expires on december  we have equipment co located at various worldcom sites under co location agreements that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
our ability to maintain network connections is dependent upon our access to transmission facilities provided by worldcom or an alternative provider 
we may not be able to continue our relationship with worldcom beyond the terms of our current agreements and we may not be able to find an alternative provider on terms as favorable as those offered by worldcom or on any other terms 
if we have to relocate our equipment or change our network transmission provider  we could experience interruptions in our service and or increased costs  which could adversely effect our customer relationships and customer retention 
any significant difficulty obtaining equipment could lead to interruption in service and loss of customers and revenue  and technological obsolescence of our equipment could result in substantial capital expenditures 
we do not manufacture equipment used in providing our products and services  and this equipment is currently available from a limited number of sources 
although we have not historically experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining equipment required for our operations and believe that viable alternative suppliers exist  shortages may arise in the future or alternative suppliers may not be available 
our inability to obtain equipment in the future could result in delays or reduced delivery of messages  which could lead to a loss of customers and revenue 
in addition  technological advances may result in the development of new equipment and changing industry standards  which could cause our equipment to become obsolete 
these events could require us to invest significant capital in upgrading or replacing our equipment 
returned transactions or thefts of services could lead to a loss of revenue  and could adversely effect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we do business 
if our internal controls  risk management practices and bad debt reserve practices are not adequate  returned transactions  unauthorized transactions or thefts of services could lead to a loss of revenue  and could adversely effect customer relationships and perceptions of our business in the markets in which we do business 
we use two principal financial payment clearance systems in connection with our enhanced calling services the federal reserve s automated clearing house for electronic fund transfers  and the national credit card systems for electronic credit card settlement 
in our use of these established payment clearance systems  we generally bear credit risks similar to those normally assumed by other users of these systems arising from returned transactions caused by insufficient funds  stop payment orders  closed accounts  frozen accounts  unauthorized use  disputes  theft or fraud 
we could experience material revenue losses due to these types of returned transactions 
from time to time  persons have gained unauthorized access to our network and obtained services without rendering payment to us by unlawfully using the access numbers and personal identification numbers of authorized users 
in addition  in connection with our wholesale prepaid telephone card relationships  we have experienced unauthorized activation of prepaid telephone cards 
we could experience material revenue losses due to unauthorized use of access numbers and personal identification numbers  unauthorized activation of prepaid calling cards  activation of prepaid calling cards in excess of the prepaid amount  or theft of prepaid calling cards 
we attempt to manage these risks through our internal controls and proprietary billing systems 
we attempt to prohibit a single access number and personal identification number from establishing multiple simultaneous connections to our telecommunications equipment  and generally we establish preset spending limits for each subscriber 
we also maintain reserves for these risks 
however  past experience in estimating and establishing reserves and our historical losses are not necessarily accurate indicators of future losses or the adequacy of the reserves we may establish in the future 
our debt could harm our liquidity and our ability to obtain additional financing  and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
in  we incurred million in indebtedness by issuing convertible notes to the public 
we have significant interest payment obligations as result of these convertible notes 
our debt could inhibit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our debt could also harm our liquidity  because a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures and forego potential acquisitions and investments to be able to meet these debt repayment requirements 
an increase in the rate of amortization of goodwill or other intangible assets or future write downs could cause our financial performance to suffer in future periods 
as of december   we had approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets reflected on our financial statements 
we are amortizing the goodwill and other intangibles over a range of periods we believe appropriate for the assets 
if the amortization period for any of these assets is accelerated due to a reevaluation of the useful life of these assets or for any other reason  amortization expense may initially increase on a quarterly basis or require a write down of the goodwill or other intangible assets  which could cause our financial performance to suffer in future quarters 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law may inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and georgia corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our shareholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of ptek by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of ptek because only one third of the board is up for election each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the georgia business corporation code that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 
in addition to considering the effects of any action on us and our shareholders  our articles of incorporation permit our board of directors and the committees and individual members of the board to consider the interests of various constituencies  including employees  customers  suppliers  and creditors  communities in which we maintain offices or operations  and other factors which they deem pertinent  in carrying out and discharging their duties and responsibilities and in determining what is believed to be our best interests 
our rights plan may also inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of shareholders 
in june  our board of directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series c junior participating preferred stock at a price of sixty dollars per one thousandth of a series c preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights may have anti takeover effects because they will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
however  the rights should not interfere with any merger  statutory share exchange or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights may be terminated by the board of directors at any time on or prior to the close of business ten business days after announcement by us that a person has become an acquiring person 
the rights are intended to encourage persons who may seek to acquire control of us to initiate an acquisition through negotiations with the board of directors 
however  the effect of the rights may be to discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a substantial equity position in the equity securities of  or seeking to obtain control of  us 
one of our growth strategies is to make investments and form alliances with early stage companies involved in emerging technologies  and these strategic investments and alliances may not be successful 
part of our growth strategy is to make strategic equity investments in  and form alliances with  companies involved in emerging technologies 
these strategic investments allow us to develop marketing and strategic alliances  which serve as an important vehicle through which we market our own web enabled services  such as orchestrate 
we made investments of approximately million in  million in and million in to acquire initial interests  or increase existing interests  in companies engaged in emerging technologies 
since many of the companies in which we make strategic investments are small  early stage companies  our investments are subject to the significant risks faced by these companies  which could result in the loss of our investment 
we may not have opportunities to acquire equity interests in additional companies  which could impede our growth strategy 
our equity investments  which are typically made through or held by a subsidiary  have significant value on a stand alone basis 
in the future  we may not be able to identify companies that complement our strategy  and even if we identify a company that complements our strategy  we may not be able to acquire an interest in the company 
if we cannot acquire equity interests in attractive companies  our growth strategy may not succeed 
we may not be able to acquire equity interests in attractive companies for many reasons  including 
a failure to agree on the terms of the acquisition  such as the amount or price of our acquired interest  
incompatibility between us and management of the company  
competition with other investors to make equity investments in the same company  
a lack of capital to acquire an interest in the company  and 
the unwillingness of the company to enter into a strategic agreement with us or to provide us with an equity interest 
we may be unable to obtain maximum value for our equity investments 
we have significant positions in several public and private companies 
we may from time to time sell or otherwise monetize all or a portion of these investments to provide working capital or for other business purposes 
for example  in november and december we sold a significant portion of our webmd holdings in open market transactions and used substantially all of the proceeds to repay our revolving credit facility 
if we divest all or part of any equity interest  we may not receive maximum value for our position 
for equity investments in publicly traded stock  we may be unable to sell our interests at then quoted market prices 
furthermore  for those equity interests that are not publicly traded  the realizable value of our interest may ultimately prove to be lower than the carrying value currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the value of our business may fluctuate because the value of some of our equity investments fluctuates 
a portion of our assets includes the equity securities of both publicly traded and non publicly traded companies 
in particular  we own a significant number of shares of common stock of webmd  s and webex  which are publicly traded companies 
the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in these and other companies may fluctuate due to market conditions and other conditions over which we have no control 
fluctuations in the market price and valuations of the securities that we hold in other companies may result in fluctuations of the market price of our common stock and may reduce the amount of working capital we have available 
we may incur significant costs and may be forced to make disadvantageous business decisions to avoid investment company status  and we may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company 
we may incur significant costs and may be forced to make disadvantageous business decisions to avoid investment company status 
for example  we may be forced to forego attractive investment opportunities or we may have to dispose of investments before we might otherwise do so in order to avoid investment company status 
furthermore  we may suffer other adverse consequences if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act of some investments made by us may constitute investment securities under the act 
in some instances  a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding of its total assets  subject to various exclusions 
in other instances  a company may be deemed to be an investment company if more than of its total assets consists of  and more than of its net income after taxes attributable to it over the last four quarters is derived from  ownership interests in companies it does not control  subject to various exclusions 
investment companies are subject to registration under  and compliance with  the act  unless a particular exclusion or safe harbor applies 
if we are deemed to be an investment company and we register as one with the sec  we would become subject to the requirements of the act 
as a consequence  we could be prohibited from engaging in business or issuing our securities in the manner we have in the past 
if we are deemed to be an unlawfully unregistered investment company  we might be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  some of our contracts might be voidable  and a court appointed receiver could take control of us and liquidate our business 
if our strategic relationships are not successful we may not be able to increase our sales and revenue 
a principal element of our strategic plan is the creation and maintenance of strategic relationships that will enable us to offer our products and services to a larger customer base than we could otherwise reach through our direct marketing efforts 
relationships with our strategic partners have not always been successful 
failure of one or more of our strategic partners to successfully develop and sustain a market for our services  or the termination of one or more of our relationships with a strategic partner  could hinder our ability to increase our sales and our revenue 
although we view our strategic relationships as a key factor in our overall business strategy and in the development and commercialization of our products and services  our strategic partners may not view their relationships with us as significant for their own businesses and any one of them could reassess their commitment to us in the future 
the ability of our strategic partners to incorporate our products and services into successful commercial ventures will require us  among other things  to continue to successfully enhance our existing products and services and develop new ones 
our inability to meet the requirements of our strategic partners or to comply with the terms of our strategic partner arrangements could result in our strategic partners failing to market our services  seeking alternative providers of communications and information services or canceling their contracts with us 
financial difficulties of our strategic partners or licensees could adversely impact our earnings 
many of the companies that have chosen to outsource their communications services to us are small or medium sized telecommunications companies that may be unable to withstand the intense competition in the telecommunications industry 
if any of our strategic partners or licensees suffer financial difficulties  it could hurt our financial performance and adversely impact our earnings 
for example  during the second quarter of  a licensing customer and a strategic partner in our voicecom business unit initiated proceedings under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we recorded approximately million of charges in the second quarter of associated with uncollectible accounts receivable  primarily related to these financially distressed customers 
the financial difficulties of these two customers  as well as revenue shortfalls in the voice and data messaging group and other unanticipated costs and one time charges  contributed to an after tax loss for the second quarter of risks related to past acquisitions if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses into our operations  we may not realize sufficient cost savings and economies of scale 
we are continuing to integrate the operations of several businesses acquired in and by attempting to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary costs 
the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses into our operations is critical to our future performance 
if we cannot successfully integrate and consolidate the operations of acquired businesses with our operations on schedule or at all  these acquisitions may not result in sufficient cost savings or economies of scale and operational synergies may not develop 
potential challenges to the successful integration and consolidation of the operations of acquired businesses include 
consolidation of service centers and work forces  
elimination of unnecessary costs  and 
integration and retention of new personnel 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
we are continuing to integrate previously acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems 
we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty integrating incompatible systems of acquired businesses into our networks 
as a result  our integration plans may materially change in the future 
if we cannot successfully integrate technologies  products  services and systems from acquired businesses with ours  we may not generate sufficient revenue and operational synergies may not develop 
challenges to the successful integration of acquired technologies  products  service offerings and systems include  among other things  the following 
localization of our products and services  
integration of technologies  telecommunications equipment and networks  
cross selling of products and services to our customer base and customer bases of acquired businesses  and 
compliance with regulatory requirements 
if we do not properly manage the growth we have experienced through acquisitions  our administrative  technical and financial resources may be strained  which could cause the quality of our products and services to suffer 
we have experienced substantial growth in revenue and personnel in recent years  particularly in and early  a substantial portion of which has been accomplished through our acquisitions of voice tel enterprises  inc and its related entities and franchisees  voicecom systems  inc  xpedite systems  inc and american teleconferencing services ltd 
our growth through acquisitions has placed significant demands on all aspects of our business  including our administrative  technical  and financial personnel and systems 
additional expansion may further strain our administrative  technical  financial  management and other resources 
our systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
if we are unable to do this  then the quality of our services may suffer  which will make it difficult to grow or maintain our market share in the markets in which we compete 
risks related to possible future acquisitions we intend to pursue future acquisitions and we may face risks in acquiring and integrating other businesses  products and technologies 
we intend to pursue future acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that we believe will complement our business 
as a result  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities  frequently engage in acquisition discussions  conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible acquisitions  and  where appropriate  engage in acquisition negotiations 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets 
in addition  we compete for acquisitions and expansion opportunities with companies that have substantially greater resources and competition with these companies for acquisition targets could result in increased prices for possible targets 
acquisitions also involve numerous additional risks to the company and investors  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  
the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  
entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  
potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  
the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  and 
adverse financial impact from the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we fail to assimilate and retain key employees of future businesses we acquire  it could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
assimilation and retention of the key employees of an acquired company are generally important to the success of an acquisition 
if we fail to assimilate and retain any key employees of any business we acquire  the acquisition may not result in revenue growth  operational synergies or product and service enhancements  which could jeopardize the success of the acquisition 
future acquisitions may involve restructuring and other special charges  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
we have taken  and in the future may take  charges in connection with acquisitions  which may cause our financial performance to suffer during the period in which the charge is taken 
in addition  the costs and expenses incurred may exceed the estimates upon which these charges are based 
during the second quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voice tel 
during the third quarter of  we took a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of voicecom systems 
we also recorded restructuring and other special charges before income taxes of approximately million in connection with the acquisition of xpedite 
risks related to intellectual property we may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights  which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs 
we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights and technology  brand and marks 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary rights and technology  we could lose those rights and incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights 
our proprietary rights and technology include confidential information and trade secrets that we attempt to protect through confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions in our licensing  services  reseller and other agreements 
we typically attempt to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through these contractual provisions for the term of the applicable agreement and  to the extent permitted by applicable law  for some negotiated period of time following termination of the agreement  typically one to two years at a minimum 
our means of protecting our intellectual property  proprietary rights and technology may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the us furthermore  some of our systems  such as those used in our document distribution business are not proprietary and  as a result  this information may be acquired or duplicated by existing and potential competitors 
if claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and successfully prosecuted against us  it could result in substantial costs 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information services and telecommunications  computer telephony  the internet and unified messaging  which allows a person to access all of their messaging devices from a computer or telephone 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of our business  we have been and expect to continue to be  subject to third party claims that our current or future products or services infringe the patent  copyright or trademark rights or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
claims alleging patent  copyright or trademark infringement may be brought against us with respect to current or future products or services 
if these types of actions or claims are brought we may not ultimately prevail and any claiming parties may have significantly greater resources than we have to pursue litigation of these types of claims 
any infringements claims  whether with or without merit  could 
be time consuming and a diversion to management  
result in costly litigation  
cause delays in introducing new products and services or enhancements  
result in costly royalty or licensing agreements  or 
cause us to discontinue use of the challenged technology  tradename or service mark at potentially significant expense associated with the marketing of a new name or the development or purchase of replacement technology 
examples of prior and current infringement claims include the following in february  we entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax ip llc settling a patent infringement suit filed by audiofax in june effective april   this initial license agreement was amended to include xpedite within the coverage of the license 
in september  one of our subsidiaries also entered into a long term nonexclusive license agreement with audiofax 
prior to its acquisition by us  xpedite received a letter from cable wireless  inc informing xpedite that cable wireless had received a demand letter from audiofax claiming that some cable wireless products and services infringed audiofax s patent rights 
cable wireless initially sought indemnification from xpedite for this claim 
subsequent to our acquisition of xpedite  cable wireless notified us of the audiofax claim and sought indemnification directly from us 
in  xpedite received an additional letter from cable wireless informing xpedite of the existence of one of their patents and the potential applicability of that patent on xpedite s products and services 
in december  we entered into a settlement agreement with cable wireless settling all disputes over the indemnification claim and potential applicability of their patent to our products and services 
in  we received separate letters from ronald a 
katz technology licensing  lp katz and aerotel limited aerotel usa  inc  and in from nortel networks  inc  informing us of the existence of their respective patents or patent portfolios and the potential applicability of those patents on our products and services 
we are currently considering each of these matters 
however  we currently lack sufficient information to assess the potential outcomes of these matters 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  however  we are unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we were to prevail in this type of challenge  our business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs 
certain of our customers have alleged that we are obligated to indemnify them against patent infringement claims made by katz against such customers 
we do not believe that we have an obligation to indemnify such customers  however  due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we are unable to predict the outcome of any potential litigation  and any adverse outcome could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we were to prevail in this type of challenge  our business could be adversely affected by the diversion of management attention and litigation costs 
in march  aspect telecommunications  inc aspect  the purported owner of certain patents  filed suit against the company and premiere communications  inc pci alleging that they had violated claims in these patents and requesting damages and injuncture relief 
in the fourth quarter of  the company and pci entered into a settlement agreement with aspect  which settled and disposed of aspect s claims in this litigation 
this settlement did not and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to pending litigation our pending litigation could be costly  time consuming and a diversion to management and  if adversely determined  could result in the loss of rights or substantial liabilities for damages 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are subject to a variety of claims and litigation from third parties  including allegations that our products and services infringe the patents  trademarks and copyrights of these third parties 
we have several litigation matters pending  which we are defending vigorously 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the litigation process and the judicial system  we cannot predict the outcome of these litigation matters 
regardless of the outcome  these litigation matters could be costly  time consuming and a diversion of management and other resources 
if the outcome of one or more of these matters is adverse to us  it could result in a loss of material rights or substantial liabilities for damages

risks related to government regulation us or other government regulations and legal uncertainties related to the internet may place financial burdens on our business related to compliance 
currently  there are few laws or regulations directed specifically at electronic commerce and the internet 
however  because of the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws and regulations may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as collection and use of data from web site visitors and related privacy issues  pricing  content  copyrights  on line gambling  distribution and quality of goods and services 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet  which could impede the growth of our web enabled products and services and place additional financial burdens on our business in order to comply with new laws and regulations 
laws and regulations directly applicable to electronic commerce or internet communications are becoming more prevalent 
for example  the united states congress recently enacted laws regarding on line copyright infringement and the protection of information collected on line from children 
although these laws may not have a direct adverse effect on our business  they add to the legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the internet and possible future costs of regulatory compliance 
our failure to comply with various government regulations related to long distance and operator service could impair our ability to deliver our products and services 
premiere communications  inc pci  our operating subsidiary that provides regulated long distance telecommunications and operator services  is subject to regulation by the fcc and by various state public service and public utility commissions  and is affected by regulatory decisions  trends and policies made by these agencies 
various international authorities may also seek to regulate the long distance and operator services provided by pci 
if pci fails to comply with these various government regulations  we could be prohibited from providing these services and we might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
pci uses reasonable efforts to ensure that its operations comply with these regulatory requirements 
however  pci may not be currently in compliance with all fcc and state regulatory requirements 
furthermore  pci s facilities do not prevent its customers from making long distance calls in any state  including states in which it currently is not authorized to provide intrastate telecommunications services and operator services 
premiere communications provision of long distance telecommunications and operator services in states where it is not in compliance with public utility commission requirements could result in prohibitions on providing long distance service and subject us to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for noncompliance 
we may become subject to new laws and regulations involving services and transactions in the areas of electronic commerce  which could increase costs of compliance 
in conducting our business  we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to commercial transactions generally  such as the uniform commercial code  and we are also subject to the electronic funds transfer rules embodied in regulation e promulgated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
congress has held hearings regarding  and various agencies are considering  whether to regulate providers of services and transactions in the electronic commerce market 
it is possible that congress  the states or various government agencies could impose new or additional requirements on the electronic commerce market or entities operating therein 
if enacted  these laws  rules and regulations could be imposed on our business and industry and could result in substantial compliance costs 
risks related to international operations and expansion our future success depends on our expansion into international markets and revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of expansion 
a component of our strategy is our planned expansion into international markets 
revenue from international operations may not grow enough to offset the cost of establishing and expanding these international operations 
we currently deliver multimedia messaging services worldwide 
we also operate voice messaging service centers in canada  australia  new zealand  puerto rico  the united kingdom  italy and taiwan 
in addition  we have conferencing operations in canada  australia  china  singapore  japan  france  germany and the united kingdom 
while we have significant international experience in the delivery of our multimedia messaging services  we have only limited experience in marketing and distributing our conferencing services and unified communications services internationally 
accordingly  we may not be able to successfully market  sell and deliver our conferencing and unified communications services in the new international markets 
there are risks inherent in international operations that could hinder our international growth strategy 
our ability to achieve future success will depend in part on the expansion of our international operations 
there are difficulties and risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could prevent us from selling our products and services in other countries or hinder our expansion once we have established international operations  including  among other things  the following 
burdensome regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in these requirements  
export restrictions and controls relating to technology  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  
longer payment cycles  
problems in collecting accounts receivable  
political and economic instability  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
we could experience losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we conduct business outside the us and some of our expenses and revenue are derived in foreign currencies 
in particular  a significant portion of our multimedia messaging business is conducted outside the us and a significant portion of our revenue and expenses from that business are derived in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we could experience material losses due to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we have not experienced any material losses from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  but we could in the future 
we typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currency and have not regularly engaged in hedging transactions  although we may engage in hedging transactions from time to time in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
derivative instruments are not currently used and  if utilized  are employed as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
at december   no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate convertible subordinated notes outstanding at december   by million 
approximately of the company s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of the company s reported sales and operating income 
a hypothetical positive or negative change of in foreign currency exchange rates would positively or negatively change revenue for by approximately million and operating expenses for by approximately million 
historically  the company s principal exposure has been related to local currency sales  operating costs and expenses in europe and asia principally the united kingdom  germany and japan 
the company has not used derivatives to manage foreign currency exchange risk and no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding at december
