the commitment letter waives the covenant violations 
in addition  the commitment letter establishes revised covenants to reflect the company s projections and consolidation plan

on december  and january   the company refinanced million of existing operating equipment 
as a result of the ccg acquisition in and the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment over the past two years  the company s total indebtedness and future debt service obligations have increased significantly from prior levels

in addition  proceeds from the sale of equipment and a building discussed below will be utilized to pay down borrowings under the company s debt agreements 
subsequent events the company began experiencing weakness in sales during the third and fourth quarters of  which has continued into the first quarter of this is due in part to lower sales of video  entertainment and software packaging products to certain customers  and a general weakness in the economy 
while the company believes the reduction in demand for its products is temporary  it is currently taking aggressive steps to reduce capacity and bring its operations more in line with both current and projected revenue levels 
the company anticipates that its planned consolidation  discussed below  will not compromise the company s ability to achieve growth in the markets that we currently serve 
the investments which have been made in digital workflow have significantly improved turnaround times essentially eliminating the need for a physical presence in indiana 
pursuant to the company s planned consolidation  which was approved by the company s board of directors in march  the company intends to close its indiana location during the second quarter of the company believes that the majority of sales and required manufacturing capacity associated with the indiana location can be absorbed by the company s remaining locations  where there is presently sufficient capacity 
in addition  the company intends to streamline further its operations by selling certain other equipment in an effort to further realign its capacity 
the company believes that this operating realignment will provide a reduced cost structure and improve the company s profit potential 
in connection with these consolidation initiatives  the company has written down the related assets to their net realizable value and recorded a charge of  related to the revaluation of these impaired assets in the fourth quarter of in connection with the consolidation  the company expects to incur certain exit costs  principally severance  estimated at  such amounts will be expensed in a summary of the charges relating to the closing of the indiana facility and expected sale of equipment is presented below write off of goodwill  estimated loss on sale of equipment  total  the goodwill relates to the indiana acquisition in the company has provided for the loss on sale of equipment by using the estimated fair market value less any costs related to the sale based on information received from equipment manufacturers and brokers 
such estimates of the value of equipment could change based on the actual proceeds received by the company 
anticipated proceeds from the sale of equipment will be utilized to pay down borrowings under the company s debt agreements 
the company believes that these initiatives will improve its cost structure and profit margins and strengthen its competitive position in both current and new markets 
by consolidating operations  the company believes that it will achieve improved production efficiency  profitability and asset utilization 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s profit margins and competitive position will improve 
inflation and seasonality the company has experienced certain inflationary increases in variable costs 
the company has continued to manage the impact of these cost increases by renegotiating supplier contracts that provide price protection and price roll backs  as well as obtaining certain volume discounts through the purchase of larger quantities of raw material and improving manufacturing efficiencies  while providing the same high quality product at competitive prices 
historically  a portion of the company s business has been moderately seasonal 
the requirements of the home video  music and cosmetic markets for products to be delivered for the holiday season generally causes an increase in sales from august through october
