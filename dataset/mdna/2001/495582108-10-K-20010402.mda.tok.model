please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview general king continued its record of growth with several milestone events during these events include the acquisitions of medco research  inc and jones pharma incorporated  the fda s approval of new indications for our largest product altace r based on the primary findings of the hope trial and acquisition of a license related to the development and potential commercialization of human papillomavirus hpv vaccine 
medco acquisition on february   we acquired medco research which we later renamed king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc the merger expands our research and development capabilities 
king research and development has successfully developed two currently marketed adenosine based products  adenocard r and adenoscan r  for which we receive royalty revenues 
this adenosine franchise and related patented technologies complement king s key cardiovascular portfolio 
king research and development remains focused on the development of binodisine mre  a myocardial pharmacologic stress imaging agent  and a number of lead pre clinical programs and product life cycle development projects 
jones pharma merger on august   we completed our merger with jones pharma 
the merger provides us with a more diversified portfolio of branded pharmaceutical products and a significantly larger sales force providing potential synergies in the expanded marketing of our products  in particular  altace r and levoxyl r 
also  we believe our improved balance sheet following the merger better positions us for the continued successful execution of our growth strategies 
altace r new indications on october   the fda approved new indications for altace based on the primary findings of the hope trial 
altace r  an ace inhibitor  was first approved by the fda in for use in the treatment of hypertension and subsequently approved by the fda for the treatment of congestive heart failure after a patient suffers a heart attack 
as a result of the fda approval on october   altace r is the only ace inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction  stroke  or death from cardiovascular causes in patients years and older at high risk of developing a major cardiovascular event because of a history of coronary artery disease  stroke  peripheral vascular disease  or diabetes that is accompanied by at least one other cardiovascular risk factor hypertension  elevated total cholesterol levels  low hdl levels  cigarette smoking  or documented microalbuminuria 
in order to enhance the growth potential of altace r as a result of the new indications  we entered into the co promotion agreement for altace with the wyeth ayerst division of american home products in june pursuant to the co promotion agreement  american home products and king have together assigned more than sales representatives to the detailing of altace r 
this greatly expanded combined sales force began promoting altace r during the first week of november acquisition of hpv vaccine and estrasorb tm licenses on december   we acquired an exclusive license from novavax  inc to use its proprietary cell line to develop and potentially commercialize recombinant human papillomavirus hpv virus like particle vlp vaccines 
pursuant to the license agreement  king has an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and market hpv vlp vaccines for the prevention and or treatment of hpv infection  except that novavax retains the right to co market any such product in the united states  including puerto rico 
the national cancer institute will fund the initial planned related phase iii clinical trial which is expected to commence during mid we also acquired an exclusive worldwide license  except in the united states  canada  italy  netherlands  greece  switzerland and spain  from novavax on january  to promote  market  distribute and sell estrasorb tm  novavax s topical  transdermal estrogen replacement therapy in late stage development 
novavax has indicated that it expects to file a new drug application for estrasorb tm in the following summarizes net revenues by operating segment in thousands 
for the years ended december  branded pharmaceuticals    licensed products    contract manufacturing    other    total    results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in  due primarily to the acquisition and growth of branded pharmaceutical products 
net sales from branded pharmaceutical products increased million  or  to million in from million in the acquisitions of nordette r and bicillin r from american home products in july  the acquisition of lorabid r from eli lilly in august  and increases in net sales of altace r  levoxyl r  and thrombin jmi r offset by the discontinuance of fluogen r  which generated million net sales in  accounted for the majority of the net sales increase in branded pharmaceutical products 
while we expect continued growth in net sales of our branded pharmaceuticals going forward  we refer you to the risk factors that appear elsewhere in this report  particularly those related to altace r  levoxyl r and thrombin jmi r  that could cause results to differ 
furthermore  from time to time we announce price increases on some of our pharmaceutical products 
in advance of a price increase  many of our customers may order pharmaceutical products in larger than normal quantities 
we cannot determine the exact quantity of additional inventory that our customers may order in anticipation of a price increase 
the ordering of excess quantities in any quarter could cause sales of some of our branded pharmaceutical products to be lower in the subsequent quarter than they would have been otherwise 
revenue from licensed products is derived from royalty payments we receive based on sales of adenoscan r and adenocard r by our licensees 
revenues from licensed products increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to continued year over year increases in unit sales of adenoscan r by fujisawa  our north american licensee 
fujisawa is the source of substantially all of our royalties 
while we believe revenue from licensed products will continue to grow  we do not expect it to continue at as high a rate as we experienced in revenues from contract manufacturing increased million  or  to million in from million in contract manufacturing revenues increased due to increased contract sales of thrombin products which are expected to decline in due to the termination of a significant contract 
net sales from generic and other sources decreased million  or  to million in from in primarily due to decreased sales of a generic product line 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab which clarifies accounting and reporting standards for revenue recognition 
the new policy recognizes that risks of ownership in some transactions do not substantively transfer to customers until the product has been received by them  without regard to when legal title has transferred

as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses slightly increased to in from in we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase substantially as a percentage of total revenues during in comparison to  primarily due to the co promotion fee we will pay american home products on net sales of altace r pursuant to the co promotion agreement 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of the intangible assets related to the acquisitions of products from american home products in july and lorabid r in august research and development increased million to million in from million in we believe this trend will continue at a slightly accelerated rate during during the year ended december   we incurred merger  restructuring  and other nonrecurring charges of million in relating to the tax free pooling of interests transactions with medco in february and jones in august in addition  we incurred nonrecurring charges of million relating to the discontinuance of the fluogen r product and million relating to the discontinuance of the development of pallacor tm in operating income operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding the special nonrecurring charges described above  operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased revenues from certain branded pharmaceutical products
