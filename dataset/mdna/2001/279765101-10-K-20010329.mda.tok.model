in addition  a portion of our revenues is derived from barter transactions 
barter advertising revenue is a non cash item and relates to advertising placed on our web sites by other internet companies in exchange for our advertising placed on their web sites 
barter advertising revenue is recorded in the month that banners are exchanged 
the amount of barter advertising revenue and expense is recorded at the fair market value of the services received or provided  whichever is more objectively determinable 
other barter revenue is also non cash and relates to corporate contract sales for which we received computer equipment or other non cash consideration for services provided 
the amount of such revenues are recorded at the fair market value of the equipment or services received or services provided  whichever is more objectively determinable
