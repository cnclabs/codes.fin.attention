item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company believes that the most significant measures of its operating performance are funds from operations and ebitda 
funds from operations is defined as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring  sales or write down of assets and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  plus depreciation and amortization excluding depreciation on personal property and amortization of loan and financial instrument costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities 
adjustments for unconsolidated entities are calculated on the same basis 
funds from operations does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ebitda represents earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities  extraordinary items  gain loss on sale of assets  preferred dividends and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
this data is relevant to an understanding of the economics of the shopping center business as it indicates cash flow available from operations to service debt and satisfy certain fixed obligations 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
while the performance of individual centers and the management companies determines ebitda  the company s capital structure also influences funds from operations 
the most important component in determining ebitda and funds from operations is center revenues 
center revenues consist primarily of minimum rents  percentage rents and tenant expense recoveries 
minimum rents will increase to the extent that new leases are signed at market rents that are higher than prior rents 
minimum rents will also fluctuate up or down with changes in the occupancy level 
additionally  to the extent that new leases are signed with more favorable expense recovery terms  expense recoveries will increase 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for the year ended december  also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

the joint venture sold the property for million  including a note receivable from the buyer for million at an interest rate of payable monthly  until its maturity date of september  the properties acquired by sdg macerich properties  lp  pprt and the management companies joint venture acquisitions are reflected using the equity method of accounting 
the results of these acquisitions are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies 
many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the joint venture acquisition centers  the and acquisition centers and the partial sale and contribution of the contributed jv assets to pprt during many factors impact the company s ability to acquire additional properties  including the availability and cost of capital  the overall debt to market capitalization level  interest rates and availability of potential acquisition targets that meet the company s criteria 
there were no acquisitions in because of market conditions  including the cost of capital and the lack of attractive opportunities 
furthermore  management currently anticipates no acquisitions for accordingly  management is uncertain whether in future years that there will be similar acquisitions and corresponding increases in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies and funds from operations that occurred as a result of the joint venture acquisition centers and the and acquisition centers

all other centers  excluding the and acquisition centers  the joint venture acquisition centers  the contributed jv assets and redevelopment centers  are referred to herein as the same centers  unless the context otherwise requires 
revenues include rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents which requires rent to be recognized each year in an amount equal to the average rent over the term of the lease  including fixed rent increases over that period 
the amount of straight lined rents  included in consolidated revenues  recognized in was million compared to million in additionally  the company recognized through equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures  million as its pro rata share of straight lined rents from joint ventures in compared to million in these decreases resulted from the company structuring the majority of its new leases using annual consumer price index cpi increases  which generally do not require straight lining treatment 
the company believes that using cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
the bankruptcy and or closure of an anchor  or its sale to a less desirable retailer  could adversely affect customer traffic in a center and thereby reduce the income generated by that center 
furthermore  the closing of an anchor could  under certain circumstances  allow certain other anchors or other tenants to terminate their leases or cease operating their stores at the center or otherwise adversely affect occupancy at the center 
other retail stores at the centers may also seek the protection of bankruptcy laws and or close stores  which could result in the termination of such tenants and thus cause a reduction in cash flow generated by the centers 
in addition  the company s success in the highly competitive real estate shopping center business depends upon many other factors  including general economic conditions  the ability of tenants to make rent payments  increases or decreases in operating expenses  occupancy levels  changes in demographics  competition from other centers and forms of retailing and the ability to renew leases or relet space upon the expiration or termination of leases

there were million of borrowings outstanding at december  the line of credit has been extended to may at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents available of million 
funds from operations the company believes that the most significant measure of its performance is ffo

included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents that impacted minimum rents was  for   for and  for the decline in straight lining of rents from to is due to the company structuring its new leases using rent increases tied to the change in cpi rather than using contractually fixed rent increases 
cpi increases do not generally require straight lining of rent treatment 
inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on increases in the cpi 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than ten years  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
this reduces the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  plus the change in accounting principle discussed below for percentage rent  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year 
new pronouncements issued in december  the securities and exchange committee issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which became effective for periods beginning after december  this bulletin modified the timing of revenue recognition for percentage rent received from tenants 
this change will defer recognition of a significant amount of percentage rent for the first three calendar quarters into the fourth quarter 
the company applied this change in accounting principle as of january  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle at the adoption date of january   including the pro rata share of joint ventures  was approximately  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas which requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
changes in the fair values of those derivatives will be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which delays the implementation of sfas from january  to january  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas which amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas the company has determined the implementation of sfas and sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  reducing interest rate exposure on certain long term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps with appropriately matching maturities  using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions  and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity
