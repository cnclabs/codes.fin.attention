item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios 
we manage a broad range of domestic and international stock  bond  and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors 
investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under management 
accordingly  fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 
total assets under our management were billion at december   including billion in domestic equity securities and billion in international equity securities 
rowe price fleming international acquisition 
on august   we completed our purchase of robert fleming holdings interest in our consolidated subsidiary  rowe price fleming international  which at that time managed billion 
this purchase transaction resulted in goodwill of million which is being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
coincident with the change in ownership  our subsidiary was renamed t 
rowe price international and our international research contracts with robert fleming affiliates were terminated 
transition services are being provided to us by certain robert fleming affiliates during an interim period in which we are establishing the new operating infrastructure for our international investment operations 
additionally  we are now expanding our marketing efforts to include european investors and may seek other investors on a global basis 
our expenditures in these efforts may be significant and will precede revenues from any new investment advisory clients that we may obtain 
results of operations 
versus net income increased nearly million or to million and diluted earnings per share rose from to 
total revenues increased from billion to a record billion  led by an increase of million in investment advisory fees 
investment advisory revenues earned from the t 
rowe price mutual funds increased million as average fund assets under management were billion during  billion more than in however  declines in financial market valuations pushed fund assets down billion during the year 
net redemptions by fund investors were billion during defined contribution plans moved billion to other advisors on the last day of the year  offsetting net inflows that had occurred until that time 
the merger of a client into another firm and the restructuring of investments by a large state pension plan were the primary causes of the outflows at year end 
other fund asset decreases were the result of our redemption of almost 
billion to partially fund the rowe price fleming acquisition and 
billion of dividends  net of reinvestments  that were paid out during the year 
mutual fund assets ended at billion  including billion in stock funds 
assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage were also higher during most of and contributed million of additional advisory fees 
in addition  performance related advisory fees were million higher in we earn performance fees primarily on venture capital investments that we manage and  though recurring  these fees will vary significantly as market conditions and investment portfolios change 
assets in other portfolios that we manage ended at billion  down from billion at the beginning of the year due primarily to international portfolios which experienced both market depreciation of billion and outflows of billion during administrative fees from advisory related services that we provide to the funds and their shareholders rose million from to million 
this increase is primarily attributable to transfer agency and recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans and the price mutual funds and includes million of b distribution fees received from the new advisor class of mutual fund shares 
administrative revenues are largely offset by the costs that we incur in providing the services  including fees paid to third parties which distribute the advisor shares to their clients 
discount brokerage added million of the increase on greater transaction volume offset by lower average commissions arising from the shift to transactions originating over the internet 
investment and other income rose more than million from to million 
net gains of million on dispositions of our stock and bond mutual fund holdings in versus losses of million recognized on fund holdings in account for million of the increase 
higher returns on our venture capital investments added million in the strong markets of late and early produced significant market gains and distributions from venture capital investments 
income from this source will vary with market conditions and the size of our investments 
larger capital gain distributions resulting from our stock fund holdings added million to our income 
foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from our yen denominated debt account for a positive change of million as the losses experienced in largely reversed in we expect that investment income will generally be lower in future periods 
operating expenses increased to million 
greater compensation and related costs  which were up million or  were attributable to increases in our rates of compensation  including performance related bonuses  and an increase in our staff size primarily to support our growing operations 
as of december   we employed more than  associates 
our advertising and promotion expenditures increased million from the prior year to million 
these costs will vary with market conditions and investor demand for our products as we seek to expand our base both domestically and internationally 
we expect spending in to exceed that of and  in particular  the first quarter of to be slightly higher than the preceding fourth quarter of international investment research fees were down million from as the contract for these services terminated at the time of the rowe price fleming acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expense was million higher in due primarily to the expansion of our operating facilities in owings mills in late and early amortization of goodwill arising from the rowe price fleming purchase and interest expense on our acquisition indebtedness added million and million  respectively  to our expenses 
under current accounting principles  goodwill charges of million per quarter will recur in the future 
other operating expenses increased million largely due to significant broad based technology expenditures that support established and new business activities 
additional expenses in connection with our international expansion also contributed to the higher expense levels 
costs incurred for defined contribution plan recordkeeping systems and the distribution of the advisor class of fund shares also increased our expense levels  however  these charges were generally offset by additional administrative revenues 
we anticipate that our operating expenses in at least the first half of will continue to be higher in comparison to prior comparable periods  but that the amount of increase will moderate from that experienced in the second half of the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher than that of largely due to the new goodwill charges that are not deductible in determining our income tax expense 
the effective tax rate will rise again in as we recognize a full year s amortization of goodwill 
minority interests declined million due to the acquisition of robert fleming s interest in rowe price fleming 
versus net income increased million or to million  or diluted earnings per share of  from million or diluted earnings per share of

net cash inflows to the funds during the year totaled billion  including inflows of more than billion into domestic stock and blended funds  offset in part by billion of outflows from international stock funds and 
billion from bond and money market funds 
domestic growth stock funds accounted for the largest net inflows with the science technology and blue chip growth funds each drawing more than billion 
greater assets in other investment portfolios  including variable annuity and other subadvised funds  and an increase of million in performance based fees contributed the balance of advisory revenue gains totaling million 
assets under management in other investment portfolios were billion at december   up billion during administrative fees from advisory related services to the funds and their shareholders rose million from to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to defined contribution retirement plan recordkeeping services  however  increased operating expenses offset these gains

operating expenses increased to nearly million 
greater compensation and related costs  which were up million or  were attributable to increases in rates of compensation  including performance related bonuses  and an increase in staff size of primarily to support the growing investment related administrative services and technology based operations

the crossover of operations into was made successfully 
expenditures for the comprehensive efforts involved totaled million through year end  including more than million in  an increase of about million from the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower than that of due to changes in income apportionment for purposes of state taxation 
capital resources and liquidity 
we financed the rowe price fleming acquisition from available cash holdings of million and borrowings of million from the five year  million syndicated bank credit facility that we obtained in june we have also obtained a complementary million  day syndicated bank credit facility 
we reduced outstanding borrowings million in november and expect that available cash resources will be used to further reduce borrowings in during the three years ended december   stockholders equity more than doubled  increasing from million to million 
stockholders equity at december  includes million of unrealized security holding gains after provision for income taxes on investments and million which is restricted as to use under various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we invest in our sponsored mutual funds  which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading  we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments 
mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk  that is  the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares 
each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices  credit ratings  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates 
the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares 
this potential future loss of value reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund s lowest fair value per share during the prior twelve months 
in considering this presentation  it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day  it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted  and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 
fair value at potential december  of lower of potential loss portfolio value portfolio of value stock funds domestic    international    total    blended funds   bond funds   potential loss before income taxes attributable to accumulated comprehensive income  the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year s annual report was million on sponsored mutual fund investments of million at the end of during  we incurred net unrealized losses of million in the value of our mutual fund investments 
we last recognized a net loss in the value of our fund holdings in investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds  by their nature  invest in a number of different financial instruments 
t 
rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds 
in addition  investment holdings may be altered from time to time  in response to changes in market risks and other factors  as deemed appropriate by management 
in evaluating market risk  it is also important to consider the risk that the value of managed investment portfolios will decline 
because revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under management  declines of financial market values will negatively impact revenues and net income 
the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen in  and an exchange rate gain was recognized on the yen borrowing that reversed much of the loss recognized in in evaluating exchange rate sensitivity  a loss of nearly million would be recognized if the yen strengthened from december  other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not material
