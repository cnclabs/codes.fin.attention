item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
you should read the cautionary statements made in this report as applying to related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results may be materially different from the results we discuss in the forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed in risk factors and other sections of this report 
overview we provide point of care medication management and physician decision support solutions that focus on addressing the needs of physicians  managed care payers and plans 
from our inception in through  we focused almost exclusively on the sale of prepackaged medications to physicians  in particular those with a high percentage of fee for service patients 
the advent of managed prescription benefit programs required providers to obtain reimbursement for medications dispensed from managed care organizations rather than directly from their patients 
this new reimbursement methodology made it more difficult for our physician customers to dispense medications to their patient base 
in  under the direction of our new executive management team  we focused our efforts on the information aspects of medication management  including the development of technology tools necessary for electronic prescribing  routing of prescription information and submission of medication claims for managed care reimbursement 
in january  we introduced the first version of touchscript that fully incorporated these features 
at the same time  we redirected our sales and marketing efforts away from our traditional fee for service customer base to physicians who have a large percentage of managed care patients 
we recognized that there is a larger market opportunity among physicians whose patients are covered by managed care plans because the portion of prescriptions covered by managed care plans is increasing relative to the portion of fee for service prescriptions 
further  we believe that our technology can give us a competitive advantage where more patients prescriptions are covered by managed care plans because our products streamline the process by which physicians  managed care organizations and patients interact 
in addition  we believe that the managed care market provides us with the opportunity to realize higher margins on our software products 
we currently derive our revenue from the sale of prepackaged medications  software licenses  computer hardware  electronic information and education products and related services 
in the years ended december   and  sales of prepackaged medications represented  and  respectively  of total revenue 
our shift in focus to physicians who desire technology based services to operate successfully in a managed care environment and away from physicians with a high percentage of fee for service patients is reflected in the composition of our revenue  as depicted in the following table quarter ended june sept

march march june dec 
unaudited in thousands traditional revenue         e commerce revenue        total revenue         traditional revenue includes all non e commerce revenue and is derived from the sale  through non internet channels  of prescription medications and other medical products to physicians who do not use our software 
we expect traditional revenue to represent a decreasing percentage of total revenue in the future 
e commerce revenue is derived from the sale of prescription medications over the internet to physicians who use our software or who order products from us primarily over the internet 
e commerce revenue also includes technology related revenue for software subscriptions  licenses and related professional services  computer hardware sales and leases  transaction fees  e detailing and related services 
for the year ended december   sales of prepackaged medications represented of e commerce revenue 
for the year ended december   of e commerce revenue represented medication sales over the internet without the use of touchscript ordering 
while we expect a portion of future e commerce revenue to continue to represent a shifting of traditional revenue  we anticipate that most of the future growth in e commerce revenue will be generated by physician practice groups that are not currently our customers 
factors that we expect will attract future customers include an interest in physician dispensing  a desire to minimize financial risk imposed by managed care payers with respect to medications that they prescribe and concern about the potential liability associated with medication errors 
we believe that managed care prescription programs will continue to cover an increasing percentage of patients in the foreseeable future 
this trend will have the effect of reducing the dispensing opportunities of our traditional dispensing customers because of their inability to submit claims electronically for reimbursement by managed care payers 
this reduction in dispensing opportunities will reduce the revenue that we have historically recognized from these customers 
additionally  managed care programs impose reduced reimbursement rates for the medications dispensed to their plan participants  thus providing us with a dollar margin per prescription dispensed that is lower than we have historically experienced 
because touchscript enables physicians to submit claims electronically for reimbursement by managed care payers  a large portion of the medications dispensed by our touchscript customers is dispensed to managed care patients 
accordingly  we expect that the fastest growing portion of our business will provide margins with respect to the sale of prepackaged medications that are lower than we have historically experienced 
in addition  we expect that seasonal variances in demand for our products and services will continue 
historically  all other factors aside  our sales of prepackaged medications have been highest in the fall and winter months 
to maintain our position in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive marketplace  we expect to continue to increase the number of our sales  sales support  product development and customer service personnel significantly  and  accordingly  we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase 
in addition  we expect to amortize unearned compensation expense totaling approximately  through december  in addition to medication management  we believe that there are other aspects of the physician s daily work flow that can be effectively addressed through technology focused solutions 
we have enhanced and intend to continue to enhance our current offerings by integrating new products and services that address these needs 
in furtherance of this strategy  in may  we acquired masterchart  inc  a software developer providing dictation  integration and patient record technology  and medifor  inc  a provider of internet delivered patient education 
in connection with these acquisitions  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately   of which will be amortized over two years  and the balance of which will be amortized over five years 
in  we completed another acquisition that resulted in additional goodwill of approximately  which is being amortized over two years 
in addition  on january   we acquired channelhealth incorporated in exchange for approximately  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately  and approximately  common stock options with a fair value of approximately  in replacement of outstanding channelhealth common stock options 
this acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase and we expect to record goodwill and other intangible assets equal to a substantial portion of the purchase price 
under current accounting rules  these intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated economic life  which ranges from five to years 
additional stock based consideration will be granted to the sellers of channelhealth if certain revenue targets are achieved during those revenue targets  if achieved  will result in the recording of additional purchase price at the time that the targets are met 
we also anticipate that there will be additional cash required to fund the ongoing operations of channelhealth 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded total unearned stock compensation of approximately   and  respectively  in connection with stock options granted during the period 
these amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of stock option grants and the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grants 
these amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options  resulting in approximately   and  in selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization of unearned compensation expense for each of the next three fiscal years is expected to be as follows amount year ended in thousands december  december  december  in march  in order to focus all of management s attention and resources on its physician medication management business and due to the significant resources necessary to remain competitive and sustain profitability in the pharmacy benefit management business  we sold substantially all of the assets  excluding cash and accounts receivable  of our pharmacy benefit management business 
the total consideration was approximately  in cash at closing and a contingent payment based upon achieving certain milestones for the one year period following the closing 
during the year ended december   we received a contingent payment of  net of related expenses 
this business had net sales of  and  in and  respectively  while recording an operating profit of   and  in  and  respectively 
the profit in was due to the recovery of certain receivables previously fully reserved 
our financial statements and the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflect the pharmacy benefit management business as a discontinued operation 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized gains on the sale of this business of  and  respectively  based upon the consideration received 
in  we completed acquisitions through the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately  and a promissory note in the principal amount of  bearing interest at per year and payable upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
we repaid the promissory note  including accrued interest of  in august on may   we acquired masterchart  inc  a software developer providing dictation  integration and patient record technology  in exchange for  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately  and cash of  approximately  of the purchase price was allocated to the value of acquired in process research and development that had no alternative future use and was charged against operations during the three months ended june  in addition  approximately  of the purchase price was allocated to acquired software and is being amortized on a straight line basis over two years  the software s estimated useful life 
trademarks and goodwill  totaling approximately  are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years

in exchange for all of the outstanding common and preferred a and b stock of medifor  allscripts issued  shares of its common stock with a fair value of approximately  in addition  allscripts issued  common stock options in replacement of medifor common stock options with a fair value of approximately  the fair value of the replacement common stock options was estimated using the black scholes model 
approximately  of the purchase price was allocated to the value of acquired in process research and development that had no alternative future use and was charged against operations during the three months ended june  trademarks and goodwill totaling  are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
in  we completed another acquisition through the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a cash payment of  the acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
on january   we completed the acquisition of channelhealth incorporated in exchange for  shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately  the issuance of approximately  common stock options as replacement of outstanding channelhealth common stock options with a fair value of approximately  and transaction costs totaling approximately  we will pay additional stock based consideration if certain revenue targets are achieved during results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as a percentage of our revenue year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles write off of acquired in process research and development other operating expenses loss from operations interest income expense  net other expense  net loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations gain from sale of discontinued operations loss before extraordinary items extraordinary loss from early extinguishment of debt

selling  general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased by or  from  in to  in due primarily to additional spending for sales and sales support personnel and related expenses needed to sell  implement and support touchscript installations and our e detailing product  expenses related to masterchart and medifor operations that were acquired during may and telemed operations that were acquired during may  additional spending for touchscript and internet product development personnel and related support expenses  and an increase in non cash charges related to stock options issued to non employees

the decrease in traditional revenue reflects a shifting of traditional revenue to e commerce as outlined above and the attrition of traditional customers  as well as reduced levels of prepackaged medication dispensing by our traditional customers due to the increased penetration of managed care prescription programs

selected quarterly operating results our quarterly results of operations have generally been seasonal  with a greater proportion of our revenue typically occurring in the first and fourth quarters 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to the fact that more prescriptions are written in the winter months

on july   allscripts completed the initial public offering of its common stock 
allscripts issued  shares of common stock at an initial public offering price of per share and all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
the initial public offering resulted in gross proceeds of   of which was applied to the underwriting discount and approximately  of which was applied to related offering expenses

we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet the anticipated cash needs of our current business for the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
we will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas  as amended  establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities  and is effective in the first quarter of we currently do not invest in derivative investments nor do we engage in hedging activities

in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no

the adoption of sab during the fourth quarter of did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this report 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to allscripts healthcare solutions  inc if physicians do not accept our products and services  our growth will be impaired 
our business model depends on our ability to sell the touchscript system and physician channel applications and services to physicians and other healthcare providers and to generate usage by a large number of physicians 
we have not achieved this goal with previous or currently available versions of the touchscript system or the physician channel applications and services 
physician acceptance of our products and services will require physicians to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
we cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products and services into their office work flow or that participants in the pharmaceutical healthcare market will accept our products and services as a replacement for traditional methods of conducting healthcare transactions 
achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the pharmaceutical healthcare industry 
if we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products and services by physicians and other healthcare participants or to position our services as a preferred method for pharmaceutical healthcare delivery and information management  our prospects for growth will be diminished 
we are currently experiencing losses and we may not become profitable in the future 
we are currently experiencing losses and cannot assure you that we will become profitable in the foreseeable future  if ever 
for the year ended december   allscripts  inc had a net loss of  historically  channelhealth has also incurred significant net losses  and since channelhealth has only recently implemented its business strategy  we expect channelhealth to continue to incur losses at least through additionally  channelhealth has spent significant amounts on research and development and sales and marketing efforts  and we expect these costs to continue 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future 
because our business model is new and unproven  our operating history is not indicative of our future performance  and our business is difficult to evaluate 
because we have not yet successfully implemented our business model  we do not have an operating history upon which you can evaluate our prospects  and you should not rely upon our past performance to predict our future performance 
since its inception as an independent company in september  channelhealth s operating activities have consisted largely of developing the software applications necessary to provide its services  and channelhealth has only recently begun to sell its software and services to provider organizations 
in addition  channelhealth s long term success will depend largely on the success of its strategic relationships and the strategic alliance between us and idx 
channelhealth is still in the early stages of its current strategic relationships and we are unable to predict whether the goals of those relationships will be achieved 
channelhealth s limited operating history and limited experience with its strategic business partners make it difficult to evaluate its business and its prospects 
our operating history is not necessarily indicative of our future performance under our new business model 
in attempting to implement our business model  we are significantly changing our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we are also facing new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets  the need to develop strategic relationships and other risks described below 
we may face difficulties in integrating the operations and products of channelhealth and allscripts  inc channelhealth and allscripts  inc operated separately until january  our management team does not have experience with the combined business 
integration of product lines will involve consolidation of products with duplicative functionality  coordination of research and development activities and convergence of the technologies supporting the various products 
we may not be able to integrate the products  product development  information systems and operations of channelhealth and allscripts  inc without a loss of key officers  employees  customers or suppliers  a loss of revenues or an increase in net loss  an increase in operating or other costs or other difficulties 
in addition  we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies  the material expansion of our customer base to idx customers or the other benefits expected from the merger and related transactions such as our strategic alliance with idx 
any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with this integration could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the business separation of channelhealth from idx may impair assets 
the separation of channelhealth from the rest of idx s businesses  assets and liabilities pursuant to the asset purchase agreement between idx and channelhealth required the transfer of assets  including intellectual property rights  between channelhealth and idx 
some of these transfers may have triggered channelhealth liabilities that are not yet known by channelhealth 
generally  idx will be responsible for these liabilities but idx would not be required to indemnify channelhealth for any losses that are consequential  in the nature of lost profits  diminution in value  damage to reputation or the like  special or punitive damages 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and create new relationships with managed care payers  our prospects for growth will suffer 
we rely on managed care organizations to reimburse our physician customers for prescription medications dispensed in their offices 
while many of the leading managed care payers and pharmacy benefit managers currently reimburse our physicians for in office dispensing  none of these payers is under a long term obligation to do so 
if we are unable to increase the number of managed care payers that reimburse for in office dispensing  or if some or all of the payers who currently reimburse physicians decline to do so in the future  utilization of our products and  therefore  our growth will be impaired 
our growth and revenues could suffer if we are unable to enter into and maintain relationships with idx customers 
we seek to increase channelhealth s subscriber base through targeting provider organizations that use idx practice management systems or other idx services  and affiliates of these organizations 
channelhealth s services use the web framework technology  which it licenses from idx  and which enables its software applications and services to be tightly integrated with idx practice management systems and provide real time synchronization of data 
if channelhealth s relationship with idx terminates  its services might not be as attractive to idx customers and channelhealth may not have access to this potential customer base  idx might enter into arrangements that would allow channelhealth s competitors to utilize idx technology and idx could compete against channelhealth 
if any of these situations were to occur  our expected revenues may be lower  our business may be harmed and our stock price may fall 
our business will be harmed if we cannot maintain the strategic alliance agreement and the cross license agreement with idx 
upon completion of the mergers  we entered into a year strategic alliance agreement with idx pursuant to which we and idx agreed to coordinate product development and align our respective marketing processes 
under this agreement idx granted us the exclusive right to market  sell  license and distribute ambulatory point of care and clinical application products to idx customers 
this agreement does not  however  limit idx s continued development and distribution of its own lastword or radiology products and services 
our business strategy includes targeting current and prospective idx customers and their affiliates 
if we fail to successfully implement that business strategy  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the price paid for channelhealth 
if the strategic alliance agreement is terminated  we would lose access to an important customer base 
after the expiration or termination of the strategic alliance agreement  we may not be able to align with another company to market and distribute our products on as favorable a basis as that represented by the idx strategic alliance 
this would harm our growth and revenue 
in addition  prior to the termination of this agreement  we cannot allow certain specified idx direct competitors to market  distribute or sell our or channelhealth s services  even if that agreement would benefit our business 
also upon completion of the mergers  channelhealth entered into an amended and restated cross license and software maintenance agreement with idx pursuant to which channelhealth granted idx a license to use  market and sublicense its products combined with idx products  and idx granted channelhealth a license to use  market and sublicense idx software for use with channelhealth products 
if this agreement is terminated  channelhealth will not have access to idx software  which would harm our ability to integrate our services with idx systems and provide real time data synchronization 
this would make channelhealth s systems less desirable to idx customers and would harm its business 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products  our business prospects will be impaired 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to introduce new products and to introduce these new products on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products or our products currently under development on schedule  or at all 
in addition  early releases of software often contain errors or defects 
we cannot assure you that  despite our extensive testing  errors will not be found in our new product releases and services before or after commercial release  which would result in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  market acceptance 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
our business will not be successful unless we establish and maintain strategic relationships 
to be successful  we must establish and maintain strategic relationships with leaders in a number of healthcare and internet industry segments 
this is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships will enable us to 
extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians and to other participants in the healthcare industry  
develop and deploy new products  
further enhance the allscripts and channelhealth brands  and 
generate additional revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  many potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships  are in the early stages of development and may not achieve the objectives that we seek 
on june   channelhealth and idx entered into agreements with healtheon webmd corp 
pursuant to which healtheon webmd agreed to provide electronic transaction and content services to channelhealth and idx 
pursuant to the agreement  healtheon webmd s content is to be integrated into channelhealth s physician channel and patient channel internet services 
healtheon webmd further committed to a multi million dollar campaign promoting idx and channelhealth products and services that incorporate healtheon webmd content and transactions 
healtheon webmd has recently informed idx that it believes channelhealth and idx will be unable to perform their obligations to healtheon webmd now that a strategic alliance between idx and us has been consummated 
healtheon webmd also stated that it would seek to terminate the channelhealth agreement and would propose a restructured relationship with idx 
we believe that channelhealth s and idx s performance will not be impaired by the strategic alliance with us and that healtheon webmd does not have a basis for unilaterally terminating the channelhealth agreement or restructuring the idx agreement 
in addition  pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement between idx and us  we and idx each agree not to take any action that would cause a default under or termination of the agreement between channelhealth and healtheon webmd 
we have limited experience in establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with healthcare and internet industry participants 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 
in the event the healtheon webmd agreement is terminated  our expected revenues for may be significantly lower than currently anticipated  our business may be harmed and our stock price may fall 
if potential customers take a long time to evaluate the purchase of our products and services  we could incur additional selling expenses and require additional working capital 
the length of the sales cycle for our current touchscript product and physician channel services depend on a number of factors  including the nature and size of the potential customer and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer  and is difficult to predict 
our marketing efforts with respect to large healthcare organizations generally involve a lengthy sales cycle due to these organizations complex decision making processes 
if potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to purchase our solutions  our selling expenses could increase  and we may need to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need to 
if we cannot keep pace with advances in technology  our business could be harmed 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
because the internet and healthcare information markets are characterized by rapid technological change  we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
our future success depends upon our ability to grow  and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
we will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
an unexpectedly large increase in the volume or pace of traffic on our web site or the number of orders placed by customers may require us to expand and further upgrade our technology 
we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases in the use of our web site accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases 
difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  we may be unable to replace them  and our business could be negatively affected 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our management and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in particular  the services of glen e 
tullman  our chairman and chief executive officer  and david b 
mullen  our president and chief financial officer  are integral to the execution of our business strategy 
if one or more of our key employees leaves our employment we will have to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy 
because competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive  we believe that the loss of the services of key personnel could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy successfully  our ability to expand our product and service offerings and our customer base may be limited 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company and our inability to maintain the goodwill of the acquired businesses 
in order to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business by reaching new customers  we may continue to acquire businesses that we believe are complementary 
the successful implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire companies on acceptable terms  integrate their operations and technology successfully with our own and maintain the goodwill of the acquired business 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
moreover  in pursuing acquisition opportunities  we may compete for acquisition targets with other companies with similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
we have taken  and in the future may take  charges against earnings in connection with acquisitions 
the costs and expenses incurred may exceed the estimates upon which we based these charges 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position will suffer 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including touchscript and the physician channel applications and services 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity  and we may incur substantial costs as a result 
if we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive products 
while we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any valid proprietary rights of third parties  an infringement claim has been asserted against us  and we cannot assure you that additional infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
factors beyond our control could cause interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our results of operations 
to succeed  we must be able to operate our systems without interruption 
certain of our communications and information services are provided through our service providers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by damage from a variety of sources  many of which are not within our control  including 
power loss and telecommunications failures  
software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  
computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and 
fire  flood and other natural disasters 
we have no comprehensive plans for these contingencies 
any significant interruptions in our services would damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may be liable for use of data we provide 
we provide data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients 
third party contractors provide us with most of this data 
although no claims have been brought against us alleging injuries related to the use of our data  claims may be made in the future 
while we maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business  we cannot assure you that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could materially harm our financial condition 
if our security is breached  we could be subject to liability  and people could be deterred from using our services 
the difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to conducting e commerce and engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our strategy relies on the use of the internet to transmit confidential information 
we believe that any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter people from using the internet for these purposes  and from using our system to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential healthcare information 
it is also possible that third parties could penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate patient information and other data 
if this happens  our operations could be interrupted  and we could be subject to liability 
we may have to devote significant financial and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
we could face financial loss  litigation and other liabilities to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of confidential information like patient records or credit information 
in addition  we could incur additional expenses when and if the new rules recently published by the us department of health and human services regarding the use of personal information become effective 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future needs  our growth prospects and our ability to respond to competitive pressures will be impaired 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if our content and service providers fail to perform adequately  our reputation in the marketplace and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent content and service providers for many of the benefits we provide through our touchscript system and our physician channel applications and services  including the maintenance of managed care pharmacy guidelines  drug interaction reviews and the routing of transaction data to third party payers 
any problems with our providers that result in interruptions of our services or a failure of our services to function as desired could damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have no means of replacing content or services on a timely basis or at all if they are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure 
we also expect to rely on independent content providers for the majority of the clinical  educational and other healthcare information that we plan to provide on our web site 
in addition  we will depend on our content providers to deliver high quality content from reliable sources and to continually upgrade their content in response to demand and evolving healthcare industry trends 
any failure by these parties to develop and maintain high quality  attractive content could impair the value of the allscripts and channelhealth brands and our results of operations 
if third party payers force us to reduce our prices  our results of operations could suffer 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale  including over the internet  of prepackaged medications to physicians 
we may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales of prepackaged medications arising from various sources  including practices of managed care organizations and any governmental action requiring or allowing pharmaceutical reimbursement under medicare 
if our pricing of prepackaged medications experiences significant downward pressure  our business will be less profitable 
if we incur costs exceeding our insurance coverage in lawsuits pending against us or that are brought against us in the future  it could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
allscripts is a defendant in numerous multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine 
in addition  allscripts and certain members of management are defendants in shareholder class action litigation 
while we do not believe we or our management have any significant liability in these lawsuits  in the event we or members of our management were found liable in these lawsuits or in any other lawsuits filed against us in the future  and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see legal proceedings 
if our principal supplier fails or is unable to perform its contract with us  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers 
we currently purchase a majority of the medications that we repackage from mckesson hboc  inc we have an agreement with this supplier that expires in september if we do not meet certain minimum purchasing requirements  mckesson may increase the prices that we pay under this agreement  in which case we would have the option to terminate the agreement 
although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of medications  if mckesson fails or is unable to perform under our agreement  particularly at certain critical times during the year  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers  and our relationships with our customers could suffer 
because of anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  takeovers may be more difficult  possibly preventing you from obtaining optimal share price 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and by laws provide for a classified board of directors and allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
risks related to our industry if the healthcare environment becomes more restrictive  or we do not comply with healthcare regulations  our existing and future operations may be curtailed  and we could be subject to liability 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships are regulated by a number of federal  state and local governmental entities 
because our business relationships with physicians are unique  and the healthcare electronic commerce industry as a whole is relatively young  the application of many state and federal regulations to our business operations is uncertain 
it is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect us 
in addition  the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth 

electronic prescribing 
the use of our touchscript software by physicians to perform electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law 
the application of these laws to our business is uncertain because many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate methods of e commerce now being developed 
the laws of many jurisdictions neither specifically permit nor specifically prohibit electronic transmission of prescription orders 
future regulation of these areas may adversely affect us 

licensure 
as a repackager and distributor of drugs  we are subject to regulation by and licensure with the united states food and drug administration  the united states drug enforcement administration and various state agencies that regulate wholesalers or distributors 
among the regulations applicable to our repackaging operation are the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
because the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations were designed to govern the manufacture  rather than the repackaging  of drugs  we face legal uncertainty concerning the application of some aspects of these regulations and of the standards that the fda will enforce 
both the fda and the dea have the right  at any time  to inspect our facilities and operations to determine if we are operating in compliance with the requirements for licensure and all applicable laws and regulations 
along with many other drug repackagers  we have received an fda warning letter alleging violations of fda regulations  including the good manufacturing practice regulations 
we have implemented procedures intended to address many of the concerns raised by the fda in that letter and believe that our compliance with fda regulations meets or exceeds the standard in the drug repackaging industry 
we also believe that we possess all licenses required to operate our business 
if  however  we do not maintain all necessary licenses  or the fda decides to substantially modify the manner in which it has historically enforced its good manufacturing practice regulations against drug repackagers or the fda or dea finds any violations during one of their periodic inspections  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be shut down 

physician dispensing 
physician dispensing of medications for profit is allowed in all states except utah and is prohibited  subject to extremely limited exceptions  in massachusetts  montana and texas 
in addition  new jersey and new york allow physician dispensing of medications for profit  but limit the number of days supply of all medications  subject to limited exceptions  that a physician may dispense  several other states limit the number of days supply of controlled substances that a physician may dispense 
other states may enact legislation or regulations prohibiting or restricting physician dispensing 
the american medical association  through certain of its constituent bodies  has historically taken inconsistent positions on physician dispensing  alternately discouraging and supporting it 
while the ama s council on ethical and judicial affairs in discouraged physicians from regularly dispensing prescription pharmaceuticals  in the ama s house of delegates adopted the following resolution resolved  that the american medical association support the physician s right to dispense drugs and devices when it is in the best interest of the patient and consistent with the ama s ethical guidelines 
this position was reaffirmed by the ama house of delegates in january the ama s ethical guidelines provide in relevant part that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices provided there is no resulting exploitation of patients 
while two recent reports of the council on ethical and judicial affairs oppose the in office sale of health related products by physicians  these reports specifically exclude the sale of prescription items from their scope  although they do refer to the council s report 

stark ii 
congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self referrals in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of this law  commonly referred to as stark ii  applies to physician dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
we believe that the physicians who use our touchscript system or dispense drugs distributed by us are doing so in material compliance with stark ii  either pursuant to an in office ancillary services exception or another applicable exception 
while our physician customers currently do not  to any significant degree  dispense drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  if they were to and if it were determined that the physicians who use our system or dispense pharmaceuticals purchased from us were not in compliance with stark ii  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 

drug distribution 
as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  we and our customers are also subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which applies to medicare  medicaid and other state and federal programs 
the statute prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase of goods  including drugs  covered by the programs 
the anti kickback law provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
we believe that our arrangements with our customers are in material compliance with the anti kickback statute and relevant safe harbors 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws  and we believe that we are in material compliance with those laws 
if  however  it were determined that we were not in compliance with those laws  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be curtailed 

claims transmission 
as part of our services provided to physicians  our system will electronically transmit claims for prescription medications dispensed by a physician to many patients managed care organizations and payers for immediate approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides that it is both a civil and a criminal violation for any person to submit a claim to any payer  including  for example  medicare  medicaid and all private health plans or managed care plans seeking payment for any services or products that have not been provided to the patient or overbilling for services or products provided 
we have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system are accurate and complete  provided that the information given to us by our customer is also accurate and complete 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted  we could be subject to liability 

patient information 
existing federal and state laws and regulations regulate the disclosure of confidential medical information  including information regarding conditions like aids  substance abuse and mental illness 
in addition  the us department of health and human services recently published rules regarding the disclosure of confidential medical information 
there is uncertainty as to when those rules will be effective and how they will be interpreted 
further  the rules and their interpretation are subject to change from time to time 
in the event that the rules are interpreted in a way that requires material change to the way in which allscripts does business  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
as part of the operation of our business  our customers do provide to us patient identifiable medical information related to the prescription drugs that they prescribe and other aspects of patient treatment 
we have policies and procedures that we believe assure compliance with all federal and state confidentiality requirements for handling of confidential medical information we receive 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information  we could be subject to liability  fines and lawsuits  or our operations could be shut down 
the bush administration has announced that it intends to propose broad medicare reform legislation that would make available to medicare recipients a subsidized prescription drug benefit 
while no federal price controls are included in the current version of the proposed legislation  any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products 
we cannot predict whether or when future health care reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed  enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the new and rapidly evolving internet and electronic healthcare information markets fail to develop as quickly as expected  our business prospects will be impaired 
the internet and electronic healthcare information markets are in the early stages of development and are rapidly evolving 
a number of market entrants have introduced or developed products and services that are competitive with one or more components of the solutions we offer 
in addition  several companies have recently introduced or announced their intention to introduce electronic prescribing products 
we expect that additional companies will continue to enter these markets 
in new and rapidly evolving industries  there is significant uncertainty and risk as to the demand for  and market acceptance of  recently introduced products and services 
because the markets for our products and services are new and evolving  we are not able to predict the size and growth rate of the markets with any certainty 
we cannot assure you that markets for our products and services will develop or that  if they do  they will be strong and continue to grow at a sufficient pace 
if markets fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  our business prospects will be impaired 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense  and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if we were forced to reduce our prices  our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
if the internet infrastructure does not continue to improve  our ability to use the internet on a large scale could be compromised 
if the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and the level of use  then the internet infrastructure may not be able to continue to support the demands placed on it 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial medium because of inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  lack of timely development of complementary products like high speed modems  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity or increased government regulation 
because our business plan relies heavily on the viability of the internet  our business will suffer if growth of the internet does not meet our expectations 
risks related to our stock the public market for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including 
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  
announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by us or our competitors  
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  
conditions and trends in the electronic healthcare information  internet  e commerce and pharmaceutical markets  and 
general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets  especially the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies  and internet related companies in particular 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions like recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
volatility in the market price for our common stock may result in the filing of securities class action litigation 
on october   allscripts  inc announced that its previously reported revenues for the second quarter of were being revised from  to  between october and december  four complaints were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois against allscripts and its president and chief financial officer  david b 
mullen 
the complaints purported to be brought on behalf of a class of individuals who purchased the common stock of allscripts during the period of july  through and including october  the class period  and alleged violations of section b and a of the securities exchange act of based on the restatement of our financial results for the second quarter of the four complaints were deemed related  and the cases were reassigned and consolidated for all purposes before judge charles kocoras  before whom the first filed case was pending 
the consolidated action is entitled in re allscripts  inc securities litigation  no

in january  lead plaintiff and lead counsel were appointed in the consolidated case 
on march   plaintiffs filed a consolidated and amended class action complaint the amended complaint 
the amended complaint continues to name allscripts and david b 
mullen as defendants and alleges violations of section b and a of the securities exchange act 
three additional defendants are named in the amended complaint glen e 
tullman  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  j 
peter geerlofs  our chief medical officer  and philip j 
langley  formerly our senior vice president of business development field services 
the amended complaint purports to expand the class period in the consolidated case to include all individuals who purchased the common stock of allscripts during the period from march  through and including february  the amended complaint is based on the previous allegations about the restatement of our financial results for the second quarter of  and new allegations relating to  inter alia  the prospects for our touchscript product 
we intend to move to dismiss the amended complaint  and judge kocoras has set june as the prospective ruling date 
at this time  management is unable to determine the likely outcome of this matter or to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss with respect to this matter 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
the quarterly operating results of our subsidiaries have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  including seasonal variances in demand for our products and services  the sales  installation and implementation cycles for our touchscript system and physician channel applications and services and other factors described in this risk factors section of this report 
for example  all other factors aside  sales of our prepackaged medications have historically been highest in the fall and winter months 
we expect to increase activities and spending in substantially all of our operational areas 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenue  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer 
we may have substantial sales of our common stock that could cause our stock price to fall 
allscripts  inc s common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market on july   however  until recently there have been a limited number of shares trading in the public market 
a substantial number of our shares have become eligible for public sale  and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall 
because our executive officers and directors have substantial control of our voting stock  takeovers not supported by them will be more difficult  possibly preventing you from obtaining optimal share price 
the control of a significant amount of our stock by insiders could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own or control  shares or of the outstanding common stock 
if our executive officers and directors choose to act or vote together  they will have the power to influence significantly all matters requiring the approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
without the consent of these stockholders  we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we did not own any derivative financial instruments but we were exposed to market risks  primarily changes in us interest rates 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in financial instruments of  maturities range from less than one month to approximately years  with the majority being less than one year 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our interest income from our investments 
based upon our balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease in interest rates of would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income by approximately
