in contrast  the operating activities for the second and third quarters generated substantial cash  totaling million and million  respectively  as the company shipped inventory and collected accounts receivable

such cash income taxes could also result from increased taxable income due to  among other reasons i any slowdown in  or elimination of  future growth in the company s inventory of growing plants or ii limits on the company s ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset all of its tax liability under the alternative minimum tax system
