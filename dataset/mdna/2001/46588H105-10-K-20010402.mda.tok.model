an impression is the viewing of promotional material on a web page  which may include banner advertisements  links  buttons  or other text or images 
as part of certain sponsorship agreements  sponsors who also sell products may provide ivillage with a commission on sales of their products generated through ivillage s web site 
to date  these amounts have not been significant

in attempting to integrate the business and technology of women 
com  ivillage will incur significant costs which may harm its business

com 
successful integration of women 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel will place a significant burden on the management and internal resources of the combined company

upon the closing of the merger  ivillage will commence the integration of women 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel 
ivillage will strive to maintain the companies relationships with key customers and joint venturers 
integration efforts may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on strategic plans  personnel and other decisions 
integration may be made more difficult because ivillage s operations are centered in new york while women 
com s operations are centered in california 
ivillage does not know whether it will be successful in these integration efforts and it cannot assure you that it will be able to integrate the business and operations of women 
com in a timely and efficient manner 
if ivillage cannot successfully integrate women 
com s operations  technology  web sites  products  customers and personnel and maintain its and women

following the merger  hearst communications is expected to own approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage common stock and will have three representatives on the ivillage board of directors  and therefore hearst communications will be able to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies 
following the merger  hearst communications is expected to own approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage common stock 
this assumption assumes that o no women 
com stockholders participate in the rights offering  o hearst communications is not required to  and does not elect to  purchase additional ivillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement  and o there are  shares of ivillage common stock outstanding after the merger 
in addition o if the actual cash and working capital of women 
com as of march  is less than million of cash and million of working capital  then hearst communications would have the option to purchase additional shares of ivillage common stock in an amount equal to the amount of the shortfall up to million divided by  or o if the shortfall is more than million as of march   but less than million  then hearst communications must purchase additional shares of ivillage common stock pursuant to the merger agreement for the amount of the shortfall which exceeds million  and hearst communications will have the option to purchase shares with respect to the additional million shortfall amount 
in addition  if women 
com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the shares of women 
com outstanding on april  exercise dissenters rights under delaware law  then hearst communications would be required  if requested by ivillage  to purchase additional shares of ivillage common stock 
any shares of ivillage common stock purchased by hearst communications as a result of a cash or working capital shortfall would be purchased at a per share price of 
if hearst communications is required to purchase additional shares of ivillage common stock because women 
com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the shares of women 
com outstanding on april  exercise dissenters rights under delaware law  those shares would also be purchased at a per share price of 
the number of shares so purchased would be calculated by multiplying the number of women 
com shares associated with the exercise of appraisal rights in excess of the two percent threshold by the exchange ratio subject to adjustment  rounded down to the nearest whole share 
in addition  hearst communications will hold a warrant entitling it to purchase up to  shares of ivillage common stock  less the number of shares of ivillage common stock represented by warrants subscribed for by the other stockholders of women 
com in the rights offering 
hearst communications has agreed not to participate in the rights offering 
accordingly  any shares of ivillage common stock that hearst communications acquires from ivillage will be shares which are acquired either pursuant to the merger agreement or the amended and restated securities purchase agreement 
pursuant to a stockholder agreement to be entered into between ivillage and hearst communications  ivillage must appoint three representatives of hearst communications to ivillage s board of directors  with one hearst communications designee appointed to each class of director 
the stockholder agreement provides that the number of hearst communications representatives is subject to reduction if hearst communications ownership of ivillage common stock falls below certain threshold levels 
there will also be a hearst communications representative on each of the ivillage nominating and compensation committees 
hearst communications board representation and stock ownership will allow hearst communications to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies  including any mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  strategic relationships or sales of assets 
this board representation and stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which ivillage stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  the interests of hearst communications  which owns or has significant investments in other businesses  including cable television networks  newspapers  magazines and electronic media  may from time to time be competitive with  or otherwise diverge from  ivillage s interests  particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future acquisitions 
although hearst communications is required to vote all shares that it holds in excess of subject to adjustment of ivillage s voting securities in accordance with the recommendation of the ivillage board of directors  hearst communications may effectively control stockholder actions  including approving changes to ivillage s certificate of incorporation or bylaws and adopting or changing equity incentive plans 
hearst communications effective control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger  consolidation  sale of all or substantially all of ivillage s assets or other form of change of control that ivillage might consider 
exercise of the warrants will cause dilution to the ivillage stockholders and could negatively impact the price of ivillage common stock 
exercise of warrants  whether by hearst communications or by women 
com stockholders acquiring them in the rights offering  would cause dilution to the voting power and interests of the then current ivillage stockholders and to the net income or loss per share of ivillage common stock 
in addition  the sale of a significant number of the shares of ivillage common stock acquired on exercise of the warrants in the open market could cause a decline in the market value of ivillage common stock 
stockholders of ivillage will experience additional ownership dilution if hearst communications is required  or elects  to purchase additional shares of ivillage common stock in the event of a women 
com cash or working capital shortfall as of march   or in the event that women 
com stockholders holding in excess of two percent of the shares of women 
com outstanding as of the record date exercise dissenters rights under delaware law 
risks relating to current and future operations ivillage has a limited operating history and may face difficulties encountered in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which it operates 
ivillage has a limited operating history and face many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly evolving markets  including the internet advertising market 
the risks and difficulties that will be faced by ivillage include its ability to o attract a larger audience to ivillage 
com  o increase awareness of the ivillage brand  o strengthen user loyalty  o offer compelling content  o maintain current  and develop new  strategic relationships  o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries  o respond effectively to competitive pressures  o continue to develop and upgrade ivillage s technology  and o attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and has recent and anticipated continuing losses 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
ivillage incurred net losses attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december   ivillage s accumulated deficit was million 
ivillage expects to continue to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and  as a result  it will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
although ivillage s revenues have generally grown in recent quarters  there can be no assurance that it will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if ivillage does achieve profitability  there can be no assurance that it will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if revenues grow slower than ivillage anticipates  or if operating expenses exceed ivillage s expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  its business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
because ivillage s strategy includes acquisitions of and joint ventures with other businesses  acquisition and joint venture expenses and any cash used to make these acquisitions and joint ventures will reduce its available cash 
ivillage s quarterly revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance  are difficult to forecast and have been and are likely to continue to fluctuate 
as a result of ivillage s limited operating history  ivillage does not have historical financial data for a significant number of periods upon which to forecast quarterly revenues and results of operations 
ivillage does not believe that period to period comparisons of its operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance 
in addition  the operating results of ivillage are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of several factors  many of which are outside ivillage s control  and any of which could materially harm the business of ivillage 
these factors include o fluctuations in the demand for internet advertising or electronic commerce  o bankruptcies or other payment default of internet companies which are a source of advertising revenues  o changes in the level of traffic on its network  and o fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs 
ivillage s revenues for the foreseeable future will remain dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on its web sites 
future revenues are difficult to forecast 
ivillage plans to expand and develop content  and to upgrade and enhance its technology and infrastructure development in order to support its growth 
ivillage may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular quarter  which may materially and adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
in one or more future quarters  ivillage s results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if ivillage s results of operations fall below expectations  the trading price of its common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the revenues of ivillage in a particular quarter are lower than anticipated  ivillage may be unable to reduce spending in that quarter 
if ivillage has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its expenses  then ivillage s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
ivillage may need to raise additional capital and its prospects for obtaining additional financing are uncertain 
ivillage currently anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents that will be available to ivillage upon completion of the merger cannot be accurately predicted and depends on many factors  including the amount of revenues received and expenses incurred by each company during the period prior to the merger and the date on which the merger is completed 
accordingly  the combined company may need to raise additional funds in the near future to fund its operations 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the combined company on acceptable terms  or at all 
in particular  unless the market price of ivillage s common stock increases dramatically  it is unlikely that the company will be able to raise funds through a public offering of its common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  the combined company would have to scale back its business and its business and financial condition would be harmed  or it may be forced to cease its operations entirely 
ivillage common stock may be delisted and  if it is delisted  trading in ivillage common stock would decrease substantially and the market price of ivillage common stock may decline further 
as of the close of the market on march   the minimum bid price of ivillage common stock had been below for consecutive trading days 
if the minimum bid price of ivillage common stock is below for consecutive trading days  nasdaq will send a notice to ivillage informing the company that unless it is able to regain compliance with the required minimum bid price of within calendar days of the date of the notice  ivillage common stock will be delisted from trading by nasdaq 
in that event  trading of ivillage shares would decrease substantially or possibly cease altogether  and the market price of ivillage common stock may decline further  potentially to zero 
ivillage s business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow 
ivillage s market is new and rapidly evolving 
ivillage s business would be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly usage by women 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security concerns  o inconsistent quality of service  o lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for information  shopping and services  and o privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather information about users without their knowledge or consent 
if internet usage continues to grow significantly  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  web sites have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these outages and delays frequently occur in the future  internet usage  including the usage of ivillage web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
the market for internet advertising is still developing 
if the internet fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising  ivillage would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater than expected losses 
ivillage expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future  as demand and market acceptance for internet advertising continues to develop 
accordingly  ivillage s business depends on market acceptance of the internet as a medium for advertising 
although there are currently several standards for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet advertising  the industry has had difficulty convincing potential advertisers that internet advertising is a significant advertising medium 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising 
in addition  advertisers and advertising agencies that use the internet as an advertising medium may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services than traditional advertising media  including television  radio and print 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
the market for online advertising also depends on the overall growth and acceptance of electronic commerce 
if the markets for online advertising and electronic commerce fail to develop or develop more slowly than ivillage expects  or if ivillage is unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising  ivillage would have slower than expected revenue growth and would incur greater than expected losses  and ivillage s business and financial condition would be harmed 
furthermore  different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet and it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
this makes it difficult to project ivillage s future advertising rates and revenues 
ivillage has a small number of advertisers and the loss of a number of these advertisers could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage depends on a small number of advertisers for a significant portion of its revenues 
in   and  respectively  revenues from ivillage s five largest advertisers accounted for approximately   and of total revenues  however  no one advertiser accounted for greater than of total revenues 
at december   ford motor media accounted for approximately of the net accounts receivable 
at december   no advertiser accounted for greater than of the net accounts receivable 
ivillage anticipates that after the completion of the merger its results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of advertisers 
in addition  ivillage s largest advertisers have in the past varied over time  and ivillage anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
consequently  the loss of even a small number of its largest advertisers at any one time may adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations  unless ivillage is able to enter into a sufficient number of new comparable contracts 
ivillage may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry 
ivillage s market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in ivillage s industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
to achieve its goals  ivillage needs to effectively integrate the various software programs and tools required to enhance and improve its product offerings and manage its business 
ivillage s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of its services 
ivillage may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
in addition  ivillage s new enhancements must meet the requirements of its current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance 
ivillage also could incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructures to adapt to these changes 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to doing business on the internet 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the internet 
however  laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy  pricing and taxation  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust matters and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  the telecommunications act sought to prohibit transmitting various types of information and content over the internet 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies 
this could increase the cost of transmitting data over the internet 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as property ownership  obscenity  libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet or the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to ivillage s business 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect ivillage s business 
in addition  it has been reported that the labor department is investigating the use of volunteers on web sites 
ivillage uses volunteers as web site community leaders and there can be no assurance that new government regulations will not require ivillage to stop using volunteers or  alternatively  treat them as employees 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although ivillage s transmissions over the internet originate primarily in new york  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate ivillage s business activities 
in addition  because ivillage s service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  these jurisdictions may require ivillage to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries  which could subject ivillage to taxes and other regulations 
seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
if ivillage s market makes the transition from an emerging to a more developed market  seasonal and cyclical patterns may develop also in its market  which  if similar to those in traditional media  may result in lower advertising revenues in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
in addition  traffic levels on ivillage s web sites typically fluctuate during the summer and year end vacation and holiday periods 
these seasonal and cyclical patterns may adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage s uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect its business 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is often lengthy  typically six weeks for smaller agreements and longer for larger agreements  and is subject to delays over which ivillage has little or no control  including o advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints  o advertisers and sponsors internal acceptance reviews  o the success and continued internal support of advertisers and sponsors own development efforts  and o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or sponsors 
during the sales cycle  ivillage may expend substantial funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues 
accordingly  ivillage s results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecasted in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
ivillage relies on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of its user base and delivery of advertisements on its web sites 
ivillage s business would be harmed if these third parties fail to provide this service to ivillage 
it is important to ivillage advertisers that ivillage accurately measures the demographics of its user base and the delivery of advertisements on its web site 
ivillage depends on third parties to provide many of these measurement services 
if these third parties are unable or unwilling to provide these services to ivillage in the future  ivillage would need to perform them itself or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause ivillage to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in its business until it replaces these services 
companies may choose to not advertise on ivillage web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive ivillage s demographic measurements are not reliable 
either of these events would adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage relies on third parties to drive traffic to its sites and generate page views  and the business and financial condition of ivillage would be harmed if these third parties were to no longer provide this service 
america online has accounted for a significant portion of ivillage s online traffic based on the delivery to ivillage of a guaranteed number of impressions 
although it is difficult to accurately measure  ivillage believes that america online accounts for in excess of of ivillage s online traffic 
ivillage s agreement with america online does not prohibit america online from carrying online sites or developing and providing content that compete with ivillage s sites  and america online currently carries competing web sites 
although ivillage s agreement with america online expired on december   it is subject to extension by either party for one year and ivillage is currently negotiating a new agreement with america online and  in the interim  ivillage and america online have extended the agreement on a monthly basis 
if america online discontinues carrying ivillage channels  ivillage s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
ivillage may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail to provide reliable software  systems and related services to it 
ivillage is dependent on various third parties for software  systems and related services 
for example  ivillage relies on doubleclick inc s software for the placement of advertisements  trellix corporation for personal space home pages and critical path inc for e mail 
several of the third parties which provide software and services to ivillage have a limited operating history  have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable delivery of services from others 
as a result  ivillage s ability to deliver various services to its users may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services to it 
america online s investments in ivillage competitors may result in conflicts of interest for america online that could be adverse to ivillage 
america online  which has accounted for a significant portion of ivillage s online traffic  has invested in oxygen media  an internet and television company that is developing cable and interactive content for women and children 
in addition  oxygen media has acquired from america online the assets of electra 
com  an online women s network  and thrive partners llc  the operator of thriveonline 
com  a health site 
the relationship between america online and oxygen media and the relationship between america online and ivillage may result in a conflict of interest for america online  which could have an adverse effect on ivillage s relationship with america online  including in the current negotiations of a new agreement with america online or through diversion of attractive business opportunities from america online to another entity rather than ivillage 
other principal investors in ivillage  such as nbc  rho management company  inc and  after the merger  hearst communications  may have similar conflicts of interests by virtue of their other investments 
restrictions on ivillage s ability to enter into sponsorship  advertising or other business relationships with hearst communications competitors  and hearst communications right to license its content to other parties  may both adversely affect ivillage s business 
in connection with the merger  ivillage will assume a magazine content license and hosting agreement originally entered into between women 
com and hearst communications 
under that agreement  ivillage may not  without hearst communications consent o enter into any agreement to include in ivillage s network any web sites for magazines that compete with hearst communications magazines  o display on the magazine web sites any advertising or other promotional materials from magazines that compete with hearst communications magazines  or o display on an ivillage web page the brands  logos  trademarks or proprietary content of both hearst communications and a hearst communications competitor 
these restrictions on ivillage s ability to enter into relationships with hearst communications competitors may prevent ivillage from expanding its network and enhancing its content and the visibility of its brand and may cause it to forego potential advertising revenues from hearst communications competitors 
under the magazine content license and hosting agreement  hearst communications will be permitted to license the content or trademarks of its magazines to any internet site or portal that is not deemed to be an ivillage competitor as defined in the agreement subject only to the limitation that hearst communications may not license content in substantially the same format as it appeared on the ivillage magazine web sites  unless it appeared on the ivillage magazine web sites verbatim to the form initially published by hearst communications  and to use hearst communications content in international editions of its magazines 
as a result of these rights granted to hearst communications  the value to ivillage of the hearst communications content included in the ivillage network could be diluted 
if ivillage fails to manage its growth effectively  its business and financial condition could be harmed 
if ivillage is unable to manage its growth effectively  its business could be adversely affected 
ivillage has experienced and continues to experience significant growth  both internally and through acquisitions and joint ventures 
this growth has placed  and the proposed merger with women 
com and ivillage s anticipated future growth in its operations will continue to place  a significant strain on ivillage s resources 
as part of this growth  ivillage will have to implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
ivillage s business would be harmed if it is unable to implement these new systems in a timely and effective manner 
ivillage may not be able to integrate the operations from future acquisitions and or joint ventures 
as part of ivillage s business strategy  it expects to enter into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures 
the particular risks associated with the women 
com merger are described above 
the risks accompanying other future acquisition and joint venture transactions include  among other things o the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and joint venture entities  o the difficulty of establishing a new joint venture including  without limitation  attracting qualified personnel  potential adverse financial and accounting consequences  high initial expenses  attracting customers and advertisers  and integrating resources from previously unaffiliated entities  o the potential disruption of ivillage s ongoing business  o the inability of ivillage to successfully incorporate acquired or shared technology or content and rights into its products and media properties  o expenses associated with the transactions  o additional expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets  o the difficulty of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  o the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of personnel  and o the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses and joint venture entities 
ivillage s failure to adequately address these issues could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ivillage may not find sufficient acquisition candidates and or joint venture partners to implement its business strategy 
as part of its business strategy  ivillage expects to enter into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures after its acquisition of women 
com 
ivillage competes for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners with other entities  some of which have greater financial resources than it has 
increased competition for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners may make fewer acquisition and or joint venture opportunities available to ivillage and may cause ivillage to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures on less attractive terms  such as higher purchase prices 
acquisition and joint venture costs may increase to levels that are beyond ivillage s financial capability or that would adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
ivillage s ability to make acquisitions will depend  in part  on the relative attractiveness of shares of ivillage common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may depend largely on the relative market price  ivillage s ability to register common stock and capital appreciation prospects of ivillage common stock compared to that of other bidders or potential partners 
since the market price of ivillage common stock has declined materially over a prolonged period of time  its acquisition program could be materially adversely affected 
there is intense competition among internet based businesses and publishing companies focused on women and this competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
the number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers has increased and ivillage expects it to continue to increase 
ivillage s web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies o online services or web sites targeted at women  such as oxygen 
com and condenet 
com  o cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  inc and lifetime television  o web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as america online  inc  terra networks  sa and yahoo inc  o e commerce companies such as amazon 
com  and o publishers and distributors of traditional media  such as television  radio and print 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect ivillage s business  results of operations and financial condition 
lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and aol time warner 
these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ivillage s business would be harmed if its systems fail or experience a slowdown 
substantially all of ivillage s communications hardware and some of its other computer hardware operations are located at exodus communications  inc s facilities in new jersey and verio  inc 
s facilities in california 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss including as a result of rolling blackouts  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
system failures may adversely affect the combined company s user traffic  which could adversely affect its revenues and operating results and harm its reputation with users  advertisers and commerce partners 
computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those historically experienced by several leading web sites  could also adversely affect ivillage s web sites 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt the operation of ivillage s web sites and increase its expenses 
ivillage s insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in its systems 
ivillage does not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
ivillage s web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
ivillage s web sites have in the past experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences have not had a material impact on ivillage s business 
these types of occurrences in the future could cause users to perceive ivillage s web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause them to use another web site or other methods to obtain information 
in addition  ivillage s users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to ivillage s web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to ivillage s systems 
ivillage may incur liability for information it publishes or products it has sold 
ivillage has been and may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information it publishes on its web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against providers of internet services in the past 
in addition  ivillage could be subjected to claims based upon content that is accessible from its web sites through links to other web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards 
in addition  through ivillage 
com  lamaze publishing and ivillage integrated properties  inc  ivillage distributes publications and broadcasts over its web sites and the newborn channel information and advice regarding healthcare  childbirth  infant care and financial and tax issues 
ivillage may be exposed to liability claims in connection with this information 
ivillage also offers e mail services through a third party vendor  which may subject it to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited e mail  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of e mail or interruptions or delays in e mail service 
consumers may also sue ivillage if any of the products that it sold before its recent sale of assets related to its ibaby site  or before its divestiture of its imaternity and plusboutique sites  are found to be defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
ivillage may also face potential liability in connection with the sale of products and services by its e commerce partners 
to date  ivillage has had very limited experience in the sale of products and the development of relationships with manufacturers or suppliers 
ivillage s insurance  which covers commercial general liability  may not adequately protect it against these claims 
liability claims could require ivillage to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages 
as a result  liability claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage ivillage s reputation and business 
ivillage may also be forced to implement expensive measures to alter the way its services are provided to avoid potential liability 
possible infringement by third parties of ivillage intellectual property rights  or claims of intellectual property infringement asserted against ivillage  could harm ivillage s business 
ivillage cannot be certain that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate its proprietary rights 
enforcing ivillage s intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
any infringement or misappropriation by third parties could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s future financial results 
furthermore  ivillage has invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
ivillage cannot guarantee that it will be entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
although ivillage currently believes that its technologies do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  in the future third parties could assert claims of patent  trademark or copyright infringement or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats against ivillage with respect to its use of domain names  its content  web page formats  web business methods or any third party content it carries 
ivillage expects that participants in its markets increasingly will be subject to infringement claims as the number of services and competitors in its industry segment grows 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require ivillage to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent it from using important technologies  ideas or formats  any of which could materially harm ivillage s business  financial condition or results of operations 
ivillage may face potential liability for its privacy practices 
growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject ivillage to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
if ivillage is accused of violating the stated terms of its privacy policy it may be forced to expend significant amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against any of these accusations 
ivillage also may be required to make changes to its present and planned products or services 
these consequences  together with any resulting liability for ivillage s privacy practices  could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage may be liable if third parties misappropriate its users personal information 
if third parties were able to penetrate ivillage s network security or otherwise misappropriate its users personal information or credit card information  ivillage could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
ivillage could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if its privacy practices are investigated 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair ivillage s ability to obtain information about its users  resulting in decreased advertising revenues 
ivillage s network requests and obtains personal data from users who register to become members of the network 
registration as a member is required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by the network 
personal data gathered from members is used to tailor content to them and is provided  on an aggregate basis  to advertisers to assist them in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
the attractiveness of the ivillage network to current or prospective advertisers depends in part on ivillage s ability to provide user data to support this tailoring capability 
however  privacy concerns may cause users to resist providing this personal data 
even the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of ivillage s use of personal data 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user 
other countries and political entities  such as the european economic community  have adopted legislation or regulations containing these notification requirements 
if ivillage becomes unable to collect this personal data from a sufficient number of the users of its network  ivillage may lose significant advertising revenues 
ivillage s network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
information gathered from cookies are used by ivillage to tailor content to users of its network and may also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis 
in addition  advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
germany has imposed laws limiting the use of cookies  and a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
if these laws are passed  it may become more difficult for ivillage to tailor content to its users  making its network less attractive to users 
similarly  the unavailability of cookies may restrict the use of tailored advertising  making ivillage s network less attractive to advertisers and causing ivillage to lose significant advertising revenues
