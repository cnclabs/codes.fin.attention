item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general economic and political conditions  competition  steel pricing and availability  energy prices  and work stoppages by automotive manufacturers 
olympic sells a broad range of products  many of which have different gross margins 
products that have more value added processing generally have a greater gross margin 
accordingly  the company s overall gross margin is affected by product mix and the amount of processing performed  as well as volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs 
the company performs toll processing of customer owned steel  the majority of which is performed by its detroit and georgia operations 
toll processing generally results in lower selling prices and gross margin dollars per ton but higher gross margin percentages than the company s direct sales

the company sells certain products internationally  primarily in mexico and puerto rico 
all international sales and payments are made in united states dollars 
these sales historically involve the company s direct representation of steel producers and may be covered by letters of credit or trade receivable insurance 
typically  international sales are more transactional in nature with lower gross margins than domestic sales 
domestic steel producers generally supply domestic customers before meeting foreign demand  particularly during periods of supply constraints 
because the company conducts its operations generally on the basis of short term orders  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future performance

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuating steel prices 
the company has not entered into interest rate or steel commodity transactions for speculative purposes or otherwise 
inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of personnel  transportation services  processing equipment  purchased steel  energy  and borrowings under the various credit agreements 
in  increasing energy prices did have an adverse effect on the company s distribution and occupancy expense 
rising interest rates also adversely impacted the company s financing costs in additionally  when raw material prices decline  as in  customer demands for lower prices result in lower selling prices and  as the company uses existing steel inventory  lower margins 
declining steel prices therefore adversely affected the company s net sales  gross margins and net income in olympic s primary interest rate risk exposure results from floating rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from december  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from december  levels  the additional annual interest expense to the company would be approximately thousand 
the company currently does not hedge its exposure to floating interest rate risk
