item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  the company continued its strategic plan of becoming a full service integrated communications provider 
it remained focused on growing its core telecommunications businesses by offering new services  such as high speed data dsl service  in the territories of its local exchange telephone companies  and entering new wireless personal communication service pcs markets  such as state college pennsylvania 
in january  it acquired telebeam  inc tbi  a competitive communications company  providing high speed data  long distance voice and cable television  located in state college  pennsylvania 
the acquisition of tbi was accounted for as a pooling of interests  which required the restatement of the company s financial statements for prior years 
consequently  the company s financial results for the years discussed herein have been restated to include the financial results of tbi prior to the acquisition transaction 
tbi and conestoga communications  inc cci provided many duplicative services  so effective december   tbi and cci were merged into one company with the name cei networks  inc cni 
consolidated operating revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
such increases included a increase in the local service revenues of the company s telephone utilities and clec subsidiaries from the provision of local exchange services  due in substantial part to the continued increase in access lines in service  and a increase in the pcs wireless service revenues of cwc  the company s provider of wireless telecommunications services due to the continued expansion of cwc s customer base 
long distance and access revenues decreased in  lead by a decline in cni s long distance service revenues due in substantial part by tbi s pre acquisition sale of certain long distance revenue producing assets 
net income grew to million  or per common share  from net income of million  or per common share 
the increase in net income was directly impacted by a million before tax gain from the sale of investment securities in operating income declined from million in to million in the decline was caused by the impact of the operating expenses of the new businesses of cwc and cni in a very competitive environment  the investment in the infrastructure of cwc s wireless and cni s clec systems  and one time merger costs associated with the acquisition of tbi 
the continued strong operating performance of the companys local networks and related markets provides the company with the financial resources to pursue its strategic plan to become a fully integrated communications provider 
results of operations revenues perating revenues increase in thousands the increase in operating revenues in  resulted from increases in local service and wireless revenues  offset by decreases in access  long distance and equipment revenues 
cni generated million  ctt and bvt together generated million  and cwc generated million in revenues during  compared with million  million  and million  respectively  in local service revenues increase in thousands local service revenues are generated from the provision of local exchange services  including enhanced services  by the companys incumbent local exchange carrier ilec subsidiaries  ctt and bvt  and the company s competitive local exchange carrier clec subsidiary  cni 
enhanced services include caller id  call waiting and return call 
the substantial increase in local service revenues in and reflected the continued growth in access lines in service of the company s ilec and clec subsidiaries 
local service revenues are regulated by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc 
the puc approved a rate re balancing order for the ilec s in the second quarter of this order  while revenue neutral  permitted an increase in local service rates  and resulted in a increase in local service revenues in the number of ctt s  bvt s  and cni s access lines in service has increased substantially in recent years 
during  the number of ctt s and bvt s ilec access lines in service increased  or  to a total of  and cni s clec access lines in service increased by over  or  to a total of  the installation of more than one access line for a residential customer  largely as a result of increasing internet usage  has been a major factor in such increases within the company s franchised territories in recent years 
the company in began offering high speed digital subscriber line service dsl in its franchised territories 
the availability of dsl service could adversely impact the growth of access lines  because a dsl line can carry voice traffic while simultaneously connected to the internet 
of course  dsl s potential adverse impact on the growth of access lines is likely to be at least partially offset by the fact that the company is likely to realize greater revenues from providing dsl service to a residential customer than from providing an additional access line to the same customer 
the company had dsl subscribers as of december   and anticipates this service to grow rapidly 
long distance and access service revenues increase decrease in thousands long distance and access service revenues are generated by the telephone companies and cni

long distance toll service is becoming increasingly competitive 
the puc adopted regulations  effective january   requiring intralata toll competition within the commonwealth of pennsylvania 
the intralata toll revenues of ctt and bvt have declined as a result of such increased competition

a large portion of the telephone companies long distance customers were picked up by cni 
long distance service is very price competitive  and is  therefore  susceptible to customer churn 
in  cni s long distance revenues were million  a decline of from this decline was partially due to tbi s sale of certain lines of business in mid  prior to the merger  and to the rate reduction from the telephone companies

the decline in was due to the fact that was an unusually good year with the sale and installation of several large telephone systems and security systems that year 
the directory advertising revenues of both ctt and bvt  which  in  made up of equipment and other revenues  continue to increase with a increase in billing and collection revenues of both ctt and bvt declined during  primarily as a result of long distance toll competition  whereby other long distance carriers do their own billing

although net income for accounting purposes is decreased by the amortization of the goodwill and the higher depreciation expenses arising from the capital investments in clec and pcs  amortization and depreciation are non cash expenses and  consequently  a source of cash that the company can use for the capital investments necessary to maintain and upgrade its network and build and develop pcs and clec

substantial amounts of additional capital will be needed for the remaining build out of the pcs network and the build out of the clec network 
cwcs capital requirements over the next several years to complete the build out of its entire pcs network and the clec network could exceed million

other factors personal communication services pcs cwc holds personal communication services pcs licenses issued by the federal communications commission to provide wireless telecommunication services 
pcs is a wireless service based on lower power and a higher frequency bandwidth than cellular service 
the basic trading area in which cwc holds c and d blocks licenses are reading  pottsville  sunbury  williamsport and state college  pennsylvania  covering a population of one millon people in ten counties in pennsylvania 
in april cwc was the successful bidder in the federal communications commission c block re auction for additional bandwidth in the basic trading areas bta where the company already held licenses and for bandwidth in the state college bta

cwc plans to put an additional base stations into service during to augment coverage in those markets 
cwc has retail locations in its county operating territory 
the development of the pcs network and business is subject to the risks and delays associated with the design and construction of the wireless system and the commencement of a new business 
the company has already invested almost million in the pcs network and business and could invest an additional million over the next several years 
the company is projecting pcs operating losses for the near future 
the capital cost of the pcs system  the depreciation expense of the pcs assets  and the projected pcs operating losses will significantly impact the company s earnings 
management views participation in pcs as an important part of its future 
pcs is a reliable  convenient and inexpensive vehicle for providing wireless telephone service 
it will provide the company with an opportunity to expand its business into neighboring territories 
effects of substantial indebtedness and preferred stock on future operations at december   the company had approximately million of long term debt outstanding  approximately million of long term capital leases and approximately million of redeemable preferred stock  compared to approximately million of common equity 
this resulted in a ratio of debt and preferred stock to equity 
at december  the ratio was debt to equity 
the increased debt ratio reflects the additional debt acquired during although a higher level of debt and preferred stock is not unusual in the telecommunications industry  the additional debt and preferred stock may have important consequences on the companys future operations  including i the company will incur additional interest expense and significant principal repayment obligations  ii the company is subject to significant unscheduled preferred stock redemption obligations  iii the companys increased leverage may make it more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and iv payment of dividends on the companys common shares may be restricted by the level of financial resources needed to service the companys additional debt and preferred stock 
regulated industry ctt and bvt are both regulated by the pennsylvania public utility commission puc and the federal communications commission fcc 
an amendment to the pennsylvania public utility act passed in  provides for streamlined rate regulation and a method for determining rates other than the historic method of rate of return regulation for the state jurisdiction 
this new regulation referred to as chapter  provides a price stability mechanism in which a telephone companys annual revenues from non competitive services may be permitted to change in line with the gross domestic product price index  minus a productivity offset  with no limitation on earnings by the regulated company 
in order for the company to avail itself of the procedures permitted by chapter  ctt and bvt must commit to providing universal broadband services by both companies filed chapter plans in july and approval was received in january the interstate jurisdiction remains subject to rate of return regulation 
the telecommunication industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on financial performance 
the federal telecommunications act of  creates a regulatory environment that encourages competition 
as rural companies  ctt and bvt are exempt from many of the most onerous aspects of competition unless prospective competitors can pass a public interest standard and agree to offer service throughout the telephone companies territories 
in addition  in march ctt and bvt received approval by the pennsylvania puc of a petition that has significantly strengthened the companies competitive position relative to non facilities based competition 
however  facilities based competition is not precluded 
management believes that competition will continue to bring many new opportunities for our competitive businesses 
management is endeavoring to position the company to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise and remains optimistic about the future 
during cni grew its long distance business both in the ctt and bvt franchise territories  as well a surrounding areas 
in addition the company s competitive local telephone business became operational in and began offering service in bell atlantics franchise territory 
strong growth in this business segment was experienced in as a result of the addition of the state college  pennsylvania territory 
strong growth is expected to continue in accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas the company follows the accounting statement which recognizes the economic effect of rate regulation by recording costs and return on investment as such amounts are recovered through regulatory authorized rates 
as of december   the company had no regulated assets but had regulated liabilities totaling thousand 
the company currently expects to follow the accounting practices prescribed by sfas in the foreseeable future  but  if the company discontinued this practice  the effect of writing off any regulatory assets and liabilities would not be material to the companys operations 
effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating revenues and expenses over the past three years have been immaterial 
management anticipates that this trend will continue in the near future
