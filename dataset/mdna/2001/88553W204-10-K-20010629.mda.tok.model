overview we are a leading developer and publisher of branded interactive entertainment software 
our software products operate on several multimedia platforms including the sony playstation and nintendo video game consoles  playstation computer entertainment system  the nintendo game boy color hand held video game system and on personal computers and the internet 
we are also developing software for next generation video game consoles 
we plan to continue to extend our popular brands across multiple categories  or genres  and platforms 
these brands currently include army men  heroes  high heat baseball  might and magic  and world destruction league  many of which have won industry awards 
our software products cover a variety of genres  including action  strategy  adventure role playing  sports and family entertainment 
we develop the majority of our software internally in our company owned studios and have created an extensive portfolio of versatile technologies that we believe allow us to develop new software titles more quickly and cost effectively than our competition 
periodically we utilize external developers and contractors who possess specific skills to supplement our internal development efforts when management deems it cost effective 
revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of software titles published and distributed by us and license fees for software developed by us and manufactured  marketed and distributed by third party licensees in europe  latin america  asia and australia 
software publishing revenues are net of allowances for returns  price protection and discounts 
software publishing revenues are recognized at the time of receipt of our goods by our customers based on the agreed upon shipping terms  provided that we have no related outstanding obligations 
software licensing revenues are typically recognized when we fulfill our obligations  such as delivery of the product master under a licensing agreement 
per copy royalties that exceed guaranteed minimum royalty levels are recognized upon cash receipt 
prior to fiscal year  our revenue policy was to recognize revenue at the time our products were shipped to our customers 
we changed our revenue recognition policy during fiscal year  based on guidelines provided in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we now recognize revenue at the point products are received by our customers 
we estimate that our products typically take on average  three days from the point of shipment to their arrival at our customers sites 
cost of revenues consist primarily of direct costs associated with software titles  including manufacturing costs and royalties payable to platform developers such as sony and nintendo and  to a lesser extent  royalties payable to third party developers and licensors 
cost of revenues for interactive entertainment software varies significantly by platform 
cost of revenues for video game console titles is typically higher than cost of revenues for personal computer titles due to relatively higher manufacturing and royalty costs associated with these products 
cost of revenues for personal computer titles primarily consists of the cost of the cd rom and packaging 
research and development expenses relate to the development of new products and consist primarily of direct and indirect salaries and wages of software research and development personnel  direct research and development expenses  and amounts paid to outside developers 
software development costs that are not capitalized are expensed as incurred 
capitalization of internal software development costs begins upon establishment of technological feasibility and ceases when the product is available for general release to customers 
technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detailed program design  or in its absence  a working model of the product 
historically  the establishment of technological feasibility for internal development projects has substantially coincided with general release of the products and we have not capitalized any software development costs on internal development projects  as the eligible costs were determined to be insignificant 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we capitalized internal development costs of approximately million for second generation games for a new platform due to significant costs being incurred after technological feasibility was reached 
external development costs are capitalized once technological feasibility is established or if the development costs have an alternative future use 
the criteria for establishing technological feasibility for external development projects is consistent with that used for internal development projects noted above 
in the current fiscal year  we began utilizing external developers to translate existing products to alternate platforms and to localize existing products into various foreign languages 
technological feasibility of the translated and localized products was established by existing products and as a result we capitalized approximately million of external development costs during fiscal amortization of capitalized software costs is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the related products or the amount computed using the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  whichever is greater  and is included in cost of revenues 
during the year ended march   we amortized million of capitalized software development costs 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and retail marketing support  sales commissions  sales and marketing personnel costs and other costs 
general and administration expenses consist primarily of administrative expenses related to finance  accounting  legal  operations  information technology  customer service and other associated costs 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop our business in the future 
we expect that our operating results will fluctuate as a result of a wide variety of factors  including the factors described in risk factors 
as of march   we had cumulative federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
if not offset against future taxable income  these net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in fiscal and  for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
as of march   we had unused research and development tax credits of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and california income taxes  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credits begin expiring in fiscal the california research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we also had foreign tax credits of approximately million available to reduce future federal income taxes  expiring through fiscal there are also minimum tax credits of approximately million available to reduce future federal income taxes  which will carry forward indefinitely 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal  and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense associated with convertible debt interest and other income  net income loss before taxes fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the average selling price per unit due to increased competition in a platform transition year 
our revenues consisted primarily of sales of interactive entertainment software for the playstation game console  the playstation computer entertainment system  game boy color  the nintendo and the personal computer 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this small decrease was primarily due to an increase in units sold during the year offset by a shift in product mix 
the amortization of capitalized software costs contributed an increase in cost of revenues of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was due to lower price points in fiscal as pricing became more competitive during the platform transition 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher on going development expenses as we continued to expand our product development efforts and began to develop products for the next generation video game console systems in addition to the current video game platforms 
this increase was partially offset by capitalized external development costs related to localization and platform translation costs after individual titles reached technical feasibility 
these capitalized costs were approximately million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized development costs is charged to cost of revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased advertising of new products  marketing expenses related to increased personnel  offset by lower marketing development funds for retailers 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in bad debt expense combined with an increase in administrative and overhead expenses as we continued to build the infrastructure to support the release of new titles 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the future 
restructuring charge 
during fiscal  we recorded million in restructuring charges 
these charges included a reduction in force of employees for million  and realized and anticipated costs of million for a vacated portion of our headquarters 
we estimate that it will take approximately six months to find a suitable sub lessee for the vacated office space 
as of march  we have accrued million for anticipated costs associated with finding a sub lessee 
net interest and other income 
net interest and other income  excluding interest expense associated with a warrant issuance and convertible debt  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in cash and short term investment balances 
on august  we entered into a convertible note and warrant purchase agreement the agreement with our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  william m 
trip hawkins iii 
under the agreement  mr 
hawkins committed to lend us up to million through september  in consideration for such commitment  we issued to mr 
hawkins a fully exercisable warrant to purchase  shares of common stock for per share 
the warrants have a five year term 
using the black scholes valuation model  we estimated the fair value of the warrants at per share and expensed the resultant million debt discount over the life of the promissory notes 
the accounting conversion price for the million of debt  based on the value assigned to the debt and the number of common shares the debt converts into  was 
accordingly  we recorded a beneficial conversion charge of million based on the intrinsic spread between the accounting conversion price and the market price of our common stock on august   multiplied by the number of common shares involved in the debt conversion 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of new titles released to new titles in fiscal from new titles in fiscal our revenues consisted primarily of sales of interactive entertainment software for the sony playstation  the nintendo and the personal computer 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increased number of software titles published in fiscal compared with fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was due to higher console product mix in fiscal  which had higher per unit cost of goods sold 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher on going development expenses as we continued to expand our product development efforts and began to develop products for the next generation video game console systems in addition to the current video game platforms 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to marketing expenses related to the increase in the number of titles released during fiscal over and the associated launch costs and advertising of the releases 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in administrative and overhead expenses as we continued to build the infrastructure to support the release of new titles for the personal computer  sony playstation  nintendo color game boy  nintendo and the next generation console platforms 
net interest and other income 
net interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in cash and short term investment balances 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balances  which were million at march  and million at march  the decrease was primarily due to the million cash used in operating activities and million in capital expenditures offset by cash provided by financing activities of million 
in april  we terminated the coast business credit revolving line of credit agreement 
concurrently  we entered into a million revolving line of credit with foothill capital 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that our borrowing requirements were less than the previously negotiated million line of credit 
accordingly  on december   we signed an amendment to the foothill capital line of credit agreement  which effectively reduced the borrowing capacity by million 
the foothill capital credit facility now allows us to borrow up to million  or of qualified accounts receivables  bearing an interest rate of prime rate plus to per annum as of march  depending on our tangible net worth and will expire on march  interest expense is due monthly and the loan balance is due at the expiration date of the credit agreement 
this agreement contains certain financial covenants  including the requirement that we maintain tangible net worth of not less than million 
in august  we sold two convertible promissory notes totaling million to our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  william m 
trip hawkins iii 
associated with the issuance of the promissory notes  we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share to mr 
hawkins 
the notes were convertible to shares of common stock at a price of per share 
in september  the notes and accrued interest were converted to  shares of common stock 
during the year ended march   we recognized interest expense of million associated with the issuance of warrants and million associated with convertible debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  we sold  shares of common stock at the stock s closing price on october  of per share 
as part of the transaction we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
mr 
hawkins purchased  of these shares and was issued  of the warrants on terms equivalent with the third party purchaser 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy our projected working capital requirements through the fall of  at which time we may need to raise additional capital 
our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity through fall of is particularly dependent on us achieving our projected sales forecasts for the period and the continued availability of our line of credit with foothill capital corporation 
if we need to raise additional capital  such capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
additional financing may result in substantial and immediate dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to seek funds through arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish material rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  or we may become insolvent 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no  will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities  municipal bonds  time deposits and certificates of deposit 
we classify our cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily include money market accounts held at various securities brokers and banks 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our investment portfolio at march  short term investments average cost fair value interest rate in thousands in thousands fixed rate   the aggregate fair value of the our restricted cash included in our investment portfolio as of march   by contractual maturity date  consisted of the following aggregate fair value in thousands due in one year or less
