item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  but does not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
principal exposed to interest rate risk at december   is million in variable rate debt exclusive of amounts covered by interest rate swap agreements 
the company measures its interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which potential future net earnings would be impacted by hypothetical changes in market interest rates related to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of december   the estimated reduction in earnings  net of tax  is expected to be approximately million 
the company periodically utilizes foreign exchange contracts to minimize its exposure to currency risk for the payment of its interest obligations on non us dollar denominated debt 
foreign currency payments are received periodically from its foreign subsidiaries to permit repayment of non us dollar denominated debt owed by the parent company 
upon receipt  forward contracts are purchased as a hedge against exchange rate fluctuations that may occur between the receipt date and the interest payment due date 
the company mitigates its foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities in the markets it serves and by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products 
the company also monitors its foreign currency exposure in each country and implements strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates primarily to us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
the company s exposure related to such transactions is not material to cash flows 
however  exposure to the company s financial position and results of operations related to such transactions is anticipated to be adversely impacted by approximately  net of tax  for every devaluation of the brazilian real per us dollar and up to  net of tax  for every depreciation of the euro and its fixed legacy currencies arising from multiple intercompany loans among the company and its european subsidiaries 
these amounts are estimates only and are difficult to accurately project due to factors such as the inherent fluctuation of intercompany account balances and the existing economic uncertainty and unpredictable future economic conditions in the international marketplace
