item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we reported net income of million for the year  a increase over our reported net income for of million 
our increase in profitability primarily resulted from a or million increase in our revenues and an increase in our operating margin  before restructuring credits and charges relating to acquisitions  from to 
the benefit from these two items was offset by an increase of million in amortization and write off charges relating to acquired intangibles primarily arising from our acquisition of hfn and a million decrease in restructuring credits 
our revenue growth during the year was due to strong performances in both our core technologies and services  and our growth initiatives in enterprise portals  wireless computing  and the financial services vertical 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments  and stockholders equity of million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  we are organized into five separate business segments  each focused upon one of five key market segments enterprise solutions esd  ianywhere solutions  inc ias  formerly our mobile and embedded computing mec division  internet applications iad  business intelligence bid  and financial fusion  inc ffi 
for a discussion of each of these business segments  see business  part i  item  incorporated here by reference 
with our focus on enterprise portals  wireless computing and vertical solutions we believe we are in a strong position to succeed in very competitive markets 
we believe that these initiatives along with our strong customer base  market focused segment structure  and sound financial position allow for continued financial stability and earnings growth 
results of operations revenues dollars in millions change change license fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues total revenues total revenues for increased percent over total revenues increased slightly compared to total revenues 
the increase in from was due to strong license revenue growth in our core enterprise software  wireless  and e finance products  and growth in both our maintenance and professional services revenues 
license fees revenues increased percent over license fee revenues 
license fees revenues remained flat in when compared to in  the increase in license fees revenues was primarily due to increased sales in certain product lines included in the esd and mec divisions and the revenues from our ffi subsidiary  newly added in in  license fees revenues from sales of certain product lines included in the mec and bid divisions increased but were offset by sales decreases in certain product lines included in the esd and iad divisions 
services revenues grew percent in compared to services revenues in services revenues grew percent between and the increase in services revenues during was attributable to a percent increase in revenue from support and maintenance fees and an percent increase in professional services  education and consulting revenues 
the increase in support and maintenance revenues was primarily due to an increase in our installed base 
the increase in professional services revenues primarily related to the professional services of ffi  which was formed in after our acquisition of hfn 
the increase between and was primarily attributable to increased support and maintenance fees revenues from directly supported sites  additional users  and the renewal of maintenance contracts services revenues are derived primarily from consulting  education and technical support services relating to our products

increases in both support and maintenance revenues  and professional services revenues contributed to the overall increase in services revenue 
north america revenues increased percent between and  largely due to license fees revenues growth in certain product lines included in the esd  mec and bid divisions  and partially offset by a decrease in revenues associated with certain product lines included in the iad division 
international revenues increased percent in over  after decreasing percent in compared to european revenues increased percent in primarily due to increased license fee revenues in certain product lines  including esd and ias products  as well as license revenues from ffi 
european revenues declined percent from to due to a decline in revenues from certain product lines included in the esd  mec and iad divisions  partially offset by increased revenues from certain product lines included in the bid division 
management changes in europe also adversely affected revenues in see future operating results international operations and human resources below for a further discussion of management changes 
in  intercontinental revenues principally asia pacific and south america increased percent due to increased license fees revenues in certain product lines included in the esd division along with an increase in support and maintenance revenues 
in  intercontinental revenues decreased percent from the revenues total due to a decline in the revenues generated by certain product lines included in the esd division 
international revenues comprised percent of total revenues in and  down from percent in in europe and the intercontinental region  most revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues was not material in   or although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the future

percentage of total revenues not meaningful cost of license fees cost of license fees consists primarily of product costs media and documentation  amortization of capitalized software development costs and third party royalty costs 
in  these costs decreased percent from the cost of license fees expense increased percent in over the decrease in cost of license fees was primarily due to decreased third party royalties which were partially offset by increases in amortization of capitalized software costs and the amortization of purchased technology acquired in the hfn transaction 
the increase was primarily due to increased third party royalties 
cost of license fees was percent of license fees revenues in  percent in and percent in amortization of capitalized software costs was million in  million in and million in in  the increase in amortization of capitalized software costs was primarily related to adaptive server enterprise  powerbuilder  jaguar cts and  and sybase enterprise portal amortization costs remained relatively flat from to cost of services cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and education expenses and  to a lesser degree  services related product costs media and documentation 
these costs increased percent during and decreased percent between and these costs increased as a percentage of services revenues to percent in  compared to percent in  and were percent of services revenues in the increase in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in over was primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting personnel located in north america partially attributable to the acquisition of hfn  and market driven increases in the labor costs associated with consulting personnel 
the decrease  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in over  was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and facility costs including rent and depreciation as a result of the restructuring program initiated in sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased percent during compared to and decreased percent from to sales and marketing expenses remained consistent at percent of total revenues in and  as compared to percent in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily due to sales expenses associated with increased revenues including the addition of ffi  and certain marketing programs undertaken during the year 
the increase in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a decrease in allocated common costs 
we allocate various common costs including certain legal expenses  accounting  human resources  external consulting  employee benefits  and facilities costs to sales and marketing  product development and engineering  and general and administrative expenses 
the common costs in were higher than those in due to certain litigation costs during  the costs associated with internal yk compliance  and the streamlining of certain back office functions during the decrease in sales and marketing expense  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in salary cost  facility costs including rent  and depreciation as a result of the restructuring plan initiated in the decrease in was partially offset by an increase in allocated common costs primarily pertaining to litigation costs

the decrease in product development and engineering expenses  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in personnel expenses and allocated common costs 
the decrease in was primarily due to an increase in software development costs capitalized during the year  and a decrease in salary cost  facility costs including rent  and depreciation as a result of the restructuring plan initiated in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in allocated common costs 
we capitalize product development and engineering costs during the period between achievement of technological feasibility and general availability of the product 
amounts capitalized totaled approximately million in  million in and million in in  capitalized software costs included costs incurred for the development of the sybase enterprise portal  adaptive server enterprise  adaptive server iq and  directconnect and  enterprise application server  and mainframeconnect tm and in  capitalized software costs included costs incurred for the development of adaptive server enterprise  enterprise event broker  sybase financial server tm  enterprise application studio  powerj  replication server  and powerdesigner during  we capitalized software costs in connection with our acquisition of intellidex  development of adaptive server enterprise  and enhancements to replication server and jaguar cts 
we believe that product development and engineering expenditures are essential to technology and product leadership and expect product development and engineering expenditures to continue to be significant  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased percent in compared to in  the costs increased percent from general and administrative expenses represented percent of total revenues in compared to percent in both and the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in allocated common costs which were partially offset by the costs associated with ffi 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared to was primarily due to an increase in allocated common costs 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles increased percent during compared to in  the costs decreased percent from these costs were percent of total revenues in compared to percent in both and the increase in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in absolute dollars in compared to and is attributable to amortization of goodwill and the established customer list associated with the hfn acquisition 
the decrease in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles between and was due to certain intangibles that became fully amortized during early in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of hfn in the quarter ended march   we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
as part of the process of analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than to develop the technology internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of time and costs it would take to bring the technology to market 
hfn had been involved in the development of technologies that enable financial institutions to deliver their services to customers via the internet 
at the acquisition date  hfn was conducting development and qualification activities related to a suite of products encompassing bill presentment  small business functions  alternate service delivery methods and related underlying software technology 
at that time  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value allocated to these projects was immediately expensed at the date of acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the in process research and development by determining the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates 
the selection of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted to reflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances known at the time  and each technologies degree of completion 
projected future net cash flows attributable to hfn s in process research and development  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using a discount rate of percent 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
the analysis of the in process technology was determined by incorporating the revenue related to the expected evolution of the technology over time 
once developed  the estimated lifecycle of the product suite was estimated to be approximately to years 
as a whole  hfn is expected to exhibit compound annual growth of approximately percent in the period from through it was projected that the suite of products resulting from the in process research and development efforts would begin generating revenue in and positive cash flow in operating expenses included selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
total research and development was divided into i the costs to complete the in process research and development projects and ii costs for developed products that had already been introduced to the market  including product maintenance 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by management 
these costs were allocated based on an analysis of expected project completion dates 
the resultant target margin that hfn expected to achieve from the in process products was approximately percent 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first several years of the product suite s lifecycle compared to the latter years due to a higher level of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the earlier years 
the financial forecasts only included results that were projected to be generated by hfn on a standalone basis 
synergies resulting from the combination of sybase were not incorporated into the analysis 
to properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been accomplished to date and exclude the effort to be completed on the development efforts underway  it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated with the research and development projects to reflect only the accomplishments made as of the date of the acquisition towards the ultimate completion of the in process r d projects 
the relative contribution made on the research and development efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including absolute development time costs incurred to date  management estimates  and a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks required to complete the efforts and the associated risks 
overall  hfn s in process research and development projects were estimated to be approximately percent complete 
hfn estimated that the projects would be completed in march  after which time it expected to begin generating economic benefits from the completed projects 
as of the valuation date  approximately man months totaling  had been expended on the in process research and development projects 
in total  costs to complete hfn s in process research and development were expected to be approximately  and require man months of work 
completion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn a new to the world software suite into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
historically  many of hfn s in process research and development projects have required rework and additional expenditures in comparable stages of development 
the research and development efforts described above are substantially complete and actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisition 
cost reversal of restructuring in february  we announced and began to implement a restructuring plan the plan aimed at improving productivity per employee  including reductions in sales and marketing  and product development and engineering expenses 
our goal was to significantly reduce annual operating expenses by realigning resources around our core product initiatives 
the plan included estimated restructuring charges of million to be incurred in the plan included the termination of at least  employees  the termination of certain product lines  and the consolidation or closure of certain facilities and subsidiaries 
as a result of the plan  we terminated approximately  employees  consolidated or closed more than facilities worldwide  abandoned certain property  equipment and improvements principally leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software  wrote off costs of terminating certain product lines  and closed down subsidiaries in mexico  thailand  chile  peru and venezuela 
in the first phase of the restructuring  we focused our efforts on eliminating product lines not core to the business 
we also reduced personnel and related facilities costs to achieve an immediate reduction in our cost structure 
in the fourth quarter of  we focused our restructuring efforts on reducing costs  and realigning our sales force  product teams and professional service capabilities into four new divisions 
the charges included reductions of personnel and related facilities costs 
the amounts included in the restructuring charges for were as follows dollars in thousands q q total termination payments to employees and other related costs    lease cancellations and commitments    write downs of property  plant and equipment   capitalized software   prepaid royalties   other   costs related to closing of subsidiaries  including write off of goodwill    estimated product and employee termination liabilities    other   termination payments to employees and other related costs in the first quarter of  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million for severance payments and termination benefits in connection with the termination of approximately employees 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred additional restructuring charges of approximately million for severance payments and termination benefits paid in connection with the additional termination of approximately employees 
the severance payments and termination benefits were accrued and charged to restructuring costs in the period that both the benefit amounts were determined and such amounts were communicated to the affected employees 
lease cancellation and commitments in the first quarter of  we incurred restructuring charges of million for facilities consolidated or closed in burlington  massachusetts  mexico and japan 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a restructuring charge of million for facilities consolidated or closed  including sales offices in the united states  europe and asia 
these offices were primarily responsible for the sale of our software products  professional services and customer support 
these restructuring charges reflect the remaining contractual obligations under facility leases net of anticipated sublease income from the date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
certain facilities described above continued in use during the completion of the restructuring 
we continued to record monthly rent expense on these facilities as an operating expense until the facilities were abandoned 
write downs of property  plant and equipment in the first and fourth quarters of  we incurred restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  related to the carrying values of property  equipment and leaseholds abandoned in connection with the restructuring 
the specific assets charged to restructure included personal computers and equipment used by employees terminated  office equipment and leaseholds in connection with closure or consolidation of facilities and subsidiaries in the united states  asia including japan and latin america  and  certain internal use software abandoned in connection with the restructuring 
the assets were all taken out of service and held for disposal at the date that they were identified for inclusion in the restructure  except for the assets of the japanese subsidiary that remained in use for three months 
the assets of the japanese subsidiary were depreciated for the three months they remained in use 
write downs of capitalized software prepaid royalties in the first quarter of  we incurred restructuring charges of million related to the carrying value of capitalized software development costs for those product lines which we had eliminated as part of the plan 
the products eliminated included sybase mpp tm on certain platforms  certain apt products  dbqueue tm  web 
sql tm  lego rom and powerbuilder r for mac 
in the first quarter of  we also incurred restructuring charges of million related to the carrying value of prepaid royalties paid by us to third party licensors 
these prepaid royalties related to technologies either embedded in abandoned products or technologies abandoned because they were no longer core to our business 
costs related to closing of subsidiaries  including write off of goodwill in the first quarter of  we accrued approximately million for costs associated with the closure of certain subsidiaries 
of this amount  approximately million represented costs associated with the closure of our mexican subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million associated with the closing of subsidiaries consisting principally of the write off of goodwill related to our subsidiary in chile 
the fourth quarter charge was partially offset by the recovery of million of certain accounts receivable of the mexican subsidiary previously charged to restructuring costs in the first quarter of estimated product and employee termination liabilities in the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million associated with anticipated liabilities for claims resulting from the abandonment of products no longer core to our business and from the termination of employees 
the amounts accrued were based on our previous experience with obligations associated with end of life products and employee terminations  including payments made in connection with the restructuring in in the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated this liability and based on actual claims received  amounts paid to date and legal counsel s estimate of future obligations to customers and employees  we reduced the liability by approximately million 
during  we reversed by credit to operating expenses million of restructuring costs related to the plan 
the reversals included million related to termination payments to employees and other related costs  million related to lease cancellations and commitments  and  million of legal and other fees 
during  we reversed by credit to operating expenses million of restructuring costs related to the plan 
the reversals consisted primarily of lease cancellations and commitments and other costs 
the following tables summarize the activity related to the restructuring liability at december  and dollars in thousands accrued accrued liabilities amounts amounts amounts liabilities at written off paid reversed at termination payments to employees and other related costs    lease cancellations and commitments     costs related to closing of subsidiaries  including write off of goodwill   other   accrued accrued liabilities amounts amounts liabilities at paid reversed at termination payments to employees and other related costs lease cancellations and commitments  other the remaining restructuring reserve relates to certain lease payments contractually required of us on certain closed facilities  net of associated sublease amounts 
the remaining lease amounts will be paid during operating income loss dollars in millions change change operating income loss percentage of total revenues not meaningful operating income in increased percent over we had a significant loss in in and  operating income included a reversal to restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  while the operating loss includes million in restructuring charges 
the increase in operating income in  compared to  is primarily due to an increase in total revenues  and the continued benefit from the restructure actions taken in that have kept sales and marketing  product development and engineering  and general and administrative expenses equal to or lower than the levels obtained  as a percentage of revenue 
the increase was partially offset by an increase in cost of services and expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and established customer lists  the write off of in process research and development and the amortization of purchased technology relating to the acquisition of hfn 
the million increase in operating income in  compared to  primarily resulted from lower operating expenses ensuing from the plan  and the absence of the restructuring charge 
other income expense  net dollars in millions change change interest income percentage of total revenues interest expense and other  net percentage of total revenues minority interest percentage of total revenues not meaningful interest income increased percent from to in  interest income increased percent from interest income consists primarily of interest earned on investments 
the increase between and was attributable to larger average invested cash balances  and an increase in the interest rate yields of the cash balances invested 
the increase in interest income between and due primarily to the build up of larger average invested cash balances 
interest expense and other  net was million in  compared to million in and million in interest expense and other  net includes interest expense from capital lease obligations incurred in prior years  gains from the disposition of certain real estate and investments  bank fees  expenses  net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and the related hedging activities  and the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures 
the decrease in interest expense and other  net during compared to  was due to the sale of certain european real estate 
provision for income taxes dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes in  income taxes were recorded at a rate of percent on pre tax income compared to a percent rate in in we recorded income taxes of million  primarily related to withholding taxes  and income taxes in those foreign jurisdictions where we had income 
the and tax provisions were the result of taxable earnings generated from operations in both the us and certain international jurisdictions 
the provision benefited from a million reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance reversed related to certain research and development tax credits that we believe will generate a tax benefit in future periods given their carryforward periods 
the reversal of the valuation allowance is a non recurring benefit  and will not impact our provision for income taxes in future years 
the benefit of the valuation allowance reversal was offset somewhat in by an increase in expenses that were not deductible for tax purposes 
these expenses were primarily the amortization of goodwill and established customer lists  the write off of in process research and development and the amortization of purchased technology relating to the acquisition of hfn 
we had a deferred tax asset of million at december  this deferred tax asset included a valuation allowance of million 
as of december   the deferred tax asset included research and development tax credits of million and foreign tax credits of million 
the research and development tax credits expire in years from through  and the foreign tax credits expire in years from through in order to realize the net deferred tax assets we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions so that we can obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
any such adjustments could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 
net income loss per share dollars and shares in millions change change net income loss percentage of total revenues basic net income loss per share shares used in computing basic net income loss per share diluted net income loss per share shares used in computing diluted net income loss per share not meaningful our net income in increased by percent over the reasons for this increase have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs 
the basic and diluted net income per share in was and per share  respectively 
the basic and diluted net income per share in was and per share  respectively 
the basic and diluted net loss per share was in shares used in computing basic net income loss per share increased percent in primarily due to the shares issued in in connection with the acquisition of hfn 
shares used in computing basic net income loss per share increased percent in primarily due to the exercise of employee stock options and the increase of shares outstanding under the employee stock purchase plan 
shares used in computing diluted net income loss per share increased percent in primarily due to the shares issued in connection with the acquisition of hfn 
shares used in computing diluted net income loss per share increased percent in compared to  primarily due to the effect of outstanding stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share in  as their inclusion would be antidilutive 
liquidity and capital resources dollars in millions change change working capital cash  cash equivalents and cash investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities our working capital increased percent in over  and percent in compared to the increases in both and were primarily due to increased cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased percent from the cash provided by operating activities in net cash provided by operating activities during reflects net income of million compared to million in and net loss of million in the decrease between net cash provided by operating activities in and was primarily due to the increase in accounts receivables and deferred revenue balances at compared to days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the same period in the accounts receivable increased due to both an overall increase in revenues and a decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the increase in deferred revenue was related both to the increase in overall revenues and an increase in deferred support and maintenance fees revenues in connection with directly supported sites  additional users  and the continuing renewal of maintenance contracts 
the impact of these increased balances on cash provided by operating activities was offset by a million increase in depreciation and amortization  which are included in net income loss  but do not require the use of cash 
the increase in depreciation and amortization in was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles in connection with the hfn acquisition  excluding the write off of in process research and development for hfn that resulted in a non cash charge of million in the first quarter of net cash provided by operating activities increased percent between and the primary reason for the increase was a million increase in year over year net income as we returned to profitability  partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization in was primarily due to the write off of assets in connection with the restructuring plan 
we also incurred a non cash restructuring charge to operations in the amount of million in net cash used for investing activities increased percent between and this increase was primarily attributable to million used for business combinations  namely our acquisition of hfn  the use of million to purchase minority equity investments in five early stage e business companies and a million security deposit on a year non cancelable lease of a new facility to be built in dublin  california 
this increase was partially offset by a million year over year decrease in cash investments 
net cash used for investing activities increased percent from to the primary reason for this increase were the cash investments of million we made during  compared to the liquidation of million in cash investments during in  we sold our facility in concord  massachusetts and simultaneously entered into a sales leaseback agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  we entered into a seven year operating lease 
the sales price of million resulted in a book gain of million  which will be amortized over the seven year lease period 
in  we terminated a five year lease for our research and development facility in boulder  colorado by exercising the option to purchase the property for million 
as a result  we satisfied our obligation to the lessor resulting in the release of million in restricted cash deposits 
we subsequently entered into a sale leaseback agreement for the facility  which resulted in an immaterial gain 
under the terms of the leaseback agreement  we entered into a twelve year operating lease the year over year increase in net cash used for financing activities between and was million  compared to a year over year million decrease between and the increase over was primarily the result of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
in  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock through open market transactions from time to time  subject to price and market conditions 
during  an additional million was authorized under this program  and in an additional million was authorized bringing the aggregate total amount authorized to million 
under this program  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in at a cost of million  million shares in at a cost of million and million shares in at a cost of million 
net cash used for financing activities in was primarily related to the repayment of amounts received from japanese financial institutions in prior years for financing transactions related to sales arrangements in our japanese subsidiary 
we were obligated to make approximately million of repayments because of undisclosed side arrangements between the japanese subsidiary and certain customers that made such customers payment obligations conditional 
these side arrangements were not disclosed by certain employees of our japanese subsidiary to the financial institutions upon the sale of the receivables 
as a result  upon the discovery of such side arrangements  we determined that we could not enforce the non recourse provisions under the terms of the factoring contracts 
we engage in global business operations and are therefore exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had identifiable assets totaling million associated with our european operations and million associated with our asia and latin american operations 
we experience foreign exchange transaction exposure on our net assets denominated in different currencies 
as certain of these assets are considered by sybase inc  the us parent company  to be a permanent investment in the respective subsidiaries  the related foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
we also experience foreign exchange translation exposure from certain balances denominated in the non functional currency of the originating entity 
we hedge certain of these short term exposures under a plan approved by the board of directors 
see md a financial risk management  part ii  item cash  cash equivalents and cash investments totaled million at december  compared to million at december   compared to million at december  we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december  we believe that we have the financial resources needed for the foreseeable future to meet our presently anticipated business requirements  including capital expenditures and strategic operating programs

financial risk management foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations

we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and cash investments as all of these investments are at fixed interest rates 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
amounts in thousands except interest rates weighted average interest principal principal rate amounts amounts cash equivalents   short term cash investments maturities of one year or less   long term cash investments maturities over one year   future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a variety of significant risks  some of which are discussed in this report on form k 
we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report 
stock price volatility our ability to exceed  or its failure to achieve  expected operating results for any period could significantly impact our stock price 
inevitably  some investors will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the timing of their investment 
the market for our stock and for technology stocks in general is highly volatile  and the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely during the past years 
the stock price may continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors  including our financial results  press and industry analyst reports  market acceptance of our products and pricing policies  activities of competitors  and other events 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have categorically affected the market price for high technology companies  but which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
revenue related factors the timing and amount of our revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
in our experience  license fees revenues tend to decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year 
this has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the prior fourth quarter 
we currently anticipate that this seasonal pattern will continue 
since we operate with little or no backlog  quarterly revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded to of our quarterly revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks of that month 
our customers include many large enterprises that make substantial investments in our products and services 
therefore  the inability to record one or more large orders from a customer at the very end of a quarter could materially and adversely impact our results or operations 
our operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could impact operating results  causing an operating loss for that period  as occurred in the first quarter of in north america  we currently ship most of our products from our california and massachusetts distribution facilities 
because we tend to record a high percentage of revenues during the last two weeks of each quarter  disruption of operations at either facility at that time due to natural calamity or systems failure  for example could directly harm our ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 
competition the market for our products and services is fast paced and extremely competitive  and is marked by dynamic customer demands  short product life cycles  and the rapid emergence of the e business marketplace 
we have numerous competitors  including large companies such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation  and ibm corporation  and smaller highly aggressive firms 
many of these companies may have greater financial  technical  sales  and marketing resources  and a larger installed base than sybase 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could adversely influence customer perception of our products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  we must be able to develop new products  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies in a timely manner 
our failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business  and on the market price of our stock 
product development increasing widespread use of the internet may significantly alter how we do business in the future 
this  in turn  could affect our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services at competitive prices 
in march  we began shipping the latest version of sybase enterprise portal  the industry s first enterprise class portal product designed to enable organizations to provide personalized business interfaces to employees  customers  partners and suppliers 
in may  the latest versions of replication server  enterpriseconnect and mainframeconnect  our data movement and data access products designed to operate with the enterprise portal technology  also became generally available 
sybase enterprise portal solutions are intended to enable successful e business strategies for organizations transacting business via the internet 
as a general matter  deployment of enterprise portals has increased dramatically in recent years  and we believe that increasing demand for enterprise portal solutions will enhance our revenues and profitability 
however  if the market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or if our enterprise portal solutions and services do not successfully compete in the marketplace  increased revenues and profitability may not be realized 
our future results may also be affected if our products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not interoperable with our products  and others may never be 
in addition  many of our principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm our business and prospects 
divisional sales model in january  we realigned our direct sales force  product teams and professional services capabilities into four divisions 
this reorganization was intended to enhance overall revenues and profitability by providing increased focus on each of four key markets enterprise solutions  mobile and embedded computing  internet applications and business intelligence 
in january  the acquisition of hfn now financial fusion  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary increased our focus on the financial services market 
in may  we announced the launch of ianywhere solutions  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary formed to continue the business of the mec division in mobile and wireless e business products and services 
on february   we entered into an agreement to acquire new era of networks  inc neon  a developer of enterprise application integration software 
the merger is expected to close in the second quarter of at that time  we plan to create a new e business division that will focus on incorporating neon s technology with sybase s enterprise portal platform  and certain other products and services 
further changes in our divisional sales model could have a direct affect on our results of operations 
if we have misjudged demand for our products and services in our target markets  or if our divisions and subsidiaries generally are unable to coordinate their respective sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  this could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects 
international operations we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations 
in  these revenues represented of our total revenues 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for a discussion of risks associated with currency fluctuation  see md a financial risk management foreign exchange risk above  incorporated here by reference 
our revenues from international operations could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes we have made to accommodate these conditions 
for example  in february  we acquired our distributor in denmark and in september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of our distributor in mexico 
during and  we closed subsidiaries in mexico  thailand  chile  peru and venezuela 
several significant management and organizational changes occurred in the same period  including the resignation or replacement of several country managers in europe and asia and the european general manager 
other factors that could affect aspects of our international operations include changes in political  regulatory  or economic conditions changes or limitations in trade protection laws changes in tax treaties or laws favorable to sybase natural disasters intellectual property our inability to obtain adequate copyright  patent or trade secret protection for our products in certain countries may have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
also  as the number of software products and associated patents increase  it is possible that software developers will become subject to more frequent infringement claims 
in the past  third parties have claimed that their patents or other proprietary rights were violated by sybase products 
it is possible that such claims will be asserted in the future 
regardless of whether these claims have merit  they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle  and can harm the company s business and reputation 
we do not believe our products infringe any third party patents or proprietary rights  but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims or findings of infringement in the future 
human resources our inability to hire and retain qualified technical  managerial  sales and other employees could affect our product development and sales efforts  other aspects of our operations  and our financial results 
competition for highly skilled personnel is intense 
our financial and stock price performance relative to the companies with whom we compete for employees  and the relatively high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  could also impact the degree of future employee turnover 
in recent years  we have experienced a number of changes in our board of directors and in our executive management team 
for example  in april  linda k 
yates became a member of our board 
in november  cecilia claudio also joined the board 
during  leo t 
hindery  jeffrey t 
webber and robert s 
epstein resigned from the board 
john chen became the company s chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president in in early  pieter van der vorst became the company s chief financial officer  pamela george was named vice president  corporate marketing  and daniel carl became vice president and general counsel 
in august marty beard was named vice president  corporate development  and in november  richard n 
labarbera resigned as senior vice president and general manager of esd 
in connection with the formation of ffi and ias  certain of sybase officers and employees became officers and employees of these subsidiaries 
additionally  each of ffi and ias has its own board of directors and senior management team 
further changes involving executives and managers resulting from acquisitions  mergers and other events could increase the current rate of employee turnover  particularly in consulting  engineering and sales 
additionally  further changes in board members could affect the company s current strategic business plans 
acquisitions and strategic relationships we regularly explore possible acquisitions and other strategic ventures to expand and enhance our business 
we have recently acquired or invested in a number of companies and will likely continue to do so in the future 
on february   we entered into an agreement to acquire neon  a developer of enterprise application integration software 
in february  we acquired our distributor in denmark for approximately million in cash 
in september  we acquired certain of the assets of our distributor in mexico  and in july  we invested million for a majority interest in an entity established with a subsidiary of hong kong telecom 
in january  we acquired home financial network  an internet financial services company specializing in the development of customized e finance web sites  which became ffi 
in  we acquired data warehouse network  a provider of industry specific business intelligence applications 
for a further discussion of our recent acquisitions  see notes eleven and fourteen to the condensed consolidated financial statements  incorporated here by reference 
we may not achieve the desired benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
for example  we may be unable to successfully assimilate an acquired company s management team  business infrastructure  company culture  or other important factors 
also  dedication of additional resources to handle these integration tasks could temporarily divert attention from other important business 
such acquisitions could also result in costs  liabilities  or additional expenses that could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
with respect to our investments in other companies  we may not realize a return on our investments  or the value of our investments may decline if the businesses in which we invest are not successful 
these companies include start ups seeking to develop technology that has not been tested in the marketplace 
such companies typically have no history of earnings and may lack a seasoned management team

euro currency on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversation rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the participating countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
a transition period for conversion to this new currency ended on january  to date  there has been no significant impact on our worldwide operations caused by the adoption of the euro 
the introduction and the use of the euro has not materially affected  and is not expected to affect in the future  our foreign exchange activities  our use of derivatives and other financial instruments  or result in any material cost to us 
we will continue to assess the impact of the introduction of the euro currency
