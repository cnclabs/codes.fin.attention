item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item  description of business factors that may affect future operating results and included in other portions of this report 
overview since  we have transitioned our business to focus on the leasing of portable storage units rather than their sale 
this has caused the composition of our revenues and expenses to change 
leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased to in from in  in  in and in the number of portable storage units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a cagr of 
our leasing revenues include all rent we receive for our portable storage units and other structures 
our sales revenues include sales of portable storage units and other structures to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the portable storage units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our repair and maintenance costs as incurred 
our lease fleet units are depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life of years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values ranging from to of our unit investment

table of contents compared to total revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease  partially offset by a decrease in the average rent per unit

our revenues from the sale of units increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales from the sale of units increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  decreased to in from in this reduction was primarily the result of lower per unit manufacturing and refurbishment costs of units sold 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in from in the increase in leasing related expenses as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the million of expenses associated with the ten branches we added in and higher commissions related to higher leasing volume 
in general  new branches initially have lower profit margins until the branches fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our larger lease fleet  additional manufacturing equipment and amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility 
we used this debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet and fund our branch expansion 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt increased to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs

our revenues from the sale of units decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease reflects our decision in to curtail the sale of telecommunication shelters and discontinue our dealer program 
cost of sales from the sale of units decreased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  decreased to in from in this reduction was primarily the result of lower prices for used ocean going containers and the fact that we produced more portable storage units at our manufacturing facility in than in leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in leasing related expenses was primarily due to the million of expenses associated with the seven branches we added in and higher commissions related to our higher leasing volume 
leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in from in due to these expenses being spread over a larger revenue base in 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our larger lease fleet  additional manufacturing equipment and amortization of goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased by  due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility

we have financed the growth of our lease fleet and our higher working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from equity financings and borrowings under our credit facility 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in  million in and million in this increasing cash flow resulted primarily from our higher net income and the impact of depreciation expense and deferred income taxes 
the growth of our business  however  has required us to use more cash to support higher levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in this increasing use of cash resulted primarily from higher levels of capital expenditures for lease fleet and branch expansion 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in in addition  we spent million in  million including million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock in and million in for acquisitions 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during  net cash provided by financing activities was provided by our credit facility  which we used to expand our lease fleet and finance our branch expansion 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our public offering of  shares of common stock 
we received gross proceeds of approximately million from our common stock offering  and we received approximately million from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the majority of warrants exercised were issued in connection with our initial public offering in our principal source of liquidity has been our credit facility  which currently consists of a revolving line of credit and a term loan 
the interest rate under our credit facility is determined quarterly  based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
during  the average interest rate under our credit facility was  including the effect of the interest rate swap agreement 
as of february  we had million of outstanding borrowings under our million revolving line of credit  and million of additional borrowings were available under the credit facility 
the amount we can borrow under the revolving line of credit portion of our credit facility is based upon the level of our inventories  accounts receivable and the value of our lease fleet 
the lease fleet is appraised at least annually for purposes of the credit facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets  including all of our portable storage units 
the credit facility includes a term loan due in march  with a one year extension option 
the term loan had an outstanding principal balance of million at december  we must make principal and interest payments monthly on the term loan 

table of contents we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  under which we have effectively fixed  for a three year period  the interest rate payable on an aggregate of million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit so that the rate is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the eurodollar rate 
under these agreements  we have effectively fixed  for a three year period expiring in february  the interest rate payable on million  million and million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit so that the rate is based upon a spread from  and  respectively  rather than a spread from the eurodollar rate 
in october  we issued million of senior subordinated notes with detachable redeemable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
these notes were due november  but could be prepaid beginning november  without a prepayment penalty 
we redeemed the entire principal balance outstanding on november  because the notes were sold with redeemable warrants  a portion of the sale price was allocated to the notes and a portion to the redeemable warrants  based on their respective fair market values 
the resulting discount increased the effective interest rate on the notes and was amortized as interest expense over the life of the notes 
in connection with the early redemption of these notes  we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  net of a tax provision  in we believe that our working capital  together with our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and other available funding sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned growth for at least the months following this offering 
thereafter  we believe that we will need additional debt or equity financing to maintain historical growth rates 
seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the past several years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
an interest rate swap agreement is the only instrument we used to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we had one outstanding interest rate swap agreement covering million of our debt 
under that agreement  we paid a fixed rate and received a variable interest rate 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio total fair total at value at at december  december  december  thereafter liabilities fixed rate in s average interest rate floating rate in s      average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed in s    average pay rate average receive rate mo libor bba 
table of contents we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described above  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  during february we entered into two new interest rate swap agreements and extended the swap agreement described above 
our credit facility matures in  including a one year extension option 
these variable rate liabilities will continue to increase due to future growth until maturity 
see note line of credit in the notes to financial statements incorporated herein by reference for further description of the variable rate liability 
management intends to renew or replace the line of credit with similar arrangements or debt prior to maturity  on terms reasonably similar to their existing terms 
we  however  cannot be certain that such financing will be available or on terms acceptable to us
