item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general administrative expense 
operating income interest expense net earnings net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in this increase is the result of several offsetting factors 
first  sales of the company s model posi track increased significantly as was the first full year of production for this product 
this product was available for less than two quarters in second  the company introduced a new product in the third quarter of  the rc 
all surface loader 
the company sold nearly all its production of this model 
third  sales of used equipment increased in due to increased marketing efforts  including the opening of a retail store in grand rapids  minnesota in the second quarter of lastly  offsetting these factors was a decrease in sales relating to posi track machines sold under military contracts 
net sales for the year ended december  decreased to approximately  compared with  in this decrease is the result of several offsetting factors 
first  the company closed the transaction with caterpillar in january the company spent much of transitioning from its mostly independent dealer network to the caterpillar dealer network 
based on the success the company had selling to caterpillar dealers in prior years  it was felt the transition to additional caterpillar dealers would be a relatively simple process 
however  the degree to which these additional caterpillar dealers embraced new products  such as asv s posi track  varied greatly 
this required increased training and market development activity by both the company and the dealers to get the necessary marketing programs and other support in place 
during this time period  sales decreased 
second  in  the company introduced a new model posi track  the  that incorporated many caterpillar components 
the initial production of the was later than anticipated due to delays encountered during the initial production process  leading to decreased sales during primarily the third quarter of offsetting these two factors was an increase in sales of approximately million relating to posi track machines sold under military contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately  compared with approximately  for the increase is a result of increased net sales as discussed above offset in part by a decrease in the company s gross profit percentage from in to in the decrease in gross profit percentage is due to several factors 
first  sales of the company s model posi track  its highest gross profit product  decreased significantly during the second half of the year  due in part to a nationwide slowdown in construction equipment spending 
second  the company experienced inefficiencies during its initial start up of production of its rc 
all surface loader during the third quarter of third  the company offered discounts on certain of its models to lower its inventory of finished goods 
finally  the company had increased sales of lower margin used equipment in compared with as discussed above 
for the year ended december   gross profit decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  for this decrease is a result of decreased sales in as discussed above and a decrease in the company s gross profit percentage from in to in the decreased gross profit percentage is due to several factors 
first  as discussed above  the company experienced delays resulting in production inefficiencies during its initial start up of production for the during the third quarter of second  the military contract discussed above had a significantly lower gross profit percentage than the company s typical sales to its dealers 
this was due to the high subcontract costs on this military contract 
also  the company experienced increased warranty costs as a percentage of net sales  mainly from earlier model machines  which were not fully recovered from its vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the twelve months ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  from approximately  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from in to in the increased level of expenses was due primarily to two factors 
first  the company had increased marketing expenses in consisting of additional dealer support programs and a full year of costs for field service representatives hired during the fourth quarter of also  the company paid a greater commission to caterpillar in due to increased sales to caterpillar dealers and a full twelve months of commissionable sales in compared with eleven months in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to sales increasing at a faster rate than expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased from of net sales in to of net sales in the increased level of expenses was due to several factors 
first  the company began paying a commission to caterpillar for sales to its dealers in  which accounted for approximately of the increase 
second  the company increased its marketing efforts to assist in the transition of selling to caterpillar dealers 
these marketing efforts included increased start up  training and market development costs  as well as additional sales and support personnel hired to service the dealers added in in addition  the company integrated its computer system with caterpillar s to allow caterpillar dealers to place orders for whole machines and parts and process warranty claims in a similar fashion as they do with caterpillar 
the increased expenses combined with the decreased sales caused an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses when expressed as a percentage of net sales 
research and development 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase was due primarily to the joint development of the first two of five expected models of multi terrain loaders with caterpillar and introduction of the company s rc 
all surface loader product 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased approximately  to  compared with approximately  for the increase is due primarily to the introduction of the model posi track  continued work on the company s rc 
all surface loader product and enhancements to existing posi track models 
the company anticipates research and development expenses will increase substantially in as it continues the development of the multi terrain loaders with caterpillar as well as extensions of the asv product line 
for  the company anticipates it may spend approximately million on research and development 
the company believes its anticipated expenditure for research and development in will be less than the expected level for interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in  compared with approximately  in and  in the decrease in was due to decreased line of credit usage 
this was a result of increased cash flow  primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to caterpillar in the fourth quarter of the decrease in was the combination of two offsetting factors 
interest expense decreased in as the company s convertible debentures were exchanged for common stock in offsetting this decrease was an increase in borrowings under the company s line of credit during net earnings 
net earnings for the twelve months ended december  were approximately  compared with approximately  for this increase was due to increased sales  offset in part by a lower gross profit percentage and increased operating expenses 
in addition  the company s effective income tax rate decreased in due to greater research and development tax credits 
for the year ended december   net earnings decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  in this decrease was due to decreased sales with a lower gross profit and increased operating expenses  offset in part by lower interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources in october  the company completed a securities purchase agreement in which caterpillar purchased  newly issued shares of asv common stock at per share increasing its ownership in asv to approximately 
the company also amended its original warrant issued to caterpillar reducing the number of shares of asv common stock available for purchase under the warrant by  shares 
as of december   the company had working capital of approximately  an increase of approximately  from the main reason for this increase was the company s sale of shares of its common stock to caterpillar in october other items affecting working capital include an increase of approximately  in accounts receivable due to increased sales and greater use of extended terms  generally not exceeding days  on the sale of the company s products 
the company reduced its inventory levels by approximately  in by reducing its finished goods inventory and decreasing its level of raw materials on hand 
in addition  the company paid off its entire line of credit balance during from funds generated from operations 
in december  the company made a sale to one customer totaling approximately million 
due to physical space limitations at the customer s facilities  delivery of the product is being made during the months of january through april the company has agreed to provide interest free terms for these products until july  any product sold by the customer prior to july  must be paid by the tenth day of the month following the month of sale 
for any product not paid by july   the company has agreed to provide floor plan financing at the rate of per annum  such interest to be payable monthly 
all remaining unpaid amounts and any accrued interest are due and payable december  the company has followed the requirements for revenue recognition as set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements for this transaction 
at december   the company s working capital increased  to approximately  the primary reason for the increase was the proceeds from the company s sale of shares of its common stock and a warrantto caterpillar  which resulted in an immediate increase in working capital of million 
the company utilized the proceeds from this transaction initially to pay off advances under its line of credit and to fund current operations 
inventory levels increased compared with december  due to several reasons 
during the transition to caterpillar dealers  the company chose not to reduce its production levels  but instead  increased its finished goods  primarily its series posi tracks 
other reasons for the inventory increase include the general increase in inventory needed to begin production of the new model posi track  the long lead times to purchase certain inventory items  and the need to inventory service parts for older model machines that are in the field 
in addition  as the company transitioned from independent dealers to caterpillar dealers  the company chose to repurchase the inventory held by the independent dealers 
to the extent possible  this inventory was transferred to new caterpillar dealers 
any inventory not transferred was brought to the company s facilities and accounted for the majority of the million increase in used equipment held for resale 
current liabilities decreased slightly from  with the company s line of credit borrowings increasing to fund current operations and accounts payable decreasing as the company reduced its purchasing volume in the fourth quarter of accrued commission increased in due to the commissions payable under the commercial alliance agreement with caterpillar 
in october  the company and caterpillar entered into an alliance agreement in which they plan to jointly develop and manufacture a new product line of caterpillar rubber track skid steer loaders called multi terrain loaders 
the product line  which is expected to include five new models  will feature caterpillar s patented skid steer loader technology and asv s patent pending maximum traction support system tm rubber track undercarriage 
the machines are expected to complement existing models in both asv s and caterpillar s current product lines 
they will be sold through the caterpillar dealer network 
under the terms of this alliance agreement  asv intends to use a portion of the stock sale proceeds to fund development of the new models 
the first two models are expected to be introduced to a limited number of north american caterpillar dealers in the second quarter of the new machines will be assembled in sanford  nc  at caterpillar s skid steer loader facility 
the undercarriages will be manufactured at asv headquarters in grand rapids  minnesota 
the company will recognize as sales its cost for the undercarriage  plus a portion of the gross profit that caterpillar will recognize upon sale of the mtl to caterpillar dealers  when the company ships undercarriages to caterpillar 
the mtl s are not a commissionable product under the commercial alliance agreement 
in january  the company entered into a licensing agreement that allows polaris to sell an asv built  rubber track  all surface utility loader similar to the company s rc 
all surface loader 
the agreement gives polaris the right to market and sell the utility loader under its own nameplate through its worldwide dealer network 
polaris will purchase the machines  as well as parts and attachments  directly from asv 
the agreement also provides the option at some future point for polaris to manufacture the machines under a royalty arrangement if volume exceeds asv s competitive capabilities 
the company will sell the polaris branded machine  as well as parts and accessories  to polaris on a cost plus basis 
the gross profit on these machines will be less than the gross profit asv recognizes on the sale of its rc 
product  parts and accessories 
however  the company does not expect to incur significant after sale costs on the sale of products to polaris 
the company believes its existing cash and marketable securities  together with cash expected to be provided by operations and available  unused credit lines  will satisfy the company s projected working capital needs and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the statements set forth above under liquidity and capital resources and elsewhere in this form k regarding asv s anticipated future sales and earnings  its plans to jointly develop and manufacture rubber tracked machines with caterpillar  including the number of models to be developed  the timing of their planned introduction and asv s plans to manufacture and sell machines to polaris  including the timing of their planned introduction  the anticipated revenues from the sale of machines to polaris and caterpillar  asv s anticipated research and development expenditures and asv s overall revenue goals are forward looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions  and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
certain factors may affect whether these machines are ultimately produced including asv s ability to successfully manufacture the machines  unanticipated delays  costs or other difficulties in the manufacture of the machines  market acceptance of the machines  general market conditions  corporate developments at asv  polaris or caterpillar and asv s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its relationship with polaris and caterpillar
