the company s capital and operating requirements may change depending upon various factors  including i whether the company and its strategic partners achieve success in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products  ii the amount of resources which the company devotes to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments  in particular the company may expend funds for development of its proteomics and psma technologies 
the company s financial objectives are to meet its capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements 
to achieve its strategic objectives  the company may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by the company in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
however  the company believes that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  the company may sell equity and debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations since its inception  and has expended  and expects to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement its planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further its marketing and sales programs 
the company expects that its existing capital resources together with the acqua wellington equity line should be adequate to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future 
the company cannot be certain that it will not consume a significant amount of its currently available resources and reasonably expects that it will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when it reaches profitability  for further development of products  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
the company s future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including the successful commercialization of its products  the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  progress in its product development efforts  the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with clinical trials  progress with regulatory affairs activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of its products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  the company will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
based on the company s historical ability to raise capital and current market conditions  the company believes other financing alternatives are available 
there can be no assurance that the financing commitments described above or other financial alternatives will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to the company 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of its operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected
