item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this prospectus contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under certain risks that may affect our business and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell systems  known as video storage servers  that automate the management and distribution of both short form video streams  such as advertisements  and long form video streams  such as movies or other feature presentations  each of which requires precise  accurate and continuous execution  and the related services and movie content to television operators  telecommunications companies and broadcast television companies 
revenues from sales of systems are recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
installation  project management and training revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from technical support and maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements  generally twelve months 
customers are billed for installation  project management  training and maintenance at the time of the product sale 
if a portion of the sales price is not due until installation of the system is complete  that portion of the sales price is deferred until installation is complete 
revenue from content fees  primarily movies  is recognized based on the volume of monthly purchases that are made by hotel guests 
revenue from product development contract services is recognized based on the time and materials incurred to complete the work 
shipping and handling costs are included in revenue and cost of revenues 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
systems sales always include one year of free technical support and maintenance services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training  project management  technical support and maintenance and content fees is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
the amount allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation  training and project management services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
seachange has experienced fluctuations in its systems revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of receipt of customer orders include among other factors customer obtaining authorized signatures on their purchase orders  budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  and the time required to produce and test the system before delivery 
because the average sales price of a seachange system is high  the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in quarterly fluctuations in seachange s revenue 
our results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including our pricing  the costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations 
we price our products and services based upon our costs as well as in consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined over time 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing  customer service and support and administration 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of digital video arts  ltd 
in exchange for  shares of our common stock using an exchange ratio of of one share of our common stock for each share of digital video arts 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
digital video arts is a developer of custom software products specializing in digital video and interactive television 
as a result of the acquisition  digital video arts became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all the periods presented have been restated to include the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of digital video arts 
year ended december  compared to the year ended january  systems 
our systems revenues consist of sales of our broadband and broadcast products 
systems revenues increased from million in the twelve months ended december  to million in the twelve months ended january  revenues from the broadband segment  which accounted for of total revenues in the twelve months ended january  and of total revenues in the twelve months ended december   increased from million in to million in the increase in broadband revenues is primarily attributable to the sale of interactive television systems to us cable operators who began to deploy residential video on demand services to their subscriber base during the twelve months ended january  broadcast system segment revenues were million in the twelve months ended january  compared to million in the twelve months ended december  the increase in broadcast revenues for the twelve months ended january  was primarily due to shipments for new broadcast customers in the us  europe and the far east 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our interactive television and broadcast system products as cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new video on demand applications for their customers and the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand 
as revenues from broadcast and interactive television products increase  the digital advertising products will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  seachange believes that there will be a continued demand for expansions to existing digital advertising insertion systems within the us and growth potential for new interactive advertising systems in the future 
services 
our services revenues consist of fees for installation  training  product maintenance  technical support services and movie content fees 
our services revenues increased to million in twelve months ended january  from million in the twelve months ended december  this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the renewals of existing technical support and maintenance  price increases on certain technical support and maintenance services  the impact of a growing installed base of systems and a higher volume of product development services 
for the twelve month periods ended january  and december   certain customers each accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers each accounted for and of total revenues in the twelve months ended january  and and of total revenues in the twelve months ended december  revenue from these customers was primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that revenues from current and future large customers will continue to represent a significant proportion of total revenues 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the twelve month periods ended january  and december   respectively 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
we do not expect to change this practice in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
if this practice changes in the future  we will reevaluate our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
gross profit systems 
costs of systems revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses 
costs of systems revenues increased to million in the twelve months ended january  as compared to million in the twelve months ended december  in the twelve months ended january   the cost of systems revenues increased from the prior year primarily as a result of higher systems revenues 
we expect the cost of systems revenues for the interactive television products within the broadband segment to be higher as a percentage of revenues as the products are first deployed and to decrease as a percentage of revenues as the revenue level increases and we improve our manufacturing and material purchasing efficiencies 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was and in the twelve months ended january  and december   respectively 
the increase in systems gross profit in the twelve months ended january  was primarily due to lower material and other manufacturing costs as a percentage of systems revenue within the broadband segment and specifically for system revenues for the digital advertising insertion products 
seachange was able to reduce manufacturing material costs principally through improved purchasing methods despite the continued trend towards the purchase of smaller scale digital advertising insertion systems and expansions to existing systems that have higher material content 
gross profit for the broadband segment improved from for the twelve months ended december  to for the twelve months ended january  while gross profit for the broadcast segment was and for the twelve months ended january  and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
seachange does not know if the reductions in material and labor costs as a percentage of revenues for the broadband segment will continue in the future 
services 
costs of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services provided by us and costs associated with providing movie content 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the twelve months ended december  to million in the twelve months ended january   primarily as a result of increased revenues and the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue was in the twelve months ended january  and in the twelve months ended december  improvements in the services gross profit in the twelve months ended january  reflect the increase in the installed base of systems under maintenance  price increases on certain annual technical support and maintenance services and higher product development revenues 
we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of services revenue as a result of the timing of revenues from product and maintenance support and other services to support the growing installed base of systems and the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to build a service organization to support the installed base of systems and new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million in the twelve months ended december  to million in the twelve months ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue to focus on the development of new technology and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of the compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in the twelve months ended december  to million in the twelve months ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products  increased sales commissions on higher revenues and higher marketing expenses specifically for tradeshow and other promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in the twelve months ended december  to million in the twelve months ended january  this increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses associated with various litigation matters and accounting expenses associated primarily with tax matters 
interest expense income  net 
interest expense  net  was approximately  in the twelve months ended january  and interest income  net was approximately  in the twelve months ended december  the increase in in interest expense  net  primarily resulted from interest expense on increased borrowings under seachange s lines of credit and new borrowings under seachange s construction loan 
provision benefit for income taxes 
seachange s effective tax rate for the twelve months ended january  differed from the us federal statutory tax rate due to the utilization of research and development tax credits 
seachange s effective tax benefit rate was for the twelve months ended january  as compared to for the twelve months ended december seachange had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million at december   january  and january   respectively 
although realizability is not assured  based on the weight of available evidence  seachange believes it is more likely than not that all remaining deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
seachange will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if seachange does not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods 
cumulative effect change in accounting principle 
during the fourth quarter of the twelve months ended january   seachange implemented the sec s sab guidelines  retroactive to the beginning of the year 
this was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of february  historically  for some of seachange s sales transactions  a portion of the sales price  typically  was not due until installation occurred 
seachange now defers the portion of the sales price not due until installation is complete 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of  or per diluted share which has been included in income for the fiscal year ending january  for the twelve months ended january   seachange recognized million in revenue that is included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of february  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues systems 
systems revenues increased from million in to million in revenues from the digital advertising insertion products or spot systems  which accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively  increased slightly from million in to million in the most significant increase in systems revenues in compared to resulted primarily from the sale of broadcast systems  a product that was first introduced and sold by us in the second quarter of broadcast product revenues increased from million  or of total revenues  in to million  or of total revenues  in in addition  during the third quarter of  we sold our first interactive television systems which are used by cable operators and telecommunications companies to provide movie and other interactive services directly to the home of the cable subscriber 
revenues from the interactive television products were  in these increases in systems revenues were offset in part by a million decrease in systems revenues from the movies products which was principally due to the timing of receiving a relatively small number of orders with a high average value per order 
we expect future revenue growth  if any  to come principally from our broadcast and interactive television segments as the market for digital video servers within the broadcast industry continues to expand and cable and telecommunications companies continue to offer new video on demand applications for their customers 
as revenues from broadcast and interactive television segments increase  the digital advertising segment will become a smaller portion of total system revenues 
however  we believe that there will be a continued demand for expansions to existing digital advertising insertion systems within the us and growth potential for new interactive advertising systems in the future 
for the years ended december  and  certain customers accounted for more than of our total revenues 
individual customers accounted for and of total revenues in and and of total revenues in revenues from these customers were predominantly in the digital advertising insertion segment 
we believe that revenues from current and future large customers will continue to represent a significant proportion of our total revenues 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
as of december   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
we do not expect to change this practice in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
if this practice changes in the future  we will reevaluate our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
services 
our services revenues increased to million in from million in this increase in services revenues primarily resulted from the renewals of maintenance and support contracts and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
gross profit systems 
costs of systems revenues increased from million in to million in in  the increase in costs of systems revenues reflects the higher revenue level of systems sales and increased manufacturing labor and overhead costs incurred to support changes in the product mix  including the introduction of the new broadcast and video on demand products 
we expect costs of systems revenues for broadcast and interactive television products to be higher as a percentage of revenue when the products are first introduced and to decrease as a percentage of revenues as we improve manufacturing efficiencies  spread fixed costs over a larger production volume and achieve lower material costs through improved purchasing efficiencies 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues were and in and  respectively 
gross profit for the digital advertising insertion and the movies products increased from and in to and in  respectively  primarily as a result of continued reductions in manufacturing material and labor costs as a percentage of segment revenues 
seachange was able to reduce manufacturing material costs principally through improved purchasing methods despite the continued trend towards the purchase of smaller scale digital advertising insertion systems and expansions to existing systems that have higher material content 
gross profit for the broadcast product also improved from in to in as a result of higher revenues and lower material and labor manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenues 
seachange does not know if the reductions in material and labor costs as a percentage of revenues for the advertising insertion products will continue in the future 
the gross profits in and were impacted by increases of approximately million and  respectively  in our inventory valuation allowance 
these increases were within the digital advertising insertion product and were the result of new product introductions within this area and the identification and anticipation of inventory write downs of slower turning excess and obsolete materials 
seachange does not anticipate a significant amount of inventory write offs in the future because we have established inventory controls which provides for better inventory management during the transition period of new product introductions 
we evaluate inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and provide a valuation allowance for estimated inactive  obsolete and surplus inventory 
services 
costs of services revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of digital ad insertion  movie  broadcast and video on demand systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit margin as a percentage of services revenue was in and in the higher services gross profit in is primarily due to higher level of services revenue 
we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of services revenue as a result of the timing of revenues from product and maintenance support and other services to support the growing installed base of systems and the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to build a service organization to support the installed base of systems and new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in the dollar amount in was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
all internal software development costs to date have been expensed 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue our development and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses remained flat at million in and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease in the dollar amounts was primarily attributable to lower payroll and related costs related to the centralization of accounting and administrative functions and lower legal costs 
restructuring of operations 
in march  we recorded a charge of  for the restructuring of operations as part of a planned consolidation of the operations of sc asia 
the charge for restructuring included  related to the termination of employees  a provision of  related to the planned vacating of premises and  of compensation expense associated with stock options for certain terminated employees 
at march   we had notified all terminated employees 
all restructuring charges were paid as of december  acquisition costs 
on december   we acquired all of the authorized and outstanding common stock of digital video arts  ltd 
in exchange for  shares of our common stock using an exchange ratio of of one share of our common stock for each share of digital video arts 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
digital video arts is a developer of custom software products specializing in digital video and interactive television 
as a result of the acquisition  digital video arts became our wholly owned subsidiary 
total revenues of million for the year ended december  consisted of million of our revenues and million of digital video arts revenues 
net income of  for the same period consisted of our net income of million and a digital video arts net loss of  included in net income were acquisition costs of  consisting primarily of professional service fees 
due to the acquisition  digital video arts previously unrecognized tax benefits of operating loss carryforwards were recognized in our consolidated results in the applicable period 
interest income  net 
interest income  net was approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income  net in primarily resulted from lower average invested balances in and interest expense on borrowings 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was and in and  respectively  due to the taxable loss in and the utilization of operating tax loss carryforwards associated with the acquisition of digital video arts in one month ended january  compared to the one month ended january  revenues systems 
systems revenues decreased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  this decrease in systems revenues resulted primarily from the timing of receipt of customer orders and related shipment within both the broadband and broadcast segments 
services 
our services revenues increased from approximately million in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  this increase in services revenues resulted primarily from renewals of technical support and maintenance  higher product development revenues and the impact of a growing installed base of systems 
for the one month period ended january  and january   certain individual customers accounted for more than of our total revenues 
single customers accounted for and of total revenues in one month ended january  and  and of total revenues in the one month ended january  revenues from these customers were primarily in the broadband segment 
we believe that revenues from current and future large customers will continue to represent a significant proportion of total revenues 
international sales accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the one month ended january  and january   respectively 
we expect that international sales will remain a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
as of january   substantially all sales of our products were made in united states dollars 
we do not expect any material change to this practice in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience in the near term  any material impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations or liquidity 
if this practice changes in the future  we will reevaluate our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
gross profit systems 
costs of systems revenues decreased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  for the one month ended january   the decrease in cost of systems revenues primarily reflects lower systems revenue offset in part by fixed manufacturing labor and overhead costs 
systems gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was a negative in the one month ended january  in the one month ended january   gross profit as a percentage of systems revenues was 
the decrease in systems gross profit in was primarily due to lower systems revenue and higher material and fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of systems revenues 
services 
costs of services revenues increased from approximately million in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january   primarily as a result of the costs associated with our hiring and training additional service personnel to provide worldwide support for the growing installed base of broadband and broadcast systems and costs associated with providing movie content 
services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in the one month ended january  compared to a gross profit margin of in the one month ended january we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of services revenue as a result of the timing of revenues from technical support and maintenance and other services to support the growing installed base of systems and the timing of costs associated with our ongoing investment required to build a service organization to support the installed base of systems and new products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from approximately million  in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  the increase in the dollar amount was primarily attributable to the hiring and contracting of additional development personnel which reflects our continuing investment in new products 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue our development and support of new and existing products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from  in the one month ended january  to million in the one month ended january  this increase is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel for our broadcast and interactive television products and higher tradeshow expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in the one month ended january  to  in the one month ended january  interest income  net

our effective tax benefit rate was and in the one month ended january  and january  respectively 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present certain unaudited quarterly information for the quarterly periods in the years ended january   january  and december  previously reported amounts for the first  second and third quarters of have been restated to give effect to the cumulative change in accounting principle see note to the consolidated financial statements and the adoption of eitf  accounting for shipping and handling revenues and costs 
in addition  previously reported amounts for the year ended december  have been recast to present prior year periods on a basis comparable with the current year end 
this information is derived from unaudited financial statements and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited financial statements which appear elsewhere in this document 
in the opinion of our management  this data reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results  and we believe that period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

a significant portion of our revenues have been generated from a limited number of customers and it is difficult to predict the timing of future orders and shipments to these and other customers 
customers can cancel or reschedule shipments  and development or production difficulties could delay shipments 
during the quarterly periods for the last two years  we experienced variations in our revenues from quarter to quarter primarily related to the significant growth of our interactive television products in the broadband segment and broadcast segment products 
the broadcast segment revenues increased from million in the first quarter of to a high of million in the third quarter of fiscal year january  during this same time period  interactive television system revenues increased from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the twelve months ended january  we have also experienced significant variations in our quarterly systems gross margins 
changes in pricing policies  the product mix  the timing and significance of new product introductions and product enhancements  and fluctuations in the number of systems so affects manufacturing efficiencies and  accordingly  the gross profits 
quarterly services gross margins have historically fluctuated significantly because installation and training service revenue varies by quarter while the related costs are relatively consistent by quarter 
during the quarterly periods in and fiscal year  the gross margins improved significantly from a low of in the first quarter of to a high of in the third quarter of the twelve months ended january  as a result of a reduction in prices of hardware components for digital advertising insertion and broadcast segment products and increased revenues 
operating expenses also vary with the number  timing and significance of new product and product enhancement introductions by us and our competitors  increased competition  the gain or loss of significant customers  the hiring of new personnel and general economic conditions 
during the quarterly periods in and in the twelve months ended january   we experienced certain fluctuations in our operating expenses 
specifically  acquisition costs related to our purchase of digital video arts in the fourth quarter of resulted in increased operating expenses 
during the twelve months ended january   we increased headcount within our research and development and sales and marketing areas to reflect our continued investment in future product development and our desire to increase our interactive television and broadcast revenues 
as a result  our expenses in both of these areas increased during the year 
in addition  our selling and marketing costs fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of large tradeshows that take place in the first and third quarter of the year and significant promotional costs that are incurred for new product introductions 
all of the above factors are difficult for us to forecast  and these or other factors may materially adversely effect our business  financial condition and results of operations for one quarter or a series of quarters 
only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenues in the short term and there would likely be a material adverse effect on our operating results if future revenues are lower than expectations 
based upon all of the foregoing  we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and  therefore  should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
for the quarter ended april   seachange expects to generate revenues of approximately to million and net income of a penny per share 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds of our common stock  borrowings and cash flows generated from operations 
cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at january  to million at january  working capital increased from approximately million at january  to approximately million at january  net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the twelve months ended january  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the twelve months ended december  the net cash used in operating activities in the twelve months ended january  was the result of the net loss adjusted for non cash expenses including depreciation and amortization of million offset by changes in certain operating assets and liabilities 
the significant net changes in assets and liabilities that used cash in operations included an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
inventory levels increased during the period principally as a result of new product introductions within the interactive television and broadcast product areas 
increases of inventory levels occurred in each of these product areas specifically for customer demonstration equipment and procurement commitments in component inventories with an average order to delivery requirement of twelve to fifteen weeks 
we expect these inventory levels to decrease and then stabilize as revenues from both these products increase 
we expect that the broadcast segment and the interactive television products within the broadband segment will continue to require a significant amount of cash to fund future product development  to manufacture and deploy customer test and demonstration equipment and to meet higher revenue levels in both product segments 
these items that used cash in operations were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million for the twelve months ended january  and december   respectively 
investment activity consisted primarily of capital expenditures related to construction to expand the current manufacturing facility and the acquisition of computer equipment  office furniture  and other capital equipment required to support the expansion and growth of the business 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and  for the twelve months ended january  and december   respectively 
in the twelve months ended january   the cash provided by financing included million received in connection with the issuance of common stock million of which was issued to microsoft corporation and million in borrowings under the lines of credit and our construction loan 
microsoft entered into an agreement with us to collaborate on extending microsoft windows media technologies from broadband internet delivery to cable and broadcast television systems 
concurrent with this agreement  microsoft purchased  shares of our common stock for million at below the average closing price of our common stock over ten trading days ending one trading day prior to the date of the relevant commercial milestones 
microsoft has agreed to purchase additional shares of our common stock based upon the achievement of mutually agreed upon development milestones including the development of software that meets specific streaming performance levels and the commercial release of an enhanced version of the software that will be used with microsoft s next generation media server 
during the same period  cash used in financing activities included approximately million in principal payments under our equipment line of credit and capital lease obligations 
seachange had a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment line of credit with a bank 
this revolving line of credit expired in march and seachange s ability to make purchases under the equipment line of credit expired in march in july  seachange renewed its revolving line of credit and equipment line of credit with a bank 
the revolving line of credit was extended until march and borrowings under the facility increased to million 
the equipment line of credit was extended to provide seachange additional equipment financing of million through march in addition  seachange entered into a million line of credit facility with the export import bank of the united states exim which allows seachange to borrow money based upon eligible foreign customer account balances 
the ability to borrow funds by seachange under this facility also expired in march seachange is currently in the process of negotiating the renewal of all its lines of credit 
borrowings under all the lines of credit are collateralized by substantially all of seachange s assets 
loans made under the revolving line of credit would generally bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the libor rate plus at january  
loans under the exim line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate at january  
loans made under the equipment line of credit bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the bank s base rate plus at january  
the loan agreement relating to the lines of credit requires that seachange provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios including the maintenance of total liabilities  excluding deferred revenue  to net worth ratio of at least 
to at january   seachange was not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the loan agreement for all the lines of credit 
subsequent to year end  seachange received a waiver of non compliance from the bank 
as of january   there were million in borrowings against the revolving line of credit and borrowings outstanding under the equipment line of credit were million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the exim line of credit at january in october  seachange entered into an agreement with a bank to finance million of the construction costs related to the purchase and renovation of a manufacturing mill in new hampshire that seachange previously purchased in february during the construction period  interest is accrued and payable at a per annum rate of 
upon occupancy of the building  the loan converted into two promissory notes whereby seachange will pay principal and interest based upon a fixed interest rate per annum over a five and ten year period  respectively at january  
borrowings under the loan are secured by the land and buildings of the renovated mill 
the loan agreement requires that seachange provide the bank with certain periodic financial reports and comply with certain financial ratios 
at january   seachange were in compliance with all covenants 
as of january   borrowings outstanding under the loan were million 
on february   seachange received million from a private placement sale of common stock and a warrant to comcast sc investment  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that existing funds together with available borrowings under the revolving lines of credit are adequate to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments as of january  we had non cancelable purchase commitments for inventories of approximately  at january  one month ended january  during the one month periods ended january  and january   we used cash in operations of million  and million  respectively 
it is typical for us to experience fluctuations in our monthly operating results primarily due to the timing of receiving customer orders and the related shipment of these customer orders 
as a result of these monthly fluctuations  we may experience an increase in our inventories as a result of procurement of both short and long lead components for anticipated orders for both our product segments  a decrease in our accounts payable balance primarily due to the timing of payments for materials purchased for prior month shipments  a decrease in accounts receivable amounts as a result of customer payments without corresponding customer shipments and a resulting decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
effects of inflation our management believes that financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
this accounting standard amended the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we will adopt sfas no 
 as amended  in fiscal year to date we have not utilized derivative instruments or hedging activities and  therefore  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure has been related to local currency revenue and operating expenses in europe and asia 
historically  we have not hedged specific currency exposures as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions have not been material to date 
at december  and january   we had million and million outstanding related to variable rate us dollar denominated short term debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  interest expense on these short term borrowings would increase by  and  for the twelve month periods ended december  and january  the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  and january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be securities purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at december  and january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
as a result  we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures
