forward looking information and factors affecting future performance this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities and exchange commission act of for this purpose  any statements contained in this annual report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements  including among others  the factors set forth below 
if any risk or uncertainty identified in the following factors actually occurs  idx s business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
in that event  the market price of idx s common stock could decline 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results  financial condition or business over time 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results 
the following important factors affect idx s business and operations generally or affect more than one segment of our business and operations quarterly operating results may vary 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may vary in the future 
idx expects its quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate 
because a significant percentage of idx s expenses are relatively fixed  the following factors could cause these fluctuations 
delays in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors such as consideration and management changes  
long sales cycles  
long installation and implementation cycles for the larger  more complex and costlier systems  
recognizing revenue at various points during the installation process  
timing of new product and service introductions and product upgrade releases  and 
long sales and implementation cycles of idx s customers 
in light of the above  idx believes that its results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily meaningful or reliable indicators of future performance 
volatility of stock price 
idx has experienced  and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its stock price due to a variety of factors including 
actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  
changes in expectations of future financial performance  
changes in estimates of securities analysts  
market conditions particularly in the computer software and internet industries  
announcements of technological innovations  including internet delivery of information and use of application service provider technology  
new product introductions by idx or its competitors  
delay in customers purchasing decisions due to a variety of factors  
market prices of competitors  and 
healthcare reform measures and healthcare regulation 
these fluctuations have had a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  and may have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may affect operating results as follows 
ability to transact stock acquisitions  and 
ability to retain and incent key employees 
financial trends 
year over year net income and cash from operations have generally declined since in  idx generated a net loss of approximately million 
if these negative trends continue  idx may have difficulty financing future growth and funding operating initiatives  including future acquisitions 
new product development and rapidly changing technology 
to be successful  idx must enhance its existing products  respond effectively to technology changes and help its clients adopt new technologies 
in addition  idx must introduce new products and technologies to meet the evolving needs of its clients in the healthcare information systems market 
idx may have difficulty in accomplishing this because of 
the continuing evolution of industry standards  for example  transaction standards pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of  and 
the creation of new technological developments  for example  internet and application service provider technology 
idx is currently devoting significant resources toward the development of enhancements to its existing products  particularly in the area of internet based functionality and the migration of existing products to new hardware and software platforms  including relational database technology  object oriented programming and application service provider technology 
however  idx may not successfully complete these product developments or the adaptation in a timely fashion  and idx s current or future products may not satisfy the needs of the healthcare information systems market 
any of these developments may adversely affect idx s competitive position or render its products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete 
changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry 
idx currently derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of financial  administrative and clinical healthcare information systems and related services within the healthcare industry 
as a result  the success of idx is dependent in part on the political and economic conditions in the healthcare industry 
virtually all of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship operate in the healthcare industry and  as a result  are subject to governmental regulation  including medicare and medicaid regulation 
accordingly  idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship are affected by changes in such regulations and limitations in governmental spending for medicare and medicaid programs 
recent actions by congress have limited governmental spending for the medicare and medicaid programs  limited payments to hospitals and other providers under such programs  and increased emphasis on competition and other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship 
in addition  federal and state legislatures have considered proposals to reform the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
if enacted  these proposals could increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise change the business environment of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship 
idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship could react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding these proposals by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for idx s products and services 
in addition  many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for idx s products and services 
if idx is forced to reduce its prices  its operating margins would decrease 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  competition for customers will become more intense and the importance of acquiring each customer will become greater 
competition for healthcare information systems 
the market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
idx believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and product offerings  the features and capabilities of the systems  the price of system and product offerings  the ongoing support for the systems  and the potential for enhancements and future compatible products 
some of the idx s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than idx  and some of its competitors offer products that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include cerner corporation  eclipsys corporation  mckesson hboc  inc and shared medical systems corporation  which was acquired by siemans ag in  each of which offers a suite of products that compete with many of idx s products 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing products 
many of idx s competitors have also announced or introduced internet strategies that will compete with idx s internet applications and services 
idx may be unable to compete successfully against these organizations 
in addition  idx expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
product liability claims 
any failure by idx s products that provide applications relating to patient medical histories and treatment plans could expose idx to product liability claims 
these potential claims may exceed idx s current insurance coverage 
unsuccessful claims could be costly to defend and divert management time and resources 
in addition  idx cannot make assurances that it will continue to have appropriate insurance available to it in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
key personnel 
the success of idx is dependent to a significant degree on its key management  sales  marketing  and technical personnel 
to be successful idx must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including programmers  consultants  systems architects skilled in the technical environments in which idx s products operate 
competition for such personnel in the software and information services industries is intense 
idx does not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of its executives 
not all idx personnel have executed noncompetition agreements 
government regulation 
virtually all of idx s customers and the other entities with which idx has a business relationship operate in the healthcare industry and  as a result  are subject to governmental regulation 
because idx s products and services are designed to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement systems currently in place in the united states  and because idx is pursuing a strategy of developing and marketing products and services that support its customers regulatory and compliance efforts  idx may become subject to the reach of  and liability under  these regulations 
the federal anti kickback law  among other things  prohibits the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for medicare  medicaid and certain other federal or state healthcare program patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by the federal health care programs 
violations of the federal anti kickback law may result in civil and criminal sanction and liability  including the temporary or permanent exclusion of the violator from government health programs  treble damages and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation 
if the activities of a customer of idx or other entity with which idx has a business relationship were found to constitute a violation of the federal anti kickback law and idx  as a result of the provision of products or services to such customer or entity  was found to have knowingly participated in such activities  idx could be subject to sanction or liability under such laws  including the exclusion of idx from government health programs 
as a result of exclusion from government health programs  idx customers would not be permitted to make any payments to idx 
the federal civil false claims act and the medicare medicaid civil money penalties regulations prohibit  among other things  the filing of claims for services that were not provided as claimed  which were for services that were not medically necessary  or which were otherwise false or fraudulent 
violations of these laws may result in civil damages  including treble and civil penalties 
in addition the medicare medicaid and other federal statutes provide for criminal penalties for such false claims 
if  as a result of the provision by idx of products or services to its customers or other entities with which idx has a business relationship  idx provides assistance with the provision of inaccurate financial reports to the government under these regulations  or idx is found to have knowingly recorded or reported data relating to inappropriate payments made to a healthcare provider  idx could be subject to liability under these laws 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa contains provisions regarding standardization  privacy  security  and administrative simplification in healthcare 
as a result of regulations now proposed under hipaa  idx will make investments to support customer operations in areas  such as 
electronic data transactions  
computer system security  and 
patient privacy 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of all regulations under hipaa  idx has made and expects to continue to make investments in product enhancements to support customer operations that are regulated by hipaa 
responding to hipaa s impact may require idx to make investments in new products or charge higher prices 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with any new legislation or regulation 
the united states food and drug administration has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  idx  as a manufacturer of such products  could be required  depending on the product  to 
register and list its products with the fda  
notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on 
the market before marketing such products  or obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing a product 
depending on the intended use of a device  the fda could require idx to obtain extensive data from clinical studies to demonstrate safety or effectiveness  or substantial equivalence 
if the fda requires this data  idx would be required to obtain approval of an investigational device exemption before undertaking clinical trials 
clinical trials can take extended periods of time to complete 
idx cannot provide assurances that the fda will approve or clear a device after the completion of such trials 
in addition  these products would be subject to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act s general controls  including those relating to good manufacturing practices and adverse experience reporting 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy with regard to computer software  idx expects that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft is finalized or changed 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions like service investigation  approval  labeling and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
system errors and warranties 
idx s healthcare information systems are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  idx s healthcare information systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
idx s healthcare information systems are intended to provide information to healthcare providers for use in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of idx s products may have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
failure of an idx customer s system to perform in accordance with its documentation could constitute a breach of warranty and require idx to incur additional expense in order to make the system comply with the documentation 
if such failure is not timely remedied  it could constitute a material breach under a contract allowing the client to cancel the contract and subject idx to liability 
potential infringement of proprietary rights of others 
if any of idx s products violate third party proprietary rights  idx may be required to reengineer its products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering its products without substantial reengineering 
any efforts to reengineer idx s products or obtain licenses from third parties may not be successful  in which case idx may be forced to stop selling the infringing product or remove the infringing functionality or feature 
idx may also become subject to damage awards as a result of infringing the proprietary rights of others  which could cause idx to incur additional losses and have an adverse impact on its financial position 
idx does not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technologies used in its products infringe patents held by others 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
limited protection of proprietary technology 
idx s success and competitiveness are dependent to a significant degree on the protection of its proprietary technology 
idx relies primarily on a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect its proprietary technology 
despite these precautions  others may be able to copy or reverse engineer aspects of idx s products  to obtain and use information that idx regards as proprietary or to independently develop similar technology 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend idx s proprietary technology or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources 
conflicts of interests 
richard e 
tarrant  chief executive officer and director  and robert h 
hoehl  chairman of the board of directors  indirectly own  through various entities  real estate which idx leases in connection with its operations

risks associated with acquisition strategy 
idx intends to continue to grow in part through either acquisitions of complementary products  technologies and businesses or alliances with complementary businesses 
idx may not be successful in these acquisitions or alliances  or in integrating any such acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses into its current business and operations 
factors which may affect idx s ability to expand successfully include 
the generation of sufficient financing to fund potential acquisitions and alliances  
the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses  
effective integration and operation of the acquired or aligned products  technologies or businesses despite technical difficulties  geographic limitations and personnel issues  and 
overcoming significant competition for acquisition and alliance opportunities from companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
strategic alliance with allscripts healthcare solutions 
in january  idx entered into a ten year strategic alliance with allscripts healthcare solutions to cooperatively develop  market and sell integrated clinical and practice management products

also  pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement  idx has guaranteed that allscripts will have gross revenues resulting from the alliance less any commissions paid to idx of at least million for fiscal year  and idx will have to pay allscripts the excess  if any  of million over allscripts actual gross revenues for fiscal year if the strategic alliance is not successful  allscripts gross revenues for fiscal year are less than million  or the restrictions placed on idx during the term of the strategic alliance prohibit idx from successfully marketing and selling certain products and services  idx s operating results may suffer 
relationship with webmd corporation 
on june   idx entered into an agreement with webmd corporation pursuant to which webmd agreed to provide electronic transaction services to idx 
webmd also entered into an agreement with channelhealth incorporated  which at such time was a majority owned subsidiary of idx  pursuant to which webmd agreed to provide electronic transaction services and content to channelhealth 
webmd has informed idx that it believes neither idx nor channelhealth will be able to perform their obligations to webmd as a result of the acquisition of channelhealth by allscripts and idx s resulting ten year strategic alliance with allscripts 
webmd also indicated that it will seek to restructure its relationship with idx 
idx and webmd are currently discussing such proposal 
there can be no assurance that idx and webmd will reach an agreement relating to restructuring their relationship 
if they do not reach an agreement  webmd may claim that idx is in breach of the june agreement 
if idx and webmd agree to restructure their relationship  the restructured relationship with webmd may be less beneficial to idx  which could cause idx s operating results to suffer 
restrictions on liquidation of investment in allscripts healthcare solutions 
in january idx received approximately million shares of common stock of allscripts healthcare solutions in connection with the acquisition by allscripts of idx s majority owned subsidiary  channelhealth incorporated 
idx entered into a stock rights and restrictions agreement with allscripts  pursuant to which  among other things  idx agreed to restrictions on the sale of its shares of allscripts common stock 
in general  idx is prohibited from selling any shares for one year after the date of allscripts acquisition of channelhealth  and after one year  idx is prohibited from selling more than of it shares of allscripts common stock in any one year  and in any one month 
the restrictions on idx s ability to sell shares of allscripts common stock will make it difficult for idx to liquidate its investment in allscripts and may adversely affect the value of such investment 
anti takeover defenses 
idx s second amended and restated articles of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain certain anti takeover provisions  which could deter an unsolicited offer to acquire idx 
for example  idx s board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which will be elected at each annual meeting 
these provisions may delay or prevent a change in control of idx

fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that may experience a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
