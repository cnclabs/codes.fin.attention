item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a national assisted living company operating assisted living residences and providing assisted living services in states 
our growth in recent years has had a significant impact on our results of operations and is an important factor in explaining the changes in our results between and as of december  and  we operated or managed and residences with aggregate capacity of approximately  and  and residents  respectively 
we  together with other parties who have purchased interests in some of our development residences  were also constructing additional residences with additional capacity for residents as of december  during  we generated operating revenue of million and realized an operating loss of million and a pretax loss of million prior to non recurring charges  extraordinary item  and a loss on disposal 
in light of our current liquidity situation  we are seeking to implement a restructuring plan that contemplates the disposition of a significant portion of our residences and the restructuring of our senior indebtedness  leases both operating and synthetic  convertible debentures  joint venture arrangements and equity capitalization 
the pending restructuring plan  and recent developments impacting our liquidity and operating results  are summarized under the caption business recent developments  which is incorporated in this item by this reference 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  residence service fees 
residence service fees for year ended december  were million representing an increase of million  or  from the million for the comparable period 
substantially all of this increase resulted from occupancy growth at certain of our recently opened residences and the addition of newly constructed residences  residences we acquired and a portfolio wide growth in occupancy 
we operated or managed and residences at december  and  respectively 
other revenues 
other revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million over the million of other revenue for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to reduced development activity which resulted in lower development fees and management fees on residences which were either managed for third parties or for entities in which we held a minority ownership position

management fees include charges for transitional services to recruit and train staff  initial and recurring fees for use of our name and branding  initial and recurring fees for use of our methodologies  services for assisting with finance processing  and ongoing management services provided to operate the residence 
residence operating expenses

operating expenses as a percentage of resident service fees for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
this percentage increase resulted primarily from increases in labor and employee benefit related costs due to increased competition for personnel and increases in liability insurance costs which resulted from the most recent liability insurance policy renewal on july  the increase in marginal expenses was also impacted by a slower lease up of residences in some areas of the country 
lease expense 
lease expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the comparable period in such increase was primarily attributable to the incurrence of a full year of lease expense in related to leases entered into in lease income 
we earned million of lease income for year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in  on residences owned or leased by us and leased or subleased to unconsolidated joint ventures 
lease payment obligations of the unconsolidated joint venture entities are generally equivalent to the debt service payable by us on the leased residences  and thereby offset our costs associated with obtaining and maintaining financing for such residences 
general and administrative expense 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million prior to million of non recurring expenses  compared to million before a million write off for failed acquisitions  corporate downsizing  and corporate office relocation costs for the comparable period  representing a decrease to of operating revenue in from in the million of non recurring expenses consist of million related to employee severance costs and the termination of several internal software development and systems projects associated with our corporate downsizing  and a million bad debt expense related to a management fee note which was deemed to be uncollectible due to the acquisition of the related residences in the second quarter 
loss on disposal 
during the year ended december   the company s board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of residences with aggregate capacity of  residents and parcels of land 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  we recorded a loss on disposal on of the residences where we estimated net sales proceeds using undiscounted cashflows  net of disposal costs  are less than the book value by million net of subsequent gains 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million  or  from the million of depreciation and amortization for the comparable period 
this increase resulted primarily from depreciation of fixed assets on the larger number of new residences that were owned by us during the year ended december   versus the comparable period in in addition  we acquired residences with a capacity for residents in december and january which were previously leased by us from a healthcare reit and have therefore incurred depreciation on these assets 
non recurring charge 
a non recurring charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to severance of various general and administrative positions of million  the termination of a management contract of million and the discontinuance of our pharmacy joint venture of million  representing a decrease of million  compared to a non recurring charge of million in to exit development activities

this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of mortgage financing used in as compared to the period also includes fees paid related to amending bank agreements 
we capitalized million of interest expense in the period compared to million in the period 
this decrease in capitalized interest is a result of our decision to reduce development and construction activity in our average construction in progress balance was million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million in the period 
interest income for the period was million as compared to million for the period 
this increase was due to interest on additional restricted cash balances in place in related primarily to lease financing transactions 
amortization of financing costs 
amortization of financing costs for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million from the million of amortized financing costs for the comparable period 
this increase resulted primarily from amortization of financing costs on the larger number of residences that were owned by us during the year ended december   versus the comparable period in in addition  we completed the equity transaction totaling million in and have begun to amortize the million of related costs

equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for the twelve months ended december   was million  representing an increase of million from million of losses for the comparable period 
in the fourth quarter of  we began reducing our reliance on joint venture arrangements 
as such  our joint venture partners have not made substantial capital contributions to a number of joint ventures for several quarters 
therefore  we have absorbed the losses of those unconsolidated joint ventures in excess of capital contributed by the joint venture partner 
the increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates was also impacted by a slower lease up of residences which are held in unconsolidated joint ventures 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from million for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the maturity in the residences that were owned by us in consolidated joint venture arrangements during the period 
throughout  we had an average of residences held in consolidated joint venture relationships compared to an average of residences in consolidated joint venture relationships during the year ended december  extraordinary item 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million net of tax relating to our retirement of million of convertible debt related to the equity transaction 
eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  requires recognition of a gain or loss by the debtor for early extinguishment of debt

during the first quarter of we incurred a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million relating to the adoption of statement of position  which requires that costs of start up activities and organization costs be expensed as incurred 
income taxes 
for the period ended december   we recorded a current state income tax provision of  and a deferred tax provision of million resulting in a total income tax provision of million before the effect of the extraordinary item 
the income tax expense for the period ended december  reflects the treatment of pik interest as non deductible interest 
we do not currently anticipate that the interest expense which we will incur in the future related to the pik debentures will be deductible for income tax purposes 
during the period ended december   we recorded a current income tax benefit of  and recognized a million deferred asset resulting in a current income tax benefit of million before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million 
as of december   our deferred tax asset was reduced to zero 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we are required to continuously evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the criteria that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes will be recoverable through future taxable income 
this evaluation is made based on our internal projections which are routinely updated to reflect more recent operating trends 
based on our current financial projections  we are uncertain that we will recover these net deferred tax assets through future taxable income 
in addition  the utilization of the million net operating loss nol carryforward could be subject to limitations based on the change of control provisions in the internal revenue code 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the entire net deferred tax assets 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  residence service fees 
residence service fees for the year ended december  were million representing an increase of million  or  from the million for substantially all of this increase resulted from the addition of newly constructed residences  residences we acquired the majority ownership interest in during  and other residences we acquired

we recorded lease income on residences we owned and leased to unconsolidated joint ventures of million for the year ended  versus million for under this arrangement  we retain ownership in underlying assets in order to allow the use of our corporate financing arrangements 
lease payment obligations of the unconsolidated joint venture entities are approximately equivalent to the debt service payable by us on the leased residences  which thereby  offset our costs associated with retaining ownership in the fixed assets 
as of december   we had unconsolidated joint ventures compared to as of december  general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million prior to a write off of million for failed acquisitions  corporate downsizing  and corporate office relocation costs compared to million for  representing an increase as a percentage of operating revenue to in from in the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to salaries  related payroll taxes and employee benefits for additional corporate personnel retained to support our growth and to support the increased number of unconsolidated residences we manage 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million prior to a  write off due to the relocation of our national headquarters  representing an increase of  or  from the million of depreciation and amortization for this increase resulted primarily from depreciation of fixed assets on the larger number of new residences that were operated by us during the year ended december   versus the increase in depreciation is partially offset by the elimination of amortization on pre opening costs which are now expensed when they are incurred 
depreciation and amortization in includes million of amortization of pre opening costs 
as discussed below  we adopted a new accounting principle related to pre opening costs on january  non recurring charge 
we recorded a non recurring charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decision to exit development activities 
the charge consists of the write off of million in costs already incurred on development projects that will not be completed and the establishment of million in reserves for costs related to exiting these activities 
in addition  the charge includes a million reserve for employee costs and lease obligations associated with closing down our construction subsidiary and related activities at the national office

minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december  was million  representing a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in the number of residences in various stages of lease up that we owned in majority owned joint venture arrangements 
throughout  we had an average of residences held in these majority owned joint venture arrangements compared to an average of residences held in similar majority owned joint venture arrangements during the year ended december  income taxes 
for  we recorded a current income tax benefit of  and recognized a million deferred asset resulting in a current income tax benefit of million before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle

approximately million of this financing was used to repay bridge financing and million was used to repurchase residences from a reit lessor 
the remaining conventional financing was used to fund construction of our remaining unopened residences 
on may   we completed the first closing of the equity transaction pursuant to which we issued million of convertible debentures and convertible preferred shares to investors 
the securities issued include i million of series a  series b and series c convertible debentures with an original conversion price of per share and a semi annual pik coupon and a seven year maturity  and ii million of series a convertible preferred shares with an original conversion price of per share and a semi annual cumulative pik dividend and a mandatory redemption in seven years

the series b debentures are convertible at any time at the respective holder s option into non voting series b preferred shares having rights other than voting rights substantially similar to the company s common stock 
as a result of our issuance of a stock purchase warrant in connection with bridge financing we obtained in march  the conversion price for these securities has been reduced from to per share pursuant to the anti dilution provisions of these securities 
the company may call the debentures and the series a preferred shares at any time after may   if the company s common stock trades at an average price of at least per share for the preceding trading day period 
on august   we issued an additional million of series b debentures resulting in an aggregate transaction amount of million

we used the proceeds from this transaction  net of million in transaction costs  to i repay million of bridge loans previously funded by an affiliated group who participated as investors in the equity transaction  ii retire outstanding convertible debt with a book basis of million in exchange for million in new series c convertible debentures  iii acquire equity interests in residences resident capacity previously managed by the company for million  iv acquire a ownership interest in the operations of residences  resident capacity for million  v repay million of short term borrowings under a bank line of credit  and vi provide funds for working capital and other corporate purposes  including funding construction of our remaining unopened residences 
historically  we financed our operations and growth through a combination of various forms of real estate financing mortgage  synthetic lease and sale leaseback financing  capital contributions from joint venture partners and the sale of our securities common stock  preferred stock and convertible debentures and  to a lesser extent  cash from operations 
at december   we had billion of outstanding debt principally consisting of million of convertible debentures having a weighted average interest rate of  million of fixed rate debt having a weighted average interest rate of  capitalized lease obligations of million having a weighted average interest rate of  million of variable rate debt having a weighted average interest rate of and short term borrowings of approximately million 
through december   we have also entered into approximately million of sale leaseback and synthetic lease financings 
in addition  we have guaranteed an aggregate of million of indebtedness of joint venture and other off balance sheet third party entities 
as of december   our current portion of long term debt and short term notes payable totaled million 
these current maturities include million of debt and lease obligations that are in default 
in addition  our long term debt instruments include maturities of million in the first quarter of we  together with manor care  inc  have also guaranteed million of indebtedness of a joint venture arrangement that will mature in the second quarter of in  our scheduled debt maturities include million of secured debt and our convertible subordinated debentures  which have an outstanding balance of million at december  and mature in december as of january   we have the following series of redeemable preferred stock and convertible subordinated debentures outstanding million aggregate principal amount of series a cumulative convertible preferred shares due may  the holders of these convertible preferred shares are entitled to cumulative pay in kind pik dividends at the rate of per annum  payable semi annually in the form of additional shares of series a preferred stock on january and july of each year commencing on january  the conversion price is per share

the outstanding debentures  debentures and debentures collectively  the original debentures are subordinated to all other indebtedness of the company  and the series a debentures  the series b debentures and the series c debentures collectively  the pik debentures  and together with the original debentures  the subordinated debentures are subordinated to all indebtedness of the company other than the original debentures 
as a result of several notices of default received by the company with respect to other indebtedness that  by its terms  may be accelerated by the applicable lenders  neither we nor the applicable indenture trustees for the subordinated debentures are permitted by the subordination provisions of the indentures governing the respective subordinated debentures to make any payment or distribution on account of the subordinated debentures other than the payment of pik coupons on the pik debentures 
in the event that the company is dissolved  liquidated or reorganized  all amounts due in payment of the company s other indebtedness must be paid or provided for before any payment may be made on account of the subordinated debentures 
accordingly  unless and until we are able to restructure our debt and lease obligations and resolve all these pending defaults  we will not be permitted to make any interest or other payments to the holders of the subordinated debentures other than the payment of pik coupons on the pik debentures 
our principal credit and financing agreements  including our convertible debentures and our synthetic lease agreements  include cross default provisions that provide that a material default under our other credit facilities constitute a default under that credit or financing agreement 
accordingly  any material default arising under one of our credit or financing agreements could result in many of our other major credit and financing arrangements being in default 
in addition  our principal credit agreements and debt instruments include various financial covenants and other restrictions  including i fixed charge coverage requirements  typically measured on a trailing four quarter basis and which generally increase over the term of the applicable credit agreement  ii maximum leverage ratios which limit our aggregate senior indebtedness to total capitalization  iii various minimum net worth or tangible net worth requirements  iv in some cases  property specific debt service coverage requirements and similar financial covenants of the type referenced above applicable to individual properties or to the pool of residences financed by the applicable lender  and v the maintenance of operating and other reserves for the benefit of the residences serving as collateral for the applicable lender 
additionally  under some of our credit and sale leaseback facilities we are required to secure lender or lessor consent prior to engaging in mergers  business combinations or change in control transactions 
we are obligated under our existing joint venture arrangements to purchase the equity interests of our joint venture partners at fair market value upon the election of our partners the put 
we may also exercise options to purchases these same joint venture interests either at uncapped fair market value in the case of certain joint venture arrangements the fmv call or at an agreed upon return on investment in the case of other arrangements the formula call 
for joint ventures with the fmv call  we estimate that the amount required as of december  to acquire these joint venture interests would have been approximately million 
we do not anticipate that we will purchase or be required to purchase the interests in these partnerships with fmv calls during the next months 
with respect to joint ventures which include formula calls  we estimate that the call price as of december  would have totaled approximately million 
however  we believe that the fair market value of these residences  in the aggregate  should the put be exercised  is substantially less 
the majority of the residences held in joint venture arrangements are currently in the lease up process 
related to our restructuring plan  we are negotiating with certain of our joint venture partners to purchase or acquire their joint venture interests at terms different from the existing agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the acquisition of all of the remaining joint venture interests representing approximately of the equity interests not previously acquired by us in the equity transaction in partnerships operating of our residences 
our operations and remaining construction activity will require significant additional capital resources in the future in order to fund i our costs associated with completing construction of assisted living and alzheimer s care residences  ii our purchase from the third party joint venture partners of minority and majority equity interests in assisted living residences operated by us  iii our ongoing debt service obligations  including maturities of our long term debt and refinancing of short term debt  and iv our obligation to finance the operations of third party development partners 
we are also subject to contingent liabilities associated with certain pending litigation see item of part i of this report 
additionally  growth in residence operating cash flow has been slower than projected as a result of i increased operating costs  including labor  utilities and liability insurance and  ii to a lesser extent  slower fill rates in our pre stabilized residences and reduction in occupancy levels in certain of our stabilized residences 
as a result of on going operating losses and these upcoming capital needs  we expect that our projected cash needs during and will exceed our projected identified cash resources 
to satisfy these cash shortfalls to preserve the integrity of our operations  we are pursuing a restructuring plan which seeks to  among other things  dispose of a significant number of our residences which operate with cash shortfalls and defer some of our debt service obligations until those disposition and restructuring transactions can occur see business recent developments 
in an effort to retain sufficient cash to fund operations of all our residences and address our short term liquidity needs  in march we obtained a million bridge loan provided by certain of our principal stock and convertible debenture holders the bridge loan and elected not to fund certain of our debt service and lease payment obligations 
as a result  we are currently in default under many of our credit and sale leaseback facilities 
the million bridge loan has a six month term  is secured by first mortgages on several residences and bears interest at an escalating interest rate  commencing at per annum 
at our option  the bridge loan may be extended by an additional six months whereupon the bridge loan will become convertible into convertible subordinated debentures of the company having rights and terms substantially similar to our series b pay in kind convertible debentures  but having a conversion price equal to per share of series b preferred stock a common stock equivalent price of per share or  if during the original six month term of the bridge loan we have sold any shares of common stock or series b preferred stock at a higher price per share  such higher price per share 
the bridge lenders also are entitled to participate in any transaction involving the issuance by the company of equity or equity linked securities during the term of the bridge loan 
as an inducement to make the bridge loan  we issued the bridge lenders stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of a newly designated class of our preferred stock having rights and terms substantially similar to our series b non voting participating preferred stock issuable upon conversion of our series b debentures 
like our series b preferred stock  each share of the new preferred stock has rights  other than voting rights  substantially similar to shares of common stock of the company 
accordingly   shares of the new preferred stock represent million common stock equivalent shares 
the five year warrants are exercisable at a price of per share for  shares of the new preferred stock  per share for  shares of the new preferred stock and per share for  shares of the new preferred stock 
pursuant to the anti dilution provisions operative in the million of outstanding convertible pay in kind debentures and preferred stock that we originally issued in may and august  upon the issuance of these warrants the conversion price for these debentures and preferred shares decreased from to per share of common stock 
we elected not to fund certain of our debt service and lease payment obligations due in march specifically  without the consent or waiver of the applicable lendor or lessor  we failed to pay march debt service to lenders who hold mortgages on residences  resident capacity and we failed to make rental payments under operating or synthetic lease arrangements to lessors who hold title to residences  resident capacity 
we have received written notices of default from most of these lenders or lessors  one lessor has terminated leases for residences resident capacity and other lenders have elected to apply deposits and reserve funds of ours held by such lenders against the past due payments as well as activating cash traps of bank accounts relating to the operation of residences mortgaged to such lenders as permitted under such lenders loan documents 
we expect that other notices of default will be forthcoming and that absent an agreed upon resolution  other lenders may also begin exercising remedies under their loan documents and realization upon collateral 
at the present time  however  we are not aware that any foreclosure actions have commenced against any of our owned residences 
we further anticipate that we will not make april payments to many of such lenders or lessors and such non payment may continue in certain instances until the asset disposition has been completed 
in addition  we did not fund the march lease payment on the synthetic lease for our headquarters 
the lessor has declared a lease default  both the lessor and the lessor s mortgagee have demanded that we purchase the headquarters for the full lease balance  and the lessor has realized on deposits held as security for payment of the lease balance 
we presently are discussing short term financing with the landlord s mortgagee for the remaining million lease balance 
we sought forbearance agreements from certain of our lenders and lessors with respect to march debt service and lease payments  but did not have written agreements in place with most of our lenders and lessors at the time these payments were due  nor do we expect such agreements to be in place with respect to most of our debt service and lease payments due in april as we did not make loan and lease payments to these lenders and lessors in march  we are now in default with respect to these obligations 
management believes that  despite the pendency of these defaults  during the near term the majority of these lenders and lessors will continue to participate in restructuring discussions with us 
no assurances may be given  however  that this will be the case 
as our principal credit  lease and other financing facilities are cross defaulted to a material default occurring under other credit  lease or financing facilities  a payment default under one such facility could result in our being in default under many other such facilities  which could adversely affect our ability to restructure without reorganization proceedings 
to address our long term liquidity and capital needs  including our upcoming debt maturities  we intend to i develop a restructuring plan with our lenders  lessors  convertible debenture holders and joint venture partners  ii continue to implement operating initiatives focused on overall rate and occupancy improvement and overhead reductions  iii dispose of under performing and non strategic residences in order to reduce associated financing costs  operating expenses and to generate cash  and iv seek to identify additional equity or equity linked capital 
we have retained silverman consulting and cohen steers capital advisors to help develop and implement our restructuring plan 
a summary description of our restructuring plan is included under the caption business recent developments  and is incorporated in this section by this reference 
while we are attempting to negotiate the terms of a restructuring of our principal obligations with our lenders  lessors  holders of subordinated debentures and joint venture partners outside of a reorganization proceeding under the bankruptcy code  it may be necessary for us to seek to reorganize pursuant to the provisions of chapter of the bankruptcy code if we conclude that we need to avail ourselves of the substantive and procedural provisions of a court supervised reorganization 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on us 
inflation could  however  affect our results of operations due to our dependence on our senior resident population who rely on liquid assets and relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
as a result  we may not be able to increase residence service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring our fees  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures 
in addition  given the significant amount of construction and development activity which we anticipate  inflationary pressures could affect our cost of new product deployment and financing 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we performed a sensitivity analysis which presents the hypothetical change in fair value of those financial instruments held by us at december  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from an immediate hypothetical one percentage point parallel shift in the yield curve 
the fair value of the debt included in the analysis is million 
although not expected  a one percentage point change in the interest rates would have caused our annual interest expense to change by approximately million 
accordingly  a significant increase in london inter bank offered rate libor could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
although a majority of the debt and lease payment obligations we have as of or during the twelve months ended december   are not subject to floating interest rates  indebtedness that we may incur in the future may bear interest at a floating rate 
debt and annual operating lease payment obligations will continue to increase significantly as we complete our pending construction activity 
we do not presently use financial derivative instruments to manage our interest costs 
we do not use foreign currency exchange rate forward contracts or commodity contracts and do not have foreign currency exposure as of december
