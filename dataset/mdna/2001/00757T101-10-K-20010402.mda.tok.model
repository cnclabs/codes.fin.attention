item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes 
overview in june  we completed an agreement under which we would develop and manufacture products and systems for use in deep brain stimulation dbs for sofamor danek 
see note product development agreement of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we received a payment of million upon execution of the agreement that was being recognized into income as revenue based upon the estimated completion of the development project 
during the year ended december   we recognized million into income as revenue 
the remaining  was recognized into income as revenue during january due to the termination of the agreement with sofamor danek as a result of the merger of sofamor danek and medtronic  inc in connection with the termination  we also received an additional payment of million from sofamor danek  which was recognized into income as revenue during january the former agreement with sofamor danek fit with our strategy to strengthen and broaden our neuromodulation technology platforms and to ally ourselves with strategic partners who can help us leverage ans core technology into other significant market segments beyond our focus on the chronic pain segment of the neuromodulation market 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in negotiating and consummating research and development agreements with other strategic partners 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  on january   we completed the acquisition of the assets of implantable devices limited partnership and esox technology holdings  llc and the acquisition by merger of hi tronics designs  inc see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
because these acquisitions were completed subsequent to the fiscal year  their results of operations and balance sheet data are not included in the company s financial information but will be reflected in the results of the company for the three months ended march  also subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  on february   the fda notified us that it had denied our petition to reclassify totally implanted spinal cord stimulators ipgs for treatment of pain of the trunk and or limbs from a class iii device to a class ii device 
the fda s denial was surprising and disappointing principally because at a presubmission meeting with the fda  the agency itself had recommended that ans submit a reclassification petition instead of the pre market approval pma process as a least burdensome path to market 
an fda advisory panel also recommended the reclassification and the agency itself had supported the panel recommendation as late as september  we are currently requesting an appeal of the decision  while simultaneously pursuing the pma process to gain approval to market the ipg in the united states 
we are marketing the ipg product in europe 
industry analysts estimate that the ipg market for spinal cord stimulation to treat pain of the trunk and or limbs will approach million in  and that the market is growing at a to annual rate 
currently in the united states  medtronic  inc is the sole provider of ipgs 
page results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and we reported net earnings of  or 
per diluted share in compared to million or 
per diluted share in net earnings for the period benefited from million of revenue recorded in connection with our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
total net revenue of million for the year ended december   was million below the comparable level of million due to million of net revenue in the period associated with our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
excluding the development agreement revenue  net revenue from ans product sales increased percent to million during compared to million in this increase in net revenue from product sales was the result of higher unit sales volume  primarily in the united states  of ans radio frequency stimulation systems used to treat complex pain patterns 
because neuromodulation devices have gained acceptance as a viable  efficacious and cost effective treatment alternative for relieving chronic intractable pain and improving neurological function  we are continuing our efforts to expand our product offerings in the high growth market of neuromodulation 
today  ans is a market share and technology leader in the million radio frequency stimulation segment of the neuromodulation market 
during and  to position ourselves to participate in the other larger and more rapidly growing segments of the neuromodulation market  we continued to aggressively invest in development projects  including our ipg for spinal cord stimulation  ipg for deep brain stimulation and a fully implantable constant rate infusion pump 
we plan to continue these efforts in gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue from product sales discussed above 
gross profit margin from product sales remained approximately the same at percent in the period compared to percent in the period 
total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in  while as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  decreased to percent in from percent in research and development expense decreased to million in  or percent of net revenue from product sales  from million during  or percent of net revenue from product sales 
this decrease in the absolute dollar amount in compared to was the result of lower consulting expense 
during  these expenditures were directed toward development of our ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation  our next generation radio frequency stimulation systems  our proprietary fully implantable constant rate infusion pump and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation 
we received ce mark approval for our ipg stimulation system and began our market launch into the european markets in the first quarter of we also received ce mark approval on our proprietary fully implantable constant rate infusion pump and expect to launch it in the european market during the second quarter of in the united states  we have received the necessary clearance from the fda to initiate clinical trials for our fully implantable constant rate infusion pump and initiated the trials during the first quarter of we are currently preparing our pma submission for the fda following the february  denial of our petition for reclassification of this ipg 
page marketing expense  as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  decreased from percent in to percent in  while the absolute dollar amount increased from million during to million in this dollar increase during was attributable to higher commission expense from increased product sales and a change from distributors to commissioned sales agents in certain united states territories  higher expense for education and training of new implanters and higher convention expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million during from million in while as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  decreased to percent in from percent during the increase of  in absolute dollar expense during was principally the result of higher property tax and investor relation expenses 
amortization of ans intangibles increased slightly to million in from million during due to expense for additional patents we have licensed 
other income decreased to  in compared to  in primarily as a result of a lower interest income due to lower funds available for investment 
income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to  in from million in due to lower earnings from ans operations as the period included the million termination payment from our former development agreement with sofamor danek 
this represents effective tax rates of percent in and percent in our expense for amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes  and  when combined with a provision for state taxes  results in the higher effective tax rate during both and compared to the us statutory rate for corporations of percent

net revenue from ans product sales increased percent to million during compared to million in this increase in net revenue from product sales was the result of higher unit sales volume of ans radio frequency stimulation systems used to treat complex pain patterns 
all of the million increase in was the result of higher sales in the united states 
during june  we launched our enhanced radio frequency stimulation system  the renew system  in the united states 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in due to the increase in net revenue from product sales discussed above 
gross profit margin from product sales decreased to percent in compared to percent in due to approximately  of additional costs we incurred from product transition and unexpected lower manufacturing yields related to the renew system during the third quarter of  higher component costs for the renew system  and production downtime associated with our move to our new leased facility in may page total operating expenses the aggregate of research and development  marketing  amortization of intangibles and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and as a percentage of net revenue from product sales increased to percent in from percent in research and development expense increased to million in  or percent of net revenue from product sales  from million during  or percent of net revenue from product sales  reflecting our stepped up commitment to develop products that will expand our presence into other rapidly growing segments of the neuromodulation market 
this increase during compared to was the result of higher salary and benefit expense from staffing additions  increased consulting expense  and higher test material expense 
these expenditures during were directed toward development of our renew system  which we launched in the united states during june  a fully implantable constant rate infusion pump  an ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation and an ipg stimulation system for deep brain stimulation

liquidity and capital resources at december  our working capital increased to million from million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to at december  cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and marketable securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  page in and  the board of directors authorized stock repurchases of up to  shares 
during and  we repurchased  shares under the authorized repurchase programs at an aggregate cost of million 
we made no repurchases during in november  in connection with signing the agreement to acquire hi tronics designs  inc in a stock for stock merger  the board of directors rescinded the share repurchase program under which  shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase 
during the three years ended december   we issued   and  shares respectively  from our treasury upon the exercise of stock options and a warrant 
at december    shares remained in the treasury 
on january   we issued  shares from the treasury for the purchase of the assets of esox corporation and issued the remaining  shares from the treasury as part of the  shares we issued to acquire hi tronics designs  inc we decreased our investment in inventories to million at december   from million at december  we estimate that our investment in inventory will also decrease by year end by approximately  to a level of million 
we spent million during for capital expenditures and license fees for additional patents and intellectual property we are licensing 
of such expenditures  approximately  was spent for manufacturing tooling and equipment primarily for the new products we developed including our ipg system for spinal cord stimulation and our fully implantable constant rate infusion pump 
we also spent  during to license additional patents and intellectual property 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund all of our operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
cash flows net cash provided by continuing operations was million in  million in and million in this decrease of approximately  in compared to related to the decrease in net earnings from million in to  in due to including the million termination payment from our former development agreement with sofamor danek in the results 
in  we used million of cash to increase our investment in assets such as accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and to reduce our accounts payable and income taxes payable 
although net earnings from continuing operations increased to million in from million in  net cash provided from continuing operations decreased by million primarily due to changes in components of working capital 
during  we used cash to increase our investment in assets such as inventories  account receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and to reduce our income taxes payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in while investing activities provided cash of  in and million in during  we used million for capital expenditures related to additional manufacturing tooling and equipment for new products we developed and licensing fees for patents 
we also used in the period a net of million for the purchase of investments in certificates of deposit with maturities over days and investment grade municipal bonds with maturities less than one year from the date we purchased them 
the period reflects million of net proceeds we received when we sold our facility to atrion corporation 
we utilized million in for capital expenditures for leasehold improvements  furnishings and equipment for our new leased facility  manufacturing tooling and equipment for our renew system and new products we are developing  and licensing fees for patents 
the period reflects net proceeds of million from the sale of discontinued operations 
we utilized million in for capital expenditures  primarily for manufacturing tooling and equipment for the new products we are developing  and license fees for patents we licensed

outlook and uncertainties the following is a safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words expect  estimate  anticipate  predict  believe  plan  will  should  intend and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements appear in a number of places in this annual report on form k and include statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations with respect to  among other things i trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations  ii our financing plans  and iii our business growth strategies 
we caution our readers that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following product development and market acceptance 
our growth depends in part on our ability to develop and gain market acceptance of new products  including next generation ans products 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop successful products  that we will not experience delays in product introduction  or that once such products are introduced  the market will accept them 
government regulation 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation  principally by the fda 
the regulatory process  especially as it relates to product approvals  can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain and may involve the satisfactory completion of clinical trials and market tests prior to the introduction of new products 
failure to obtain government approval of our products on a timely and cost efficient basis  including the approval of our ipg stimulation system for spinal cord stimulation  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
component supply 
we depend on various suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products  and our business depends in part on the adequacy  acceptability and timeliness of component supply 
in addition  we rely on a single supplier for the computer chip used in the receiver of our stimulation systems 
the supplier of this computer chip has indicated its desire to cease manufacturing and supplying the computer chip in the future  but to date has not determined when this will occur 
the supplier has agreed to notify us when a date has been determined and allow us to place a final one time purchase order for the computer chip 
in the interim  we are maintaining a higher than normal inventory of the computer chip and are developing a new receiver design that does not use a custom computer chip 
a sudden disruption in supply from the computer chip supplier or another single source supplier could adversely affect our ability to deliver finished products on time 
page competition and technological change 
the medical device market is highly competitive 
we compete with larger companies that have access to greater capital  research and development  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do 
in addition  our market is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid product development and technological change  which could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
one large supplier  medtronic  inc  dominates the market for electrical stimulation systems and fully implantable infusion pumps 
intellectual property rights 
we rely in part on patents  trade secrets and proprietary technology to remain competitive 
it may be necessary to defend these rights or to defend against claims that we are infringing on the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
cost pressures on medical technology 
the overall escalating cost of medical products and healthcare results in significant cost pressure 
third party payors  such as insurance companies and hmo s  are under intense pressure to challenge the prices charged for medical products and services 
we rely heavily on medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
any amendments to existing reimbursement rules and regulations that restrict or terminate the reimbursement eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of medical procedures using our products or the eligibility or the extent or amount of coverage of our products could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential product liability 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical devices entail substantial risks of liability claims or product recalls 
reliance on major customer distributor 
during  we had one major customer that accounted for percent or more of our net revenue 
sun medical  inc  a specialty distributor of ans products  accounted for million  or percent of ans net revenue from product sales for the year ended december  while we believe our relations with sun medical are good  the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance 
although our year readiness efforts were successful and we have not experienced any year issues to date  we cannot assure you that year issues will not occur at a later date that would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
other uncertainties 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in this form k in specific contexts and in the company s other periodic sec filings 
the company is  of course  also subject to general economic risks  the risk of interruption in the source of supply  dependence on key personnel and other risks and uncertainties 
currency fluctuations substantially all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates in other countries could reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold  although we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our investments or debt instruments 
we invest our cash reserves in high quality short term liquid money market instruments with major financial institutions and in certificates of deposit 
at december   we had  invested in money market funds   in certificates of deposit with maturities less than days from the purchase date and  in certificates of deposit with maturity dates of greater than days from the purchase date 
the rate of interest earned on these investments will vary with overall market rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate earned on these investments would not have a material effect on our income or cash flows 
we also have certain investments in available for sale securities 
these investments primarily consist of investment grade municipal bonds with maturities less than one year from the date of purchase  a real estate investment trust traded on the new york stock exchange and an investment grade corporate preferred security also traded on the new york stock exchange 
the cost of these investments is  and the fair value at december  was  the investments are subject to overall stock market and interest rate risk 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the value of these investments from the prices at december  would decrease the fair value by  at december   we had no debt instruments
