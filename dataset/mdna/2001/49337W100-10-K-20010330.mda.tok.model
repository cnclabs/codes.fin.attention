ferc regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as well as certain corporate and financial activities of companies that are engaged in such activities 
the long island generating facilities and the ravenswood facility are subject to ferc regulation based on their wholesale energy transactions 
lipa  keyspan and the staff of ferc stipulated a five year rate plan for the long island generating facilities with agreed upon yearly adjustments  which has been approved by ferc 
our ravenswood facility s rates are based on a market based rate application approved by ferc 
the rates that our ravenswood facility may charge are subject to mitigation measures due to market power concerns of ferc 
ferc retains the ability in future proceedings  either on its own motion or upon a complaint filed with ferc  to modify the ravenswood facility s rates  either upward or downward  if ferc concludes that it is in the public interest to do so 
ferc also has jurisdiction to regulate certain natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce  the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  and  unless an exemption applies  companies engaged in such activities 
the natural gas distribution activities of kedny  kedli  kedne and certain related intrastate gas transportation functions are not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent that kedny  kedli  kedne purchase or sell gas for resale in interstate commerce  such transactions are subject to ferc jurisdiction and have been authorized by the ferc

we are also pursuing claims against insurance carriers and potentially responsible parties which seek the recovery of certain costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
air 
federal  state and local laws currently regulate a variety of air emissions from new and existing electric generating plants  including so  nox  opacity and particulate matter and  in the future  may also regulate emissions of fine particulate matter  hazardous air pollutants  and carbon dioxide 
we have submitted timely applications for permits in accordance with the requirements of title v of the amendments to the federal clean air act caa 
final permits have been issued for all of our electric generating facilities 
the permits allow our electric generating plants to continue to operate without any additional significant expenditures  except as described below 
our generating facilities are located within a caa severe ozone non attainment area  and are subject to the phase i  ii  and iii nox reduction requirements established under the ozone transportation commission otc memorandum of understanding 
our investments in boiler combustion modifications and the use of natural gas firing at our steam electric generating stations have enabled us to achieve the nox emission reductions required under phase i and ii in a cost effective manner 
we are awaiting final development of state and federal regulatory programs with respect to nox reduction requirements for our existing power plants 
our compliance strategy may be composed of fuel choice decisions  acquisition of emission credits  and installation of emission control equipment 
the extent of development of new generation in the region will also impact our compliance strategy 
although we are evaluating our alternatives  final decisions cannot be made until pending regulatory requirements and new generation decisions are clarified 
expenditures to address emission reduction requirements through the year are expected to be between million and million 
water 
we possess permits for our generating units which authorize discharges from cooling water circulating systems and chemical treatment systems 
these permits are renewed from time to time  as required by regulation 
additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for our power plants may be required by the dec 
until our monitoring obligations are completed and changes to the environmental protection agency regulations under section of the clean water act are promulgated  the need for and the cost of equipment upgrades cannot be determined

compliance activities associated with the acos are ongoing and are recoverable from lipa under the msa 
in addition  we will be responsible for environmental obligations relating to the ravenswood facility operations other than liabilities arising from pre closing disposal of waste at off site locations and any monetary fines arising from consolidated edison s pre closing conduct 
superfund sites 
federal and new york state superfund laws impose liability  regardless of fault  upon generators of hazardous substances for costs associated with remediating contaminated property

current period consolidated results of operations reflect the results of operations for eastern and eni for the period november  through december  as required under purchase accounting  reported results of operations for all periods prior to november  do not reflect the operating results of eastern and eni 
in  keyspan changed its fiscal year end from march to december therefore  results of operations for the period ended december  reflect the nine month transition period april  to december  the transition period 
the transition period consists of the following i the period april  through may   which reflects the results of lilco only prior to the lipa transaction and keyspan acquisition  and ii the period may  through december   which represents fully consolidated results  including the kse acquired companies  ie the brooklyn union gas company d b a keyspan energy delivery new york kedny and subsidiaries comprising the gas exploration and production  energy services and energy investment segments 
as required under purchase accounting  the results of operations for all periods prior to may  reflect results of lilco only  and do not include results of kse  since for accounting purposes  lilco acquired kse as of may  due to the change in the composition of our operations and the change in our fiscal year  both occurring in  results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to the results of operations for the years ended december  and december  also  since the transition period reflects results for the period april  through december   earnings from gas heating season operations are not reflected in transition period results 
approximately of our gas distribution related earnings  or approximately of our consolidated earnings  are realized during the months of january through march  due to the large percentage of gas heating sales to total gas sales 
since the transition period is not comparable to the years ended december  and december   we have provided operating results for the full twelve months ended december  in our discussions of operating results for each business segment

see segment review of operations combined company comparison 
the commentary that follows should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated review of results earnings summary consolidated income loss available for common stock by reporting segment is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars year ended december  april  through december  before early retirement early after early and retirement retirement and year ended before early early after early severance and severance severance december  retirement retirement retirement charges charges charges charge charge charge gas distribution       electric services       gas exploration and production      energy services      energy investments      other        consolidated        special charges  consolidated  consolidated earnings for were per share compared to per share in consolidated results for reflect a charge of million after tax  or per share  associated with early retirement and severance programs that were implemented upon the successful completion of the eastern and eni acquisitions 
excluding these charges  consolidated earnings for were per share 
our average common shares outstanding were approximately three percent lower for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a stock repurchase program in the lower shares outstanding had a favorable affect on earnings per share of approximately 
consolidated results for the transition period reflect a loss of per share 
during the transition period  we i incurred a charge of million after tax  or per share  associated with implementing an early retirement program  ii incurred substantial non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction of million after tax  or per share  principally reflecting taxes associated with the sale of assets to keyspan by lipa and the write off of certain regulatory assets that were no longer recoverable under various lipa agreements  and iii recorded an after tax non cash impairment charge of million  or per share  representing our share of the impairment charge recorded by our gas exploration and production subsidiary  the houston exploration company houston exploration to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on its valuation of proved gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  costs related to the lipa transaction and special charges for further details of these charges 
excluding these early retirement and special charges  earnings for the transition period were million  or per share 
the increase in earnings for over  and for over the transition period resulted from solid performance across all of our business segments 
further  as has been previously noted  earnings for the transition period include only seven months of results of operations for the kse acquired companies and do not reflect heating season operations months of january through march when approximately of our gas related earnings are realized 
the increase in earnings from the gas distribution segment for  compared to last year reflects revenue benefits from continued gas sales growth  favorable gas prices compared to oil prices for most of the year and earnings from our newly acquired gas distribution companies 
since the date of acquisition  the combined gas distribution operations of eastern and eni added million to consolidated earnings 
the increase in gas distribution earnings in compared to the transition period reflects  primarily the addition of kedny for a full twelve month period and earnings generated for an entire heating season 
earnings growth in both and associated with our electric service segment reflects primarily the operations associated with our investment in the  megawatt ravenswood electric generation facility  ravenswood facility located in queens  new york 
the ravenswood facility was acquired in june and therefore  earnings for reflect a full year of operations  while reflects less than seven full months of operations 
earnings from our energy services segment in were derived largely from inter company fuel procurement and energy management services provided to the ravenswood facility  as well as earnings from our recently acquired companies that provide energy related services 
consolidated earnings for compared to were further enhanced through improved performance from our gas exploration and production segment and energy investments segment 
gas exploration and production operations benefitted from significantly higher realized gas prices and increased production volumes in in addition  on march  we increased our ownership in houston exploration from to 
results of operations in reflect gas exploration and production operations for a full twelve months compared to seven months for the transition period  as well as the benefit from the combined effect of increases in both gas production volumes and gas prices 
energy investments reflect the continued development and integration of companies acquired over the past few years 
the other segment reflects preferred stock dividends  general expenses incurred by our corporate and administrative areas that have not been allocated to our various business segments  and interest income earned on temporary cash investments 
the significant increase in the loss incurred by the other segment in compared to reflects the following i additional contributions to the keyspan foundation  a not for profit philanthropic foundation that makes donations to local charitable community organizations  ii charges related to certain rate settlement issues  iii losses incurred with our investment in certain technology related activities  iv branding expenses and other charges related to the integration of the eastern and eni companies into keyspan operations  v an increase in interest expense associated with higher levels of commercial paper outstanding  and vi lower interest income on temporary cash investments 
the other segment showed a smaller loss in compared to the transition period 
transition period results reflected a donation to establish the keyspan foundation and a charge to write off a customer billing system that was in development 
revenues consolidated revenues are derived primarily from our two core operating segments gas distribution and electric services 
in  these two core segments accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues 
for consolidated revenues were billion  compared to billion for  an increase of billion or 
the increase was due primarily to i an increase in revenues from the ravenswood facility of million  ii an increase in gas distribution revenues of million  and iii an increase of million from the energy services segment 
revenues from the ravenswood facility benefitted from the sale of energy  capacity and ancillary services to the new york independent system operator nyiso at competitive market prices 
prior to the start of the nyiso on november  all of the energy and capacity from the ravenswood facility was sold to consolidated edison company of new york  inc consolidated edison on a cost recovery and fixed fee basis 
further  revenues for reflect a full year of operations 
revenues from the gas distribution segment benefitted from continued gas sales growth  favorable gas prices as compared to oil prices for most of and the acquisition of eastern s and eni s gas distribution operations 
revenues from the gas distribution segment also include recovery of gas costs  which have been significantly higher in compared to the increase in revenues from the energy services segment resulted from recent acquisitions of companies providing various energy related services throughout the new york city metropolitan area  rhode island and pennsylvania  and sales growth related to our gas and electric marketing subsidiary 
the increase in consolidated revenues of billion  or  in  compared to the transition period  reflects primarily revenues from gas heating sales 
for the months of january through march  gas distribution revenues were million 
the transition period  which reflects the period april  through december   does not include revenues from heating season operations for the months of january through march 
further  revenues in reflect a full twelve month period for all segments  whereas the transition period reflects revenues for only seven months from the kse acquired companies 
revenues in also include million of revenues from the ravenswood facility and were further enhanced through the acquisition of companies in the energy services segment 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were billion in  compared to billion last year  an increase of billion  or 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher gas and purchased fuel costs  and higher operations and maintenance expenses 
consolidated operating expenses were billion during the transition period 
the increase in operating expenses in compared to the transition period of million  or  is due  in part  to the increased reporting time frame and to an increase of million in operations and maintenance expense reflecting  primarily the addition of the kse acquired companies for a full twelve month period 
purchased gas for resale the increase in gas costs for compared to last year resulted from gas sales growth associated with our two new york gas distribution subsidiaries and our gas and electric marketing subsidiary  significantly higher gas prices  and the addition of the eastern and eni gas distribution operations which added million to gas costs in the increase in gas costs for compared to the transition period is due to changes in gas quantities and prices  and the differences in the reporting periods presented 
fluctuations in utility gas costs have little or no impact on operating results as the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred and gas cost recoveries are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
fluctuations in gas costs  however  can affect earnings of our gas and electric marketing subsidiary 
to mitigate this potential volatility  this subsidiary employs derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of the risk associated with future gas cost prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values 
fuel and purchased power fuel and purchased power expense in was million and reflects expenses associated with the operation of the ravenswood facility  as well as expenses associated with our gas and electric marketing subsidiary which has been making retail electric sales to residential  small commercial  and industrial customers since january fuel expense for the operation of the ravenswood facility was million in fuel and purchased power expense for was million and reflects expenses associated with the operation of the ravenswood facility only 
in  the prior owner of the ravenswood facility  consolidated edison  owned and supplied the fuel necessary to operate the ravenswood facility from june  until the start of the nyiso s operations on november  further  during this time  all of the energy generated by the ravenswood facility was supplied to consolidated edison 
electric fuel expense was million during the transition period 
in accordance with the energy management agreement ema between keyspan and lipa  lipa is responsible for paying directly the costs of fuel  as well as purchased power to satisfy the energy needs of lipa s customers 
as a result  since may   we no longer incur any electric fuel expense for long island generation 
operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expense increased by million or  in compared to last year  primarily as a result of i recent acquisitions of companies providing various energy related services which increased operating expenses in by  ii the operations of the ravenswood facility for a full twelve months which increased operating expenses in by  and iii the recent acquisition of eastern and eni which added million to operations and maintenance expense in further  we incurred a million charge in for early retirement and severance programs 
operations and maintenance expense increased by million or  in compared to the transition period 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of the kse acquired companies for a full twelve month period and the increased reporting time frame generally 
operations and maintenance expense for the kse acquired companies was million for and million for the transition period 
further  the increase in comparative operations and maintenance expense in was due  in part  to the operations of the ravenswood facility  which added million to expense 
operations and maintenance expense for the transition period included million of costs associated with the write off of a customer billing system that was in development and a charge of million associated with an early retirement program 
other operating expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization expense reflects primarily gas utility property and electric generation property additions  as well as depletion expense associated with our gas exploration and production activities 
property additions and gas production activities have increased in compared to  resulting in higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense also reflects goodwill amortization which increased in compared to primarily due to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of eastern and eni 
the goodwill associated with these acquisitions amounted to billion and the amortization for the period november  through december  was approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies for a description of goodwill 
the decrease in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in compared to the transition period is due primarily to the fact that houston exploration recorded an impairment charge of million in december to reduce the value of its proved gas reserves in accordance with the asset ceiling test limitations of the securities and exchange commission sec applicable to gas exploration and development operations accounted for under the full cost method 
excluding this impairment charge  depreciation expense increased in due to property additions  the addition of the kse acquired companies for a full twelve month period and the increased reporting period generally 
operating taxes principally include state and local taxes on utility revenues and property 
the applicable property base and tax rates generally have increased in all periods 
further  the increase in operating taxes in compared to is also due to a full twelve months of operations of the ravenswood facility and the addition of eastern and eni 
operating taxes for the ravenswood facility in were million compared to million in eastern and eni added million to operating taxes in the increase in operating taxes in  compared to the transition period  reflects the addition of the kse acquired companies for a full twelve month period  and operating taxes associated with the ravenswood facility 
operating taxes associated with the kse acquired companies were million in and million during the transition period 
other income and deductions other income includes equity income from subsidiaries comprising the energy investments segment  primarily our investments in canada 
in addition  other income includes interest income from temporary cash investments  certain non operating expenses and the effect on net income from the minority interest associated primarily with houston exploration 
in october  we increased our investment in gulf midstream services partnership gulf midstream  located in alberta canada  from to and renamed these operations keyspan canada 
as a result  since october the results of operations of keyspan canada have been reported on a consolidated basis and are no longer reported in equity income 
the decrease in other income in compared to reflects primarily an increase in non operating charges and lower interest income 
during we made a million donation to the keyspan foundation and recorded an impairment charge of million on our equity investment in certain technology related activities 
interest income has been decreasing as we have utilized our cash during the past two years to make acquisitions  repurchase shares of our common stock  and retire maturing debt 
other income and deductions in reflects twelve months of results for our canadian investments compared to seven months of results for the transition period 
further  our interest in gulf midstream was acquired in december and  therefore  there are no equity earnings associated with gulf midstream for the transition period 
we recognized equity earnings of million for from our canadian investments  including million from gulf midstream 
interest income decreased in  compared to the transition period  as we utilized our cash to make acquisitions  repurchase shares of our common stock  and retire maturing debt 
other income and deductions for the transition period reflects non recurring charges associated with the lipa transaction of million after tax and a million charge for the funding of the keyspan foundation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  costs related to the lipa transaction and special charges 
interest expense interest expense was million  or higher in  compared to last year reflecting higher levels of debt outstanding  primarily related to i billion of long term debt and million of commercial paper issued to finance the acquisitions of eastern and eni  ii million of medium term notes issued in february  iii debt associated with our canadian investments  as well as iv higher commercial paper borrowings to satisfy our seasonal working capital needs 
interest expense relating to the acquisition financing of eastern and eni amounted to approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to the transition period primarily reflects the then reduced level of outstanding debt resulting from the lipa transaction 
upon consummation of the lipa transaction  lipa assumed substantially all of the outstanding debt of lilco 
keyspan  in return  issued promissory notes to lipa for its continuing obligation to pay principal and interest on certain series of bonds that were assumed by lipa 
outstanding debt at december  was billion  compared to billion lilco only prior to the lipa transaction 
in addition  interest expense in also reflects the repayment of million of promissory notes due lipa that matured in june the reduction in interest expense in from the lower levels of debt outstanding was offset  in part  by the interest expense from the kse acquired companies for the full twelve months 
income taxes income tax expense generally reflects the higher level of pre tax income in compared to last year 
further  during the last quarter of  the basis for computing certain local income taxes was changed which also contributed to the increase in income tax expense in income tax expense for reflects an adjustment to deferred tax expense and current tax expense for the utilization of previously deferred net operating loss carryforwards recorded in in  we recorded  as a deferred tax asset  a benefit of million for net operating loss carryforwards 
we estimated that million of the benefits from the net operating loss carryforwards from would be realized in our consolidated federal and state income tax returns and  accordingly  we applied the net operating loss benefits in our federal and state tax provisions 
pre tax income and the related deferred income tax expense for the transition period were significantly affected by charges related to the lipa transaction  the write off of a customer billing system  charges related to the early retirement program  and the impairment charge associated with the write down of proved gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income tax 
consolidated outlook for results of operations for reflect strong results from our core investments gas distribution  electric services and energy services 
our marketing efforts have added approximately  new gas heating customers in our new york and long island service territories in  as well as contributing to our gas sales growth of approximately  after normalizing for weather variations 
our june acquisition of the ravenswood facility provided us with significant earnings enhancement 
further  our energy services operations posted positive earnings results in due to the successful integration of companies purchased during the past two years 
these operations are expected to form the basis for additional enhancements to consolidated earnings in future years 
moreover  our non core assets  specifically our gas and oil exploration and production operations  posted impressive results for for  we anticipate that consolidated earnings will grow approximately over the level we achieved in  and we forecast earnings in the range of to per share 
we believe this growth will come primarily from our energy services operations as we continue the successful integration of companies acquired during the past few years 
we also anticipate significant earnings growth from our gas and oil exploration and production activities resulting from the anticipated high price for natural gas during  augmented by our current hedging strategies 
further  we have completed our resource allocation process for and are encouraged that we will achieve the synergy savings projected to result from the eastern and eni acquisitions 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued a revision to its exposure draft ed on business combinations and intangible assets 
in the new ed  the fasb concluded that the amortization of goodwill will no longer be required 
instead  companies will need to perform yearly impairment tests on the recorded amount of goodwill and determine whether an impairment charge is necessary 
we believe the fasb will finalize its deliberations on goodwill amortization in the third or fourth quarter of  but are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of its deliberations 
if we are required to discontinue the amortization of goodwill we may realize higher earnings in  compared to our current earnings projections  although such enhancement to earnings will not affect cash flow 
as a result of the acquisition of eastern and eni  we are now subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca 
the rules and regulations under puhca generally limit the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system  and non utility businesses that are reasonably incidental  or economically necessary or appropriate to the system s utility business 
in addition  as part of the regulatory provisions of puhca  the sec can regulate certain transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
in accordance with the regulations of puhca  we have established service companies that provide i traditional corporate and administrative services  ii gas and electric transmission and distribution systems planning  marketing  and gas supply planning and procurement  and iii engineering and surveying services to subsidiaries 
revised methodologies approved by the sec will be used to allocate service company costs to affiliates and may result in more or less costs being charged to the affiliates than in previous years 
however  it is anticipated that the consolidated results will not be impacted by the allocations 
see regulation and rate matters  securities and exchange commission regulation for additional details on puhca regulations 
finally  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

to have a material effect on our net income for the year ended december  however  sfas no 
may have a significant effect on other comprehensive income because of fluctuations in the market value of the derivatives we employ 
further  depending on the quarterly measurement of hedging effectiveness  sfas no

segment review of operations the segment review that follows reflects the operations of our newly acquired companies  eastern and eni  for the period november  through december  and excludes after tax charges of million recorded in associated with our early retirement and severance programs 
also  as previously mentioned  due to the change in the structure of our business as a result of the lipa transaction and the requirements of purchase accounting applicable to the keyspan acquisition  results of operations for the transition period are not comparable to the results of operations for and therefore  for comparative purposes  we have combined the results of operations  excluding non recurring and special charges  of kse and lilco for the entire twelve month period ended december  this combined presentation is intended to reflect our results as if the keyspan acquisition occurred on january  this combined company basis format will also be used to explain variations in operating results  for each business segment  between the twelve months ended december  and consolidated income loss available for common stock  excluding early retirement and severance charges recorded in and early retirement and special charges incurred in  by reporting segment is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars year ended year ended combined company december  december  twelve months ended december  income loss available for common stock gas distribution    electric services    gas exploration and production    energy services    energy investments    other    reflects results of operations under the lipa service agreements for the period may  through december  and electric operations of the former lilco for the period january  through may  gas distribution with the exception of a small portion of queens county  our gas distribution subsidiaries are the only providers of gas distribution services in the new york city counties of kings  richmond and queens and the long island counties of nassau and suffolk

net revenues net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas and associated revenue taxes increased by million or in compared to  due to the addition of the gas distribution operations of eastern and eni which contributed million to net revenues  continued gas sales growth and favorable gas prices compared to oil prices during most of the year 
net gas revenues decreased in compared to by million  or  due primarily to rate reductions associated with the keyspan acquisition 
kedny reduced rates to its core customers by million on an annual basis effective may  and kedli reduced its rates to core customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  for the year ended december   rate reductions affected revenues by approximately million compared to firm net gas revenues grew approximately million in  over the gas distribution operations of eastern and eni added million to net firm revenues  while our new york based gas distribution operations added million to firm net revenues through the addition of new gas customers and oil to gas conversions  primarily in the long island market  as well as from the benefits of colder weather 
long island has a low natural gas saturation rate for space heating use and significant gas sales growth opportunities are believed to be available 
we estimate that on long island less than of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating 
further  we believe significant gas sales growth opportunities exist in the new england market due to the relatively low penetration of customers using gas for space heating use 
we estimate that in our new england service territories less than of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating 
in both our long island and new england service areas  we will continue to seek growth through the expansion of our gas distribution system  as well as through the conversion of residential homes from oil to gas for space heating purposes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
firm net gas revenues grew approximately million in over due to the addition of new gas customers and oil to gas conversions  primarily on long island  as well as from the benefits of colder weather 
in the large volume heating markets and other interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are set to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
while the price of both heating grade fuel oil and natural gas increased significantly in  gas generally sold at a slight discount to heating oil during the year 
we increased sales in these markets by million in compared to last year  through aggressive unit pricing and the addition of two large commercial and industrial customers 
the majority of interruptible profits earned by eastern and eni are refunded to firm customers 
during  gas generally sold at a premium to heating oil 
nevertheless  we increased sales in this market in compared to  by approximately million  through aggressive unit pricing and the addition of new customers 
net revenues in were also favorably affected by recovery of previously deferred property taxes 
contributing to the reduction in comparative net revenues in compared to was a decrease in certain regulatory incentives  and since april net revenues no longer reflect revenues derived by kedny from certain appliance and repair services which were spun off to a subsidiary in the energy services segment 
kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that largely offsets shortfalls or excesses of firm net revenues during a heating season due to variations from normal weather 
the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
as a result  fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on results of operations for these subsidiaries 
sales  transportation and other quantities firm gas sales quantities increased by in compared to reflecting firm sales from our newly acquired new england gas distribution operations  the addition of new gas customers as discussed above  and the benefits derived from colder weather 
weather normalized sales quantities increased by approximately in compared to in our new york and long island service territories  while the addition of the new england gas distribution operations increased firm sales by 
the increase in gas sales quantities for compared to reflects an increase of in weather normalized firm sales quantities resulting from customer additions and oil to gas conversions and colder weather in firm gas transportation quantities increased in all periods  as we continue our natural gas deregulation initiatives 
at december   approximately  residential  commercial and industrial customers in our new york and long island service territories purchased their gas supply from third party suppliers compared to approximately  customers in and  customers in the new england gas distribution subsidiaries also offer unbundled services to all commercial and industrial customers 
as of december   these subsidiaries had approximately  firm transportation customers 
unbundled service to massachusetts residential customers was effective november  our net revenues are currently not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers are generally the same as the delivery component of the total rates charged to full sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to our electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from these services are not material 
other sales quantities include on system interruptible quantities  off system sales quantities sales made to customers outside of our service territories and related transportation 
effective april   we entered into an agreement with coral resources  lp coral  a subsidiary of shell oil company 
coral assists in the origination  structuring  valuation and execution of energy related transactions 
under our new york public service commission nypsc approved rate plans  net revenues realized from off system gas transactions are shared between gas customers and kedny and kedli 
a portion of the net revenues on such transactions accruing to kedny and kedli are then shared with coral 
kedny and kedli also share in net revenues arising from certain transactions initiated by coral 
prior to this agreement with coral  kedny had an agreement with enron capital and trade resources corp  a subsidiary of enron corp  which expired on march  pursuant to that agreement  enron provided gas supply and asset management services to kedny for a fee  and obtained the right to earn revenues based upon its management of kedny s gas supply requirements  storage arrangements and interstate pipeline capacity rights 
as a result of this agreement  kedny did not report any off system sales quantities in effective november   the massachusetts based gas subsidiaries entered into a three year portfolio management contract with el paso energy marketing  inc el paso provides all of the city gate supply requirements to the three massachusetts companies at market prices and manages certain of the companies upstream capacity  underground storage and term supply contracts 
the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte approved the contract in october the annual fee paid by el paso to manage the companies portfolio is  for the most part  returned to firm customers 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to last year due primarily to the addition of eastern s and eni s gas distribution operations 
eastern and eni collectively added million to operating expenses in this amount includes operations and maintenance costs of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million and general taxes of million 
included in the depreciation and amortization charge  is an expense of approximately million primarily representing two months amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of eastern and eni that was assigned to gas distribution operations 
the remaining increase in depreciation and amortization expense reflects continued property additions  and the amortization of certain costs previously deferred and now being recovered through revenue recovery mechanisms 
further  operating taxes  which include state and local taxes on property have increased as the applicable property base and tax rates generally have increased 
operating expenses decreased in compared to by million  or 
during  we realized significant reductions in operations and maintenance expense reflecting  primarily the benefits derived from cost reduction measures and operating efficiencies employed in prior years 
such measures included  but were not limited to  the early retirement program completed in in addition  kedny s spin off of non safety related appliance repair services to an energy services subsidiary in april contributed to the reduction in operations and maintenance expense for this segment 
kedli discontinued providing non safety related appliance repair services on july   further reducing operating expenses for this segment 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to reflects continued property additions and the amortization of previously deferred merger related expenses 
as provided for in the settlement agreement approved by the nypsc  by which the nypsc authorized the keyspan acquisition  kedny and kedli deferred certain merger related costs at the time of the merger 
these costs are being amortized over a ten year period 
see gas distribution rate matters for further details on the stipulation agreement 
earnings in addition to the matters discussed earlier  earnings available for common stock also reflect interest expense and income tax provisions 
interest expense for was million higher compared to last year due to million of interest expense associated with the gas distribution operations of eastern and eni and the issuance of million of medium term notes in february by kedli 
included in interest expense is million associated with the debt incurred to acquire eastern and eni 
further  we incurred an increase in our income tax provision due to a change in our basis for computing certain local income taxes 
the increase in earnings in compared to reflects primarily the net result of the items mentioned above 
in addition  earnings were favorably affected by carrying charges on certain regulatory deferrals previously mentioned as well as lower interest expense 
future developments we believe there remains significant growth opportunities in our long island and new england gas distribution service areas 
the northeast region represents a significant portion of the country s population and energy consumption 
as our gas distribution operations evolve within the new deregulated gas environment  gas sales growth will remain a critical core strategy 
customer additions are and will remain critical to our earnings enhancement in the future 
we intend to continue our gas growth initiatives on long island and in the new england region 
the beneficial effect of these initiatives  however  may not be fully realized in the short term since we will make incremental investments in our gas distribution network and expand our promotional campaigns to optimize the long term growth opportunities in our territories 
our current forecast for capital expenditures in is million and reflects anticipated expenditures for our gas expansion initiatives on long island and in new england 
to take advantage of the anticipated gas sales growth opportunities in the new york city metropolitan area  we recently announced that we have formed islander east pipeline  llc  a limited liability company in which a keyspan subsidiary and a subsidiary of duke energy corporation each own a equity interest 
it is anticipated that islander east will design  construct  own and operate a natural gas pipeline facility consisting of approximately miles of inch and inch diameter pipeline extending from algonquin gas transmission company s facilities in connecticut  across the long island sound and connect with kedli s facilities on long island 
this pipeline  which is expected to begin operating in the last quarter of  will initially transport  dth of gas capacity daily to the long island and new york city energy markets 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired electric generating plants in queens and long island  through long term contracts  and manage the electric transmission and distribution t d system  the fuel and electric purchases  and the off system electric sales for lipa 
prior to the lipa transaction  lilco provided fully integrated electric distribution services to over one million customers on long island

revenues net revenues increased by million  or  in compared to last year due primarily to a full year of operations of the ravenswood facility 
revenues from the ravenswood facility benefitted from the sale of energy  capacity and ancillary services to the nyiso at competitive market prices  and from effective hedging strategies 
prior to the start of operations of the nyiso on november   all of the energy and capacity from the ravenswood facility was sold to consolidated edison on a cost recovery and fixed fee basis 
further  there were no sales of ancillary services in due to the volatility in the market clearing price for electricity and certain ancillary services in the nyiso energy markets  the sales prices for both energy sales and the sale of certain ancillary services to the nyiso are now subject to price caps and other price mitigation measures 
certain price mitigation measures are currently being finalized  and the final resolution of these issues and their effect on our financial position and results of operations can not be determined at this point in time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  new york state independent system operator matters for a further discussion of these matters 
purchased fuel expense in and represents costs to operate the ravenswood facility 
in  consolidated edison owned and supplied the fuel necessary to operate the facility from june  until the nyiso commenced operations 
as a result  we did not incur any fuel expense prior to november  revenues from our service agreements with lipa were million higher in compared to last year 
the increase is largely due to the construction of an underground transmission line to reinforce the electric system capacity on the southfork of long island 
the project was performed under a fixed fee contract with lipa  as part of the management services agreement 
further  revenues in include million of off system sales from our long island electric generation units 
under the terms of the energy management agreement  we are entitled to one third of the profit from any off system electricity sales arranged by us on lipa s behalf 
in addition  in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned last year 
for a description of the lipa service agreements  see lipa agreements 
revenues related to the lipa service contracts increased in  compared to the transition period  due primarily to the fact that reflects a full year of operations under these contracts 
in addition  as previously mentioned  we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements 
revenues were further enhanced in by the operations of the ravenswood facility 
however  net revenues in decreased by million  or  compared to as a result of the change in the nature of our electric operations due to the lipa transaction  our electric capital investment has been significantly reduced and accordingly  our revenues and margins under the lipa contracts reflect that reduction 
purchased fuel expense decreased by million in compared to  reflecting primarily the discontinuance of fuel and purchased power expense associated with the generating facilities located on long island 
in accordance with the energy management agreement  lipa is responsible for paying directly the costs of fuel  as well as purchased power to satisfy its customers 
as a result  since may   we no longer incur any electric fuel expense for long island generation or purchased power expense 
operating expenses operating expenses in increased by million or compared to the increase in operating expenses in reflects the operations of the ravenswood facility for a full year 
operating expenses associated with the ravenswood facility increased by million in compared to included in operating expenses for the ravenswood facility are charges of million for fuel management services provided by one of our subsidiaries within the energy services segment 
there were no comparable charges in operating expenses incurred under lipa service agreements increased by million in compared to last year due primarily to costs incurred to install the new electric transmission line discussed above 
operating expenses increased slightly in compared to the increase in operations and maintenance expense was offset  in large measure  by a decrease in depreciation expense and operating taxes 
since the lipa transaction  operations and maintenance expense includes the costs associated with the management of the t d assets acquired by lipa 
all t d related costs are expensed when incurred and recovered from lipa through monthly billings in accordance with the terms of the management services agreement 
prior to the lipa transaction  all t d related construction costs were capitalized and charged to depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
depreciation expense and operating taxes decreased in due to the sale of significant property related assets to lipa as a result of the lipa transaction 
earnings in addition to the matters discussed above  earnings available for common stock also reflect interest expense  as well as city  state and federal income tax provisions 
during  the basis for computing certain local income taxes was changed and  as a result  we recorded higher taxes in compared to earnings in compared to were favorably affected by a decrease of million in interest expense reflecting the then significantly reduced level of outstanding debt resulting from the lipa transaction 
further  prior to the keyspan acquisition  approximately million of preferred stock dividends were allocated to electric operations 
partially offsetting these benefits was the elimination of carrying charges on certain electric regulatory assets resulting from electric ratemaking mechanisms that have been discontinued due to the lipa transaction 
future developments during  we filed an application with the nypsc to build a new mw cogeneration facility at the ravenswood facility site 
we recently received the preliminary permits and are moving forward with the licensing effort 
the facility  which will generate electricity and steam  is expected to commence service in further  we continue to evaluate the electric needs on long island and may  if economic circumstances and energy needs warrant  proceed with strategies to add additional electric capacity on long island 
as discussed  in greater detail under the heading regulation and rate matters securities and exchange commission regulation  our ability to invest in electric generating facilities is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the sec 
under a generation purchase rights agreement entered into as part of the lipa transaction  lipa has the right to purchase  at fair market value  all of our long island based generating assets during the twelve month period beginning on may  during the fourth quarter of  lipa began an initial due diligence review of the feasibility of purchasing these assets and has recently expressed an intent to solicit proposals from interested parties to operate the generating facilities should they purchase them 
at this point in time  we can not predict whether lipa will exercise its right to purchase the assets  nor can we estimate the effect on our financial condition or results of operations if lipa were to exercise such right 
gas exploration and production the gas exploration and production segment is engaged in gas and oil exploration and production  and the development and acquisition of domestic natural gas and oil properties 
this segment consists of our equity interest in houston exploration  as well as keyspan exploration and production llc  our wholly owned subsidiary engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration 
effective december   keyspan and houston exploration mutually agreed that we will no longer participate in houston exploration s future offshore exploration prospects 
we will  however  continue to maintain our working interest in all wells drilled under the joint venture agreement 
we also agreed to continue the development of our working interests in prospects drilled under the drilling program  and for the year  we have agreed to commit approximately million for the development of prospects successfully drilled during and on march   under a pre existing credit arrangement  approximately million in debt owed by houston exploration to us was converted into houston exploration common equity 
upon such conversion  our common equity ownership interest in houston exploration increased from to approximately

in november  houston exploration announced a major new offshore discovery 
based on initial test drilling  houston exploration estimates that this site  located offshore louisiana and texas  has potential reserves of twelve million barrels of oil 
additional undrilled fault blocks offer unrisked exploration potential of an additional twelve million barrels of oil 
houston exploration is the operator of this site and has a working interest 
through our joint venture with houston exploration we own the remaining interest 
production from this site is not expected until late fourth quarter or first quarter of we estimate that consolidated capital expenditures to develop this site will be approximately million 
we consider our gas and oil exploration and production activities to be non core assets 
we have stated in the past that we may sell all or a portion of our non core assets if we receive what we consider to be fair value for these assets 
we anticipate that if we were to sell a portion or all of our non core assets  we would use the proceeds from the sale to retire a portion of our outstanding debt 
energy services the energy services segment primarily includes companies that provide services through four lines of business to clients located within the new york city metropolitan area  rhode island  pennsylvania  massachusetts and new hampshire

there was no energy procurement and fuel management advisory services agreement between keyspan energy supply and the ravenswood facility in this segment also realized significantly greater gross profit margins in  compared to last year  for each of its other lines of business 
these gross margin enhancements resulted from recent acquisitions of companies providing energy related services and through customer additions related to energy sales 
these benefits to gross profit margins were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses associated primarily with the operations of the newly acquired companies 
the decrease in the loss in compared to was due to an increase in revenues of  offset  in part  by an increase in operating expenses of 
the increase in comparative revenues reflects the benefits derived from companies acquired during and and the growth in the number of customers purchasing energy from our gas and electric marketing subsidiary 
the comparative increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the integration of operations of companies acquired during and  and increased purchased gas costs of our gas and electric marketing subsidiary necessary to serve a larger customer base 
the formation and commencement of operations associated with our appliance repair services in april also contributed to the comparative increase in operating expenses in energy investments earnings for this segment are derived from our interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp  our ownership of keyspan canada  our ownership interest in certain oil producing properties in alberta  canada  and our interest in the premier transco pipeline and interest in phoenix natural gas  both in northern ireland 
premier is a natural gas transmission pipeline connecting scotland and northern ireland in the united kingdom  and phoenix is a natural gas distribution company serving belfast in northern ireland 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our interest in certain oil producing properties in alberta  canada and recognized an after tax gain of approximately million from the sale 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we became the sole owner of gulf midstream by acquiring the remaining interest in this company 
for financial reporting purposes  the operations of gulf midstream d b a keyspan canada have now been fully consolidated 
earnings from this segment increased by million  or  in compared to last year reflecting earnings growth from our canadian investments 
results of operations from canadian gas and oil operations were enhanced through the acquisition  in the fourth quarter of  of the paddle river gas plant and certain oil producing properties in alberta  canada  more efficient operations of keyspan canada and the additional ownership interest in that company 
in addition  iroquois realized higher transportation sales quantities and revenues from its interruptible customers during this period compared with the same period last year 
earnings from our investments in northern ireland in are essentially the same as earnings for last year 
for much of the year  the subsidiaries in this segment were primarily accounted for under the equity method since our ownership interests were or less 
accordingly  income from these investments is reflected  primarily in other income and deductions in the consolidated statement of income 
earnings from this segment increased by million in reflecting primarily earnings from our investment in gulf midstream  formed in december  and more favorable results from investments in northern ireland 
in addition  in results of operations from this segment reflect after tax costs of million to settle certain contracts associated with the sale  in  of certain cogeneration investments and related fuel management operations 
future developments we consider this segment to be a non core investment 
as mentioned previously  we may sell all or a portion of our non core assets within the next few years 
at this point in time  we can not predict when we may sell any of our non core assets  or the effect such sale may have on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
other the other segment reflects preferred stock dividends  general expenses incurred by our corporate and administrative areas that have not been allocated to our various business segments  and interest income earned on temporary cash investments 
further  this segment includes results of operations related to our in land marine transportation subsidiary  midland enterprises  that was acquired as part of the eastern acquisition 
the significant increase in the loss incurred by the other segment in compared to reflects the following i an after tax charge of million for an additional contribution to the keyspan foundation  ii an after tax charge of related to certain rate settlement issues  iii a loss of million  after tax  associated with our investment in certain technology related activities  iv branding expenses and other costs related to the integration of the eastern and eni companies into our operations of million  and v an increase in interest expense of million associated with higher levels of commercial paper outstanding 
further  we realized million less in interest income  after tax  on temporary cash investments as we utilized cash to finance certain acquisitions  repurchase shares of our common stock  and retire maturing debt during the past two years 
pursuant to an order of the sec issued under puhca by which the sec approved the eastern and eni acquisitions  we are required to divest our interest in midland enterprises by no later than november  because its operations are not functionally related to our core utility operations 
the other segment incurred a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in in we recognized million less in interest income  after tax  on temporary cash investments due to the utilization of cash to finance certain acquisitions  repurchase shares of our common stock  and retire maturing debt 
in the other segment recorded an after tax charge of million to write off a customer billing system that was in development 
further  we made a million donation  million after tax  to the keyspan foundation 
liquidity cash flow from operations for reflects stable growth from our gas distribution operations  as well as positive contributions from our electric operations 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in compared to last year however  reflects working capital requirements primarily as a result of the rising price of natural gas in the later part of as a result of the seasonal nature of our gas distribution operations  we incur significant cash expenditures during the summer and early fall to fill our storage facilities with natural gas that is used by our customers during the winter heating season 
we recover these costs in subsequent periods as the gas is removed from storage and sold to our customers primarily for space heating purposes 
significant cash flows are generated during the first and second quarters of the subsequent fiscal year as we receive payments from customers for such use 
cash flow from operations also reflects a decrease in interest income  and an increase in interest payments due to increased levels of outstanding debt 
further  in cash flow from operations reflects the cash utilization of a million net operating loss carryforward on income tax payments for  as previously discussed 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared to the transition period reflects the significant positive cash flows realized from revenues generated during the heating season  continued strong results from core utility operations  cash generated from the ravenswood facility  and the benefits derived from the integration of kse acquired companies for an entire twelve month period 
results from gas heating season operations are not reflected in the transition period  as previously explained 
further  as indicated above  cash flow from operations in reflects the utilization of a million net operating loss carryforward on income tax payments for moreover  during the transition period  million was funded into voluntary employee beneficiary trusts to fund certain employee postretirement welfare benefits and  as a result  cash flow from operations for the transition period was adversely affected 
at december   we had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
in addition  we have two revolving credit agreements  with a commercial bank syndicate totaling billion 
these agreements expire in september  and our current intention is to renew these agreements 
these credit facilities are used to support our billion commercial paper program 
at december   billion of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
we had available borrowing of million at december  commercial paper was issued during to i finance approximately million of the approximately billion purchase price associated with the acquisitions of eastern and eni  ii redeem our preferred stock series aa for million  and iii support ongoing working capital needs 
houston exploration has an unsecured available line of credit with a commercial bank that provides for a maximum commitment of million  subject to certain conditions 
during  houston exploration borrowed million under its credit facility and repaid million  at december   million remained outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
at december   houston exploration had available borrowing of million 
also  a subsidiary included in the energy investments segment has two revolving loan agreements with financial institutions in canada 
borrowings under these agreements during were million  including the financing for the purchase of the remaining interest in gulf midstream 
at december   million was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
the energy investments segment currently has available borrowing of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt for further information on these agreements 
we satisfy our seasonal working capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 
in addition  we utilize treasury stock to satisfy the requirements of our common stock plans 
we believe that these sources of funds are sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
capital expenditures and financing construction expenditures the table below sets forth our construction expenditures by segment for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars actual estimated year ended year ended december  december  gas distribution   electric services   gas exploration and production   energy services   energy investments and other   construction expenditures related to the gas distribution segment are primarily for the renewal and replacement of mains and services and for the expansion of the gas distribution system on long island and in new england 
construction expenditures for include costs associated with the gas distribution operations of eastern and eni for two months 
construction expenditures for the electric services segment reflect primarily costs to maintain our electric generating facilities 
construction expenditures related to the gas exploration and production segment reflect  in part  costs related to the development of properties acquired in southern louisiana and in the gulf of mexico in and costs related to the continued development of other properties previously acquired 
expenditures also include development costs associated with our joint venture with houston exploration 
energy investments and other construction expenditures reflect  primarily costs related to canadian affiliates 
the amount of future construction expenditures is reviewed on an ongoing basis and can be affected by timing  scope and changes in investment opportunities 
equity investments during  we made a number of significant equity investments 
as previously mentioned  we acquired eastern and eni in november  and we acquired the remaining in gulf midstream during the last quarter of in addition  during  the energy services segment acquired four additional companies located in the new york city metropolitan area 
the newly acquired companies specialize in engineering consulting  plumbing and mechanical contracting  and heating  ventilation and air conditioning contracting 
combined  these companies have over  employees and revenues of approximately million 
financing in connection with our acquisition of eastern and eni  we issued billion of long term debt 
the debt was issued in three different maturities ranging from five to thirty years in the following denominations i million notes due  ii million notes due  and iii million notes due the interest on the notes is payable on a semi annual basis on may and november of each year  beginning may  the total purchase price for the eastern and eni acquisitions was billion and  as previously indicated  we issued approximately million of commercial paper for additional financing 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  eastern energynorth acquisitions for further details on the transactions 
in anticipation of the issuance of long term debt securities to finance the eastern and eni acquisitions  we entered into forward starting swap agreements during to hedge a portion of the risk that the cost of the future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
under the forward starting swaps  we agreed to pay or receive an amount equal to the difference between the net present value of the cash flows for a notional amount of indebtedness based on the existing yield of a hedging instrument at the date of the agreement and at the date the agreement is settled 
these derivative instruments were settled at the closing of the eastern and eni transactions 
kedli had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec for the issuance of up to million of medium term notes 
on february   kedli issued million notes due february  the net proceeds from this issuance were used to reimburse our treasury for costs in paying million of promissory notes to lipa that matured in june in january  kedli issued an additional million of medium term notes at due january  the medium term notes issued are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
we intend to use the proceeds from this financing to fund our gas expansion initiatives on long island 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt for more information regarding outstanding debt 
in june  we redeemed  at maturity  preferred stock series aa through the utilization of internally generated funds and the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper 
our obligation of million included the mandatory redemption price of per share totaling million and a dividend payable totaling million 
we anticipate issuing preferred stock during to replace this series that matured 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to percent of our then outstanding stock  or approximately million common shares 
a second authorization permitted us to use up to an additional million of cash for the purchase of common shares 
in  we completed this program and now utilize treasury stock to satisfy the requirements of our common stock plans 
at december   we had million shares  or million  of treasury stock remaining 
during  we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and debt and equity levels 
further  we will manage our balance sheet to maintain strong ratings at each of our rated entities 
we believe that our sources of funding  ie anticipated preferred stock issuances  reissuing common stock from treasury stock and the availability of commercial paper borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs 
further  as mentioned previously  we may sell all or a portion of our non core assets 
at december  our ratio of debt  including commercial paper  to total capitalization was approximately 
however  if we divest of certain non core assets  we believe that we can achieve a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately within the next several years 
as a registered holding company  we are subject to certain financing restrictions

dividends we are currently paying a dividend at an annual rate of per common share 
our dividend policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors 
the amount and timing of all dividend payments is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon business conditions  results of operations  financial conditions and other factors 
pursuant to the nypsc s orders dated february  and april  approving the keyspan acquisition  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to the parent company is conditioned upon maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under the customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  the ratio of debt to total utility capitalization was and  respectively 
our corporate and financial activities and those of each of our subsidiaries including their ability to pay dividends to us are also subject to regulation by the sec 
for additional information  see the discussion under the heading securities and exchange commission regulation 
regulation and rate matters gas distribution by orders dated february  and april  the nypsc approved a settlement agreement among brooklyn union  lilco  the staff of the department of public service and six other parties that in effect approved the keyspan acquisition and established gas rates for both kedny and kedli 
under the agreement  billion of efficiency savings  excluding gas costs  attributable to operating synergies that are expected to be realized over the year period following the combination  were allocated to customers net of transaction costs 
under the settlement agreement  effective may   kedny s base rates to core customers were reduced by million annually 
in addition  kedny is now subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it will be required to credit core customers with of any utility earnings up to basis points above certain threshold return on equity levels over the term of the rate plan other than any earnings associated with discrete incentives and of any utility earnings in excess of basis points above such threshold levels 
the threshold levels are for the rate years ended september  and  and for the rate year kedny exceeded the threshold return on equity by basis points for the rate year ended september  the settlement agreement also required kedli to reduce base rates to its customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  kedli is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit to firm customers of any utility earnings in any rate year up to basis points above a return on equity of and of any utility earnings in excess of a return on equity of 
kedli did not earn above its threshold return level in its rate year ended november  on november   kedli s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  current gas distribution rates will remain in effect for unless either kedli or the nypsc initiate a rate proceeding 
we do not intend to initiate such a proceeding and at this time we have no reason to believe that the nypsc will initiate a proceeding 
therefore  we expect current gas distribution rates for our new york and long island based gas distribution utilities to remain in effect through boston gas company s gas rates for local distribution service are governed by a five year performance based rate plan approved by the dte in the plan 
under the plan  boston gas company s rates for local distribution are recalculated annually to reflect inflation for the previous months  and reduced by a productivity factor of 
the productivity factor has been the subject of a remand proceeding at the dte as discussed below 
the plan also calls for penalties if boston gas company fails to meet specified service quality measures  with a maximum potential expense of million  which has also been a subject in the dte s remand proceeding 
there is a margin sharing mechanism  whereby of earnings in excess of a return on equity are passed back to customers 
similarly  ratepayers absorb of any shortfall below a return on equity 
with respect to the appeal by boston gas company of the plan  the massachusetts supreme judicial court issued an order vacating i the accumulated inefficiencies component of the productivity factor  thereby reducing the productivity factor from to  and ii the expansion of the service quality penalty beyond million  and remanded these matters to the dte for further proceedings  which actions were requested by the dte in its motion for discharge of report and remand 
on january   the dte issued an order in the remand proceeding 
the order imposes a accumulated inefficiencies factor  thereby increasing the productivity factor from to and sets the maximum service quality adjustment at million 
the order requires the accumulated inefficiencies factor be implemented retroactively as of november  on january   boston gas company filed a petition for appeal and motion for a stay with the massachusetts supreme judicial court  and on february   the court granted the stay pending the appeal 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding 
securities and exchange commission regulation keyspan and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
the rules and regulations under puhca generally limit the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related businesses 
in addition  the principal regulatory provisions of puhca i regulate certain transactions among affiliates within a holding company system including the payment of dividends by such subsidiaries to a holding company  ii govern the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by a holding company and its subsidiaries  iii limit the entry by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries into businesses other than electric and or gas utility businesses  and iv require sec approval for certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
the sec s order issued on may   in connection with our acquisition of eastern and eni  provides us with  among other things  authorization to do the following through december  the authorization period a subject to an aggregate amount of billion  i maintain existing financing agreements  ii issue and sell up to billion of additional securities in compliance with certain defined parameters  iii issue additional guarantees and other forms of credit support in an aggregate amount of billion at any time in addition to any such securities  guarantees and credit support outstanding or existing as of november   and iv amend  review  extend  supplement or replace any of the foregoing  b issue shares of common stock or reissue shares of common stock held in treasury under dividend reinvestment and stock based management incentive and employee benefit plans  c maintain existing and enter into additional hedging transactions with respect to outstanding indebtedness in order to manage and minimize interest rate costs  d invest up to of our consolidated retained earnings in exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies  and e pay dividends out of capital and unearned surplus as well as paid in capital with respect to certain subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we have committed that during the authorization period  our common equity will be at least of our consolidated capitalization and each of our utility subsidiaries common equity will be at least of such entity s capitalization 
electric services revenue mechanisms lipa agreements keyspan  through certain of its subsidiaries  provides services to lipa under the following agreements management services agreement msa a keyspan subsidiary manages the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of the t d system 
lipa will exercise control over the performance of the t d system through specific standards for performance and incentives 
in exchange for providing the services  we will earn a million annual management fee and will be operating under an eight year contract which provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon our performance 
annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  we can earn certain incentives for cost reductions associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for us to i retain of cost reductions on the first million in reductions  and ii retain of additional cost reductions up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings will accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  we will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  we have performed our obligations under the msa within the agreed upon budget guidelines and we are committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa a keyspan subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy are made under rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the rates may be modified in the future in accordance with the terms of the psa for i agreed upon labor and expense indices applied to the base year  ii a return of and on net capital additions required for the generating facilities  and iii reasonably incurred expenses that are outside our control 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the amount of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy from us and is able to purchase energy on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
we must  therefore  operate our generating facilities in a manner such that we can remain competitive with other producers of energy 
to date  we have dispatched to lipa and lipa has accepted the level of energy generated at the agreed to price per megawatt hour 
however  no assurances can be given as to the level and price of energy to be dispatched to lipa in the future 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability of the generating facilities 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years 
as discussed previously  beginning on may   lipa will have the right for a one year period to acquire all of our long island based generating assets at the fair market value at the time of the exercise of the right  which value would be determined by independent appraisers 
energy management agreement ema the ema provides for a keyspan subsidiary to procure and manage fuel supplies for lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services we earn an annual fee of million 
in addition  we arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
the ema covers a period of fifteen years for the procurement of fuel supplies and eight years for off system management services 
ravenswood facility at the time of our purchase of the ravenswood facility  keyspan and consolidated edison entered into transition energy and capacity contracts 
the energy contract provided consolidated edison with of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility and covered a period of time from the date of closing  june   through november  with the start up of the nyiso  the electricity market in new york city began a transition to a competitive market for capacity  energy and ancillary services 
starting on november   we began selling the energy produced by the ravenswood facility through bidding into the nyiso energy markets on a day ahead or real time basis 
we also have the option to enter into bilateral transactions to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility to load serving entities lse  ie entities that sell to end users or to brokers and marketers 
at this point in time  we have sold energy exclusively through the nyiso 
the capacity contract  which provided consolidated edison with of the available capacity of the ravenswood facility expired on april  since that date  the available capacity of the ravenswood facility has been bid into on the auction process conducted by the nyiso 
we also have the option to sell the capacity through bilateral contracts 
it is anticipated that in  approximately of earnings from the ravenswood facility will be derived from capacity sales through either the auction process associated with the nyiso or contracts with lses 
environmental matters keyspan is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulatory programs related to the environment 
ongoing environmental compliance activities  which have not been material  are charged to operation and maintenance activities 
we estimate that the remaining cost of our manufactured gas plant mgp related environmental cleanup activities  including costs associated with the ravenswood facility and costs associated with eastern and eni mgp sites  will be approximately million and we have recorded a related liability for such amount 
eastern has recorded an additional million liability representing the estimated environmental cleanup costs related to a former coal tar processing facility 
further  as of december   we have expended a total of million  including expenditures made by eastern and eni since acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations and contingencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various risk exposures and uncertainties associated with our operations 
the most significant contingency involves the evolution of the gas distribution industry toward a more competitive and deregulated environment 
most important to keyspan  is the evolution of regulatory policy as it pertains to our historical gas merchant role 
in addition  we are exposed to commodity price risk  interest rate risk and  to a much less degree  foreign currency translation risk 
set forth below is a description of these exposures and an explanation as to how we have managed and  to the extent possible  sought to reduce these risks 
regulatory issues and the competitive environment the gas industry the energy industry continues to undergo fundamental changes  which may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of utilities  as regulatory authorities  elected officials and customers seek lower energy prices and broader choices 
new york over the past several years  the nypsc has been formulating a policy framework to guide the transition of new york state s gas distribution industry in the deregulated gas industry environment 
since  customers in the small volume market have been given the option to purchase their gas supplies from sources other than our two new york gas utility subsidiaries 
large volume customers had this option for a number of years prior to in addition to transporting gas that customers purchase from marketers  our utilities have been providing billing  meter reading and other services for aggregate rates that match the distribution charge reflected in otherwise applicable sales rates to supply these customers 
in november  the nypsc issued a policy statement setting forth its vision for furthering competition in the natural gas industry 
under this vision  regulated natural gas utilities or local distribution companies ldcs would plan to exit the business of purchasing gas for and selling gas to customers the merchant function over the next three to seven years 
ldcs would remain the operators of the gas system the distribution function and the provider of last resort of natural gas supplies during that period and until alternatives are developed 
the nypsc s goal is to encourage more competition at the local level by separating the merchant function from the distribution function 
as required by the nypsc s policy statement  our two new york gas distribution subsidiaries filed a joint restructuring proposal with the nypsc in october settlement discussions with the staff of the nypsc and other interested parties were held regarding the joint restructuring proposal 
those discussions resulted in an interim gas restructuring agreement which the nypsc approved in its order establishing interim rate plan interim agreement  issued on december  the interim agreement as approved provided that  among other things i present base rates will remain unchanged  ii heating customers will receive a one time bill credit of to offset gas commodity prices during the winter of  and iii marketers will receive an incentive payment equal to of the delivery charges marketers incur to serve firm customers to encourage marketers to provide gas commodity sales to our customers 
both the credit and the incentive payment will be deferred  and the formula for recovery of potential stranded capacity costs will be modified to maintain a more stable allocation of fixed costs between sales and transportation services 
the term of the interim agreement expires on june   and also provides that the parties will resume negotiations on issues that were not resolved  including  daily balancing  a migration program for cooking only customers  a low income customer aggregation program  and a back out credit to be applied to rates charged to customers who migrate to a non utility energy supplier 
we  the staff of the nypsc and other interested parties have begun discussions to address the issues remaining in the case 
new england in july  the dte directed massachusetts gas distribution companies to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement agreement by the ldc s and the marketer group regarding model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service was approved by the dte in november in february  the dte issued its order on how unbundling of natural gas service will proceed 
for a five year transition period  the dte determined that ldc contractual commitments to upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas supply to the ldc s customers 
the approved mandatory assignment method eliminates the possibility that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by the ldcs to serve firm customers will be absorbed by the ldc or other customers through the transition period 
the dte also found that  through the transition period  ldcs will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to assure that adequate capacity is available to support customer requirements and growth 
last fall  the dte approved the ldcs terms and conditions of distribution service that conform to the settled upon model terms and conditions 
effective november   all massachusetts gas customers have the option to purchase their gas supplies from third party sources other than the ldcs 
we believe that the actions described above strike a balance among competing stakeholder interests in order to most effectively make available the benefits of the unbundled gas supply market to all customers 
the electric industry in new york and long island as previously mentioned  our electric operations on long island are generally governed by service agreements with lipa 
the agreements have terms of eight to fifteen years and generally provide for recovery of virtually all costs of production  operation and maintenance 
at this time  we face minimal competitive pressures associated with our electric operations on long island 
with our investment in the ravenswood facility  we also have electric operations in new york city 
we currently sell the energy produced by the ravenswood facility  as well as its capacity  through daily and or hourly bidding into the nyiso energy markets 
new york city local reliability rules currently require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city is to be provided by in city generators 
at this time  there is a shortage of in city capacity and therefore  we anticipate that we can sell the capacity of the ravenswood facility at a level approaching the ferc mandated price cap 
we expect that the current local reliability rules will remain in effect at least through october  however  should new  more efficient electric power plants be built in new york city and or the requirement that of in city load be served by in city generators be modified  capacity and energy sales volumes could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants will be built or the nature of future new york city requirements 
california deregulation in the late s  the california public utilities commission cpuc ordered the state s electric utilities to divest their generation assets  and purchase their electricity supply from the california power exchange px on a spot or short term basis 
in addition  the electric utilities were subjected to caps on the prices they charged their customers at retail 
no provisions were made in the cpuc s orders or the restructuring agreements entered into by the utilities and other parties to reopen the retail rate issue in the event the utilities financial integrity became jeopardized 
within the last year  wholesale electricity supply levels have become insufficient to meet demand  spot market prices have increased  and retail rates are now insufficient to compensate the utilities for their wholesale supply costs  causing severe financial disruptions for those utilities 
in contrast  our gas distribution subsidiaries maintain flexibility in their gas procurement policies and practices and are not required to purchase gas commodity or capacity in any specific manner as long as the purchases are made on a least cost basis 
our gas distribution subsidiaries also operate under rate regulated cost recovery mechanisms associated with their retail rates that provide for recovery of costs on a current and deferred basis 
in the event that our gas distribution subsidiaries financial integrity were jeopardized  there is a provision in their currently effective rate plans that would allow for the reexamination of their retail rate structure 
with regards to our electric service operations  as previously indicated  under our lipa service agreements  virtually all costs of production  operation and maintenance are being recovered 
in addition  due to new york city local reliability rules  we anticipate that we can sell a significant portion of the capacity associated with the ravenswood facility 
moreover  we are currently recovering of our electric fuel costs and expect to continue to recover these costs through sales into the nyiso 
derivative financial instruments as previously mentioned  and more fully detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values  we employ derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk and interest rate risk and to fix the selling price on a portion of our peak electric energy capacity 
all of our derivative financial instruments  except for certain interest rate swaps  are and will continue to be classified as cash flow hedges and expire in as a result  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is not expected to have a material effect on our net income in  but could have a significant effect on comprehensive income because of fluctuations in the market value of the derivatives employed for hedging certain risks 
under sfas no 
 periodic changes in market value are recorded as comprehensive income  subject to effectiveness  and then included in net income to match the underlying transactions 
futures  options and swaps we employ  from time to time  derivative financial instruments  such as futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging exposure to commodity price risk and to fix the selling price on a portion of our peak electric energy capacity 
whenever hedge positions are in effect  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to derivative contracts  as well as nonperformance by the counter parties of the transactions against which they are hedged 
we believe that the credit risk related to the futures  options and swap instruments is no greater than that associated with the primary commodity contracts which they hedge  as the instrument contracts are with major investment grade financial institutions  and that reduction of the exposure to price risk lowers our overall business risk 
interest rate hedges we continually monitor the cost relationship between fixed and variable rate debt 
in line with our objective to minimize capital costs  we periodically enter into hedging transactions through interest rate swaps that effectively convert the terms of the underlying debt obligations from fixed to variable and or variable to fixed 
swap agreements are only entered into with creditworthy counter parties
