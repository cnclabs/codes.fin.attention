item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company designs  develops  manufactures and markets a sample preparation system for medical diagnostic applications 
the thinprep system consists of the thin prep processor  and related disposable reagents  filters and other supplies 
the company has marketed the thinprep system for use in non gynecological testing applications since on may   the company received pma approval from the fda to market the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening as a replacement for the conventional pap smear method 
on november   the fda cleared expanded product labeling for the thinprep system to include the claim that the thinprep system is significantly more effective in detecting low grade and more severe lesions than the conventional pap smear method in a variety of patient populations 
the expanded labeling also indicates that the specimen quality using the thinprep system is significantly improved over that of the conventional pap smear method 
on february   the fda approved the company s supplemental pma application for use of a combination of an endocervical brush and spatula sampling devices  which is a commonly used method of collecting samples for conventional pap smears 
on september   the fda approved the company s supplemental pma application for the testing for hpv directly from a single vial of patient specimen collected in a thinprep solution using the hybrid capture hpv dna assay of digene corporation 
in march  the fda approved the use of digene corporation s hybrid capture ii hpv dna assay from a single vial of patient specimen collected in thinprep solution 
the company commenced the full scale commercial launch of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states in and in selected international markets in in may  the fda approved the thinprep r processor  the company s next generation processor for automated sample preparation 
in december  the company began clinical trials of the thinprep imaging system tm to aid in cervical cancer screening 
prior to  the company incurred substantial losses  principally from expenses associated with obtaining fda approval of the company s thinprep system for cervical cancer screening  engineering and development efforts related to the thinprep processor  thinprep processor  and thinprep imaging system  expansion of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the establishment of a marketing and sales organization 
the company may experience losses in the future as it expands its domestic and international marketing and sales activities and continues its product development efforts 
the operating results of the company have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and a quarterly basis 
the company expects that its operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future depending on a number of factors  including the extent to which the company s products continue to gain market acceptance  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its domestic and establishes its international sales and distribution networks  the timing and level of reimbursement for the thinprep system by third party payors  and other factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
the company occupies a  square foot facility in boxborough  massachusetts 
the company has installed automated customized equipment for the high volume manufacture of disposable filters for use in connection with the thinprep system 
in january  the company acquired approximately acres of land and facilities of acu pak  inc  a contract packager in londonderry  new hampshire that was manufacturing  filling vials containing and distributing the company s solutions for all of its thinprep line of products  for approximately million in cash 
the company accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and is amortizing goodwill associated with the purchase over seven years which began in january the cost per thinprep r pap test tm  plus a laboratory mark up  is generally billed by laboratories to third party payors and results in a higher amount for the thinprep pap test than the current billing for conventional pap tests 
successful sales of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states and other countries will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans  managed care organizations and medicare and medicaid 
in the united states  the current rate of reimbursement to laboratories from managed care organizations and other third party payors to screen conventional pap smears ranges from approximately to per test  with as the most common rate of reimbursement 
although many health insurance companies have added the thinprep pap test to their coverage  there can be no assurance that third party payors will provide or continue to provide such coverage  that reimbursement levels will be adequate or that health care providers or clinical laboratories will use the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in lieu of the conventional pap smear method 
since january   the company s laboratory customers have been able to request reimbursement for the thinprep pap test from health insurance companies and the ushcfa united states health care financing administration using a newly assigned common procedure technology cpt code specifically for liquid based monolayer cervical cell specimen preparation 
cpt codes are assigned  maintained and revised by the cpt editorial board  which is administered by the american medical association  and are used in the submission of claims to third party payors for reimbursement for medical services 
initial delays in the implementation of the new cpt code by third party payors  however  resulted in delayed reimbursement to the company s laboratory customers in the first half of as a result  the company believes that orders for thinprep pap tests during the first half of were reduced  delayed or eliminated 
the company s direct sales force is actively working with current laboratory customers and health insurance companies to facilitate reimbursement under the new cpt code 
as of december   based on information provided to the company  the company believes that all of the health insurance companies which announced coverage of the thinprep pap test have implemented the new cpt code and have established a reimbursement amount 
there are approximately six hundred managed care organizations and other third party payors in the united states 
there can be no assurance  however  that reimbursement levels under the new cpt code will be adequate 
the company expects to continue its significant expenditures for sales and marketing activities of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in during  the company entered into a co promotion agreement with mead johnson to promote the thinprep pap test to obstetricians and gynecologists in the united states 
the mead johnson agreement expired on december   however  mead johnson received a residual payment of approximately million in february based on product sales 
the clinical laboratory companies have worked with the company on marketing and sales programs  which generally involve joint marketing geared toward promoting the company s products to physicians and third party payors 
in january  the company entered into a supply and co marketing agreement with quest diagnostics incorporated to market the thinprep pap test as quest diagnostics exclusive liquid based cervical cancer screening methodology 
in october  the company entered into an agreement with roche diagnostics corporation rdc  exclusive in the united states and puerto rico  to co promote the benefits of testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea using rdc s cobas r amplicor r ct ng test directly from the thinprep collection vial 
the companies also intend to explore the potential for collaborating on a portfolio of additional screening and diagnostic tests based on the companies respective technologies 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with digene corporation digene  exclusive in the united states and puerto rico  to co promote the benefits of testing for human papillomavirus hpv using digene s hybrid capture r ii hpv dna assay directly from the thinprep collection vial 
the companies expect that the co promotion program will initially focus on promoting digene s hpv dna test  using the residual material in thinprep collection vials  as the optimal patient management strategy for borderline cytology results 
the company expects to increase its expenditures in for research and development to fund development of the thinprep imaging system  as well as follow on products and additional applications of thinprep technology

the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources required to further develop its marketing and sales capabilities  both domestic and international  the extent to which such activities generate market acceptance and demand for the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening and additional applications of its thinprep technology 
the company s liquidity and capital requirements will also depend upon the progress of the company s research and development programs to develop follow on products including the thinprep imaging system  the receipt of and the time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  and the resources the company devotes to developing  manufacturing and marketing its products 
in addition  the company s capital requirements will depend on the extent of potential liabilities  if any  and costs associated with any future litigation see legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing or will not in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the company has net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  at december  that will expire at various dates through the year if not utilized 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are subject to review by the internal revenue service 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  may limit the amount of these tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities 
the amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value immediately prior to the ownership change 
subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
the company does not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 or derivative commodity instruments 
all of the company s investments are in short term  investment grade commercial paper  corporate bonds and us government and agency securities that are carried at fair value on the company s books 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but the company believes this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
the company s business outside the united states is conducted in local currency transactions 
the company has no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign hedging arrangements 
however  the company estimates that any market risk associated with its foreign operations is not significant and is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain factors which may affect future results the forward looking statements in this form k are made under the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s operating results and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
statements in this form k which are not strictly historical statements  including  without limitation  statements regarding management s expectations for future growth and plans and objectives for future management and operations  domestic and international marketing and sales plans  product plans and performance  potential savings to the healthcare system  management s assessment of market factors  as well as statements regarding the strategy and plans of the company  constitute forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial conditions  and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
dependence on single product 
substantially all of the company s revenues to date have been derived from sales of its thinprep processor and predecessor instruments  and related reagents  filters and other supplies for use in gynecological and non gynecological testing applications 
although the company has begun marketing its next generation thinprep processor and is currently in clinical trials for its thinprep imaging system  neither product has generated significant revenue to date 
the company s inability to successfully commercialize its current thinprep system for cervical cancer screening or to obtain adequate third party reimbursement coverage  among other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty of fda approval 
the manufacturer and sale of medical diagnostic devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the united states and fda approval is required before any united states commercial sales of such devices may commence 
in december  the company initiated clinical trials for its thinprep imaging system 
there can be no assurance that this product will receive necessary regulatory approval on a timely basis  or at all 
uncertainty of market acceptance and additional cost 
the company s success and growth will depend on market acceptance of the thinprep system  including follow on products and additional applications of thinprep technology  if any  for cervical cancer screening by healthcare providers  third party payors and clinical laboratories 
the laboratory cost of using the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening is higher than that of a conventional pap smear 
due in part to increased competitive pressures in the healthcare industry to reduce costs  the company s ability to gain market acceptance of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening will depend on the company s ability to demonstrate that the higher cost of using the thinprep system will be offset by a reduction in costs often associated with conventional pap smears  including inaccurate diagnoses and the need for repeat pap tests 
limited marketing and sales experience 
although the company received clearance from the fda to market its thinprep system for cervical cancer screening on may   the company initiated full scale marketing and sales efforts for the thinprep system in united states beginning only in the first quarter of in order to effectively market the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening  the company will need to continue to increase its marketing and sales capabilities 
no assurance can be given that the company s direct sales force or strategic marketing relationships will succeed in promoting the thinprep system to healthcare providers  third party payors or clinical laboratories  or that additional marketing and sales channels will be successfully established 
while the company is currently evaluating marketing and sales channels abroad  including contract sales organizations  distributors and marketing partners  the company has established very limited foreign sales channels 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit and retain skilled marketing  sales  service or support personnel or foreign distributors  or that the company s marketing and sales efforts will be successful 
failure to successfully expand its marketing and sales capabilities in the united states or establish its international marketing and sales organization would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party reimbursement 
successful sales of the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states and other countries will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans  managed care organizations  and medicare and medicaid 
although a number of managed care organizations have added the thinprep pap test to their coverage  there can be no assurance that reimbursement will be available  reimbursement levels will be adequate or that healthcare providers or clinical laboratories will use the thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in lieu of the conventional pap smear method 
limited number of customers and lengthy sales process 
due in part to a recent trend toward consolidation of clinical laboratories  the company expects that the number of potential domestic customers for its products will decrease 
due to the relative size of the largest united states laboratories  it is likely that a significant portion of thinprep system sales will be concentrated among a relatively small number of large clinical laboratories 
further  in order to generate demand for the thinprep pap test among clinical laboratories  the company will be required to educate physicians and healthcare providers regarding the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of the thinprep system as well as to demonstrate to such parties that adequate levels of reimbursement will be available for the thinprep pap test  a process which the company believes will require a lengthy sales effort 
limited operating history 
the company has a limited operating history and  to date  has focused on product development  clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  the expansion of manufacturing facilities and the establishment of marketing and sales capabilities for its thinprep system for cervical cancer screening in the united states and abroad 
the company s future revenues and profitability are critically dependent on the company s ability to successfully market and sell the thinprep system  including follow on products and additional applications of thinprep technology  if any  for cervical cancer screening 
management of growth 
the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations and facilities  the number of its employees and the geographic area of its operations 
such growth may place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to manage its growth effectively  the company will be required to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls  and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely effected 
intense competition 
the company faces direct competition from a number of publicly traded and privately held companies  including at least one other manufacturer of a thin layer slide preparation system 
the development  fda approval and commercial marketing of such systems for cervical cancer screening could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources than the company  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials  regulatory matters  manufacturing and marketing 
potential fluctuations in future quarterly results 
the company expects that its operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future and will depend on a number of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include the extent to which the company s products gain market acceptance  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as the company expands its domestic and establishes its international sales and distribution networks  the timing of any approvals of the thinprep system for reimbursement by third party payors  the timing and size of sales  the likelihood and timing of fda approval of pma supplements related to the thinprep system  the timing and size of expenditures incurred in the research and development of new products  and the introduction and market acceptance of competing products or technologies 
extensive government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical diagnostic devices are subject to extensive government regulation in the united states and in other countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain  frequently requiring several years from the commencement of clinical trials to the receipt of regulatory approval 
after approval  the company and its medical products remain subject to pervasive regulation and fda inspection for compliance with regulatory requirements 
the company is currently in clinical trials for its thinprep imaging system 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully obtain the necessary approvals to market and commercialize this system 
international sales and operations risks 
the company has commenced sale of its thinprep system and intends to sell any future products to customers both in the united states and internationally 
while the company is evaluating marketing and sales channels abroad  including contract sales organizations  distributors and marketing partners  the company currently has very limited foreign sales channels in place at this time 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop international sales capabilities or that  if the company establishes such capabilities  the company will be successful in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
uncertainty of additional applications 
in late and early  the company entered into agreements for the co promotion of roche diagnostics corporation s cobas r amplicor r ct ng test for the detection of chlamydia and gonorrhea and digene corporation s hybrid capture r ii hpv dna assay for the detection of the human papillomavirus hpv  in each case  directly from the thinprep collection vial 
the company intends to continue to evaluate additional diagnostic applications of its thinprep technology in testing for the presence of other types of cancers and sexually transmitted diseases 
the company has not yet determined which of these additional applications  if any  it will seek to develop  commercialize and or promote 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent on the principal members of its management and scientific staff  the loss of whose services might impede achievement of its research and development or strategic objectives 
the company s success will depend on its ability to retain key employees and to attract additional qualified employees 
dependence on patents  copyrights  licenses and proprietary rights  risk of third party claims of infringement 
the company relies on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary technology  rights and know how 
in addition  the company is the exclusive licensee of certain patented technology for use in the field of cytology related to the fluid pumping system used in the thinprep system 
failure by the company to protect  defend and maintain such intellectual property rights  or a third party claim of infringement  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see legal proceedings 
dependence on single source suppliers 
certain key components of the thinprep system  including its proprietary filter material  are currently provided to the company by single sources 
the company has been increasing its inventory of these components in an effort to mitigate this risk 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of such components on commercially reasonable terms  or in a timely manner  the company would not be able to manufacture its products on a timely and cost competitive basis  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of euro conversion 
on january   of the member countries of the european economic and monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro  and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
the euro is currently being traded on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
for a three year transition period  both the euro and each participating country s sovereign currency will remain legal currency 
after june   the euro will be the sole legal tender for the participating countries 
a significant amount of uncertainty exists as to the interpretation of certain euro regulations and the effect that the euro will have on the marketplace  including its impact on currency exchange rate risk  pricing  competition  contracts  information systems and taxation 
during  the company derived approximately of its revenues from sales of the thinprep system to customers in countries which have converted to the euro 
the company is currently evaluating euro related issues and the impact that the introduction of the euro may have on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to take appropriate actions based on the results of its evaluation 
the company has not yet determined the costs of addressing euro related issues  but does not expect such costs to be material 
because the company s evaluation of euro related issues is at an early stage and is ongoing  however  there can be no assurance that such issues and their related costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
