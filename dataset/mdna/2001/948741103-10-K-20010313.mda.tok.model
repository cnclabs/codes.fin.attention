page results of operations rental revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in and by  or million  from million in of these increases  property acquisitions and new development contributed million in and million in the remaining portion of these increases is due to activity at our existing properties 
occupancy of our shopping centers increased to at december  from at the end of occupancy of our industrial portfolio increased slightly from at the end of to at december  and occupancy of the total portfolio increased from to at year end 
these increases are due to a generally strong leasing environment in most of the markets in which we operate  and more specifically  the leasing of a substantial portion of large vacancies that arose in the latter part of in  we completed  renewals or new leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of the amortized portion of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged 
occupancy of our total portfolio decreased from at december  to at the end of in  we completed renewals or new leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of the amortized portion of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged 
interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the increase in income in and was due to the funding of interim loans to our joint venture partners  pending the completion of permanent financing with third parties 
interest income should decrease in as this permanent financing was finalized during direct costs and expenses of operating our properties ie  operating and ad valorem tax expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during these periods 
overall  direct operating costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues were in  and depreciation and amortization have increased to million in from million in and million in  also as a result of the properties acquired and developed during these periods 
general and administrative expense has increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are due to normal compensation increases as well as increases in staffing necessitated by the growth in the portfolio

the gain on sale of million in was due primarily to the sale of acres of undeveloped land and an interest in certain industrial properties to american national insurance company 
page funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of wri s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations is calculated as follows in thousands numerator net income available to common shareholders 



   depreciation and amortization 










   gain on sales of property

   effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  was issued 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure the instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends upon its intended use 
wri adopted the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal year based upon valuations at december   wri would record liabilities totaling million with a corresponding entry to other comprehensive income at that date relating to interest rate swaps that have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the effect of this pronouncement on net income and funds from operations will be insignificant 
page in december  the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements was issued 
this bulletin requires that revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales be recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
implementation of this bulletin reduced revenue by an estimated 
million in and will have no effect on in july  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures 
this consensus requires that the proportionate share method of presenting balance sheet and income statement information for partnerships and other ventures in which entities have joint interest and control be discontinued  except in limited circumstances 
wri was required to conform with the guidance provided in this issue effective december  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in this annual report have been restated to conform with the revised presentation 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting wri s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wri uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose wri to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose wri to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   wri had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
we also had variable rate notes receivable totaling million at year end 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  page
