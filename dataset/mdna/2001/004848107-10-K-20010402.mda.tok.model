item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate  depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed at item description of business factors that may influence future results 
during  we operated in three reportable segments consulting and development services  utility solutions and computer hardware sales 
consulting and development services sales in our consulting and development services segment remained stable  with an increase in israeli sales offset by decreased domestic sales 
gross profit margins in this segment improved due to increased fixed price embedded software consulting sales in israel  more than offsetting the increased labor costs resulting from of the relative shortage of qualified programmers and engineers 
although this shortage has recently eased  we expect that the competitive marketplace for qualified engineers will continue to adversely affect margins in and future periods 
utility solutions this segment has been evolving since we first began to develop and market two way interactive communications solutions for utilities in in january  we acquired certain assets and licensed intellectual property from lucent technologies  inc and began to market the comverge distributed connection to commercial and industrial customers in the us in august we acquired the scientific atlanta control systems business division  including its line of load control products and maingate gateway system 
sales increased in the first half of  primarily as a result of sales of load control products 
during the second half of sales declined  particularly sales of our load control products 
we believe that this decline reflects the seasonal nature of load control products sales  with most purchases being made in preparation for the summer air conditioning season  as well as the fact that sales during the first half of were particularly strong due to a large backlog of orders during scientific atlanta s phase out from the load control business 
we do not expect significant improvement in sales before the third quarter of computer hardware sales and gross profits in this segment increased dramatically in although gross profit margins in were slightly higher than those in  we expect the increasingly competitive market will cause downward pressure on our gross profit margin in results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of our total sales

interest income and interest expense 
the increase in interest income to million in from  in is due to the interest income on the investment of the proceeds from the sale of our tower investment in january and from our long term deposit

income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased to  in from  in the tax expense is comprised primarily of foreign taxes 
we establish valuation allowances against virtually all deferred tax assets  as we believe that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized

gross profit increased by to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in utility solutions segment gross profit from the aforementioned increase in sales 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in computer hardware gross profits  due to the aforementioned decrease in segment sales  coupled with a decrease in gross profit margins in this segment to in from in as a result of a shift in sales to lower margin customers and products

losses from discontinued operations 
the loss in was comprised of equity losses from our investment in tower 
losses in included equity losses of and income taxes of million 
these taxes represent israeli taxes associated with the anticipated repatriation of earnings from our israeli subsidiary that held our investment in tower 
prior to the signing of a definitive sale agreement in december  earnings of this israeli subsidiary were considered permanently invested and  accordingly  no income taxes were provided on such earnings 
in  the loss was comprised of a write down of our tower investment by million to reflect tower s share price as of december   in addition to million in equity losses from tower 
in  the loss also included million of losses from the phd division activity  which was sold during that year 
gain from sale of discontinued operations 
in  we recognized a gain from the sale of our phd division  which was sold during that year 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  including million cash  cash equivalents and short term deposits 
the increase in cash and short term deposits was due to net proceeds of million from the sale of our tower investment  received in january and the net proceeds from our sale of the cinnetic division of million in august in addition we have a long term deposit of million securing our comverge subsidiary s long term bank debt in the same amount 
this debt replaced short term debt  previously used to finance the acquisition by this subsidiary of the scientific atlanta control systems business division in in february we utilized a portion of the tower proceeds to redeem million of our debentures for million in cash 
the  balance of the debentures was converted into  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our tower investment for operations to reduce the balance of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in september we announced the decision to repurchase up to  of our shares 
in we repurchased a total of  shares for a total of million 
we believe we have adequate liquidity to finance our operating activities and corporate expenses for fiscal and the foreseeable future  including debt service and planned capital expenditures 
dsi israel s increased profitability in enabled it to reduce its usage of available bank credit lines 
bank credit lines currently available to dsi israel total approximately million  denominated in nis and bearing interest at an average interest rate of the israeli prime rate plus per annum 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
as of december   dsi israel was utilizing  of these lines of credit 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations in and  the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was at relatively the same level as inflation in israel 
a majority of our sales are denominated in dollars 
the remaining portion is primarily denominated in nis  linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed  through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
the majority of our expenses are in dollars or dollar linked nis and virtually all the remaining expenses were in nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar  should it be significantly different from the rate of inflation  since most transactions are linked to or are denominated in us dollars 
this adverse effect principally arises with respect to its severance pay obligations and also with respect to the unbilled portion of long term projects 
as of december   virtually all of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis  and the net amount of such monetary assets and liabilities was not material 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our financial instruments  including derivatives  if any 
a financial instrument is defined as cash  evidence of an ownership interest in an entity  or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual obligation either to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument to or from a second entity 
examples of financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  loans  investments  trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  options and forward contracts 
the disclosures below include  among other matters  the nature and terms of derivative transactions  information about significant concentrations of credit risk  and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values  due to the short maturity of such instruments 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to the company for debt and deposits with the similar terms and remaining maturities 
the fair value of the company s long term debt and long term deposits are not materially different from their carrying amounts 
the fair value of investments is estimated based on market value 
the estimation of fair value of the company s investments book value of  at december  was not practicable  although the company believes that the estimated fair values of such investments are not materially different from their book value 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term bank deposits  asset backed securities and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a majority of the company s cash equivalent deposits as well as its short and long term bank deposits is a major financial institution of high credit standing 
the counterparties to the company s asset backed securities consist of various major corporations of high credit standing 
the company does not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable were due from a us customer that pays its trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base
