item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview millennium pharmaceuticals  inc was founded in we incorporate large scale genetics  genomics  high throughput screening  and informatics in an integrated science and technology platform  which we apply primarily in discovering and developing proprietary therapeutic and diagnostic human healthcare products and services 
during  we expanded our operations through internal growth  additional strategic alliances and acquisitions 
we also hired additional staff in research and drug discovery  informatics  biotherapeutics and diagnostics prognostics  as well as in other support areas 
we currently derive our revenue primarily from payments from strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of products 
significant strategic alliances include the following two agreements with the wyeth ayerst division of american home products ahp in certain disorders of the central nervous system and in bacterial diseases  respectively  an agreement with bayer  ag bayer in cardiovascular disease  and certain areas of oncology  osteoporosis  pain  liver fibrosis  hematology and viral infections  a research alliance and technology transfer agreement with monsanto company monsanto in plant agriculture  a technology transfer agreement and joint development and commercialization agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis in inflammatory disease  millennium and ilex partners  lp m i  a joint venture partnership with ilex products  inc ilex for development of the campath registered trademark alemtuzumab product candidate  a monoclonal antibody for use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  for which the partnership is currently seeking approval from the food and drug administration fda  and an agreement  through our joint venture partnership with ilex  with schering ag for distribution of the campath registered trademark product candidate 
in addition  we have a number of other strategic alliances 
our strategic alliance agreements have provided us with various combinations of equity investments  license fees and research funding  and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon our attainment of research and regulatory milestones and royalty and or profit sharing payments based on sales of any products resulting from the collaborations 
in december  the oncologic drugs advisory committee odac to the fda recommended accelerated approval of m i s campath registered trademark product candidate 
in february  m i received a class i complete response letter from the fda 
in the letter  the fda indicated that the timeframe for accelerated approval has been extended for a day period 
m i expects to complete ongoing discussions with the fda on final package labeling and design of a post marketing confirmatory study for the campath registered trademark product during this time 
our goal is to become an integrated biopharmaceutical company 
as a result  we expect to continue to pursue additional alliances and to consider joint development  merger  or acquisition opportunities that may provide us with access to products on the market or in later stages of commercial development than those represented within our current programs 
we expect that we will incur increasing expenses and may incur increasing operating losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to expansion of facilities and research and development programs and as a result of our efforts to advance acquired products or our own development programs to commercialization 
our results of operations for any period may not be indicative of future results because our revenues under strategic alliance and licensing arrangements and from product sales  to the extent that we receive product sales in future periods  may fluctuate from period to period or year to year 
results of operations years ended december  and december  effective october   we changed our method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
previously  we had recognized revenue relating to non refundable  up front  license and milestone payments and certain research funding payments from our strategic partners in accordance with the contract 
under the new accounting method adopted retroactively to january   we now recognize revenue from non refundable  up front  license and milestone payments  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of the research contract 
when payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when earned 
in addition  when appropriate  we recognize revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services performed during the research contract 
the cumulative effect of the change resulted in a charge to income of million and relates to revenue previously recognized by us that was deferred into future periods 
the pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations were calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactively to prior periods 
included in revenue is million of revenue that was recognized in prior years relating to the adoption of sab the amount of revenue to be recognized in future years that was included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle is million  million  million and 
million in   and  respectively 
the following discussions relating to the net loss attributable to common stockholders and revenue for the year ended december  the period and the net loss attributable to common stockholders and revenue for the year ended december  the period reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
for the period  we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share for the period 
operating results for the period represent the first reported year of fully combined revenues and expenses related to our acquisition of leukosite  inc leukosite and five months of combined revenues and expenses related to our acquisition of cambridge discovery chemistry ltd 
cdc 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase is primarily attributable to revenue from a new alliance with aventis  other new alliance revenue and an increase in the revenue recognized under the bayer alliance during the period 
revenues may fluctuate from period to period and we cannot assure you that strategic alliance agreements will continue for their initial term or beyond 
research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to our continued investment in clinical trials and preclinical product candidates  increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased technology license payments and increased professional fees 
research and development expenses for the period represent the first reported year of fully combined expenses related to the acquisition of leukosite and five months of combined expenses related to the acquisition of cdc 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as we add personnel and expand our research and development activities to accommodate our existing and future strategic alliances and development efforts to move our product candidates to commercialization 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel associated with the expansion and increased complexity of our operations and business development efforts 
general and administrative expenses for the period represent the first reported year of fully combined expenses related to the acquisition of leukosite and five months of combined expenses related to the acquisition of cdc 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we add capabilities to support the further advancement of our development efforts 
on december   we acquired leukosite for an aggregate purchase price of million  primarily consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of assumed leukosite options and warrants 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets to specific intangible assets and goodwill 
we are amortizing intangible assets and goodwill on a straight line basis over four years 
amortization expense for the period of million is primarily related to the leukosite acquisition 
we also recorded a one time  noncash charge to operations in of million for acquired in process research and development 
with respect to the value of the purchased research and development  we considered  among other factors  the research and development project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the projected date to market and the estimated useful life 
we then discounted the respective after tax cash flows back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
as of december   the status of our research and development projects acquired is expected to continue in line with our original estimates set forth in the period 
our ability to successfully complete the research and development projects will be dependent upon numerous factors over which we may have limited or no control 
if we do not successfully develop these projects  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process technology 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may also become impaired 
on july   we acquired cdc  a subsidiary of oxford molecular group  plc  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to intangible assets  resulting in million of specific intangible assets and million of goodwill 
the acquisition did not result in an in process research and development charge 
we are amortizing intangible assets and goodwill on a straight line basis over four years 
we expect the acquisition to provide us with the capabilities in medicinal and computational chemistry necessary to accelerate our downstream drug discovery efforts 
through our acquisition of leukosite  we became a party to a joint venture partnership m i with ilex for development of the campath registered trademark product candidate 
under the terms of the partnership  we are required to fund fifty percent of m i s working capital requirements 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
equity in operations of the joint venture was a loss of million for the period 
the loss is primarily attributable to pre product launch marketing and sales activities 
interest income increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher level of invested funds due to net proceeds from our public stock offering in october of million including the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option and million in net proceeds from our convertible debt offering which closed in january interest expense increased to million for the period from million for the period due to increased obligations arising primarily from the convertible debt 
during the period  we paid an aggregate of million in cash to certain holders of our convertible notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during the period 
the minority interest in includes the minority shareholder interest of becton  dickinson and company becton dickinson in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  millennium predictive medicine  inc mpmx 
on june   we acquired the outstanding preferred and common stock of our mpmx subsidiary that we did not already own  making mpmx a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mpmx minority interest acquired from becton dickinson 
the minority interest of million in includes the minority shareholder interest of eli lilly and company lilly in the net loss for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  millennium biotherapeutics  inc mbio  as well as the minority shareholder interest of becton dickinson in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  mpmx 
in october  we issued lilly approximately  shares of millennium common stock in exchange for all mbio shares owned by it 
in december  we merged mbio with and into millennium 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mbio minority interest acquired from lilly 
years ended december  and december  the following discussions relating to the net loss attributable to common stockholders and revenue for the period and the net loss and revenue for the year ended december  the period reflect pro forma results as if we had followed sab from our inception 
for the period we had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million or per basic and diluted share  as compared to a net loss of million or per basic share and diluted share for the period 
revenue under strategic alliances increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase is primarily attributable to a full year of revenue under the bayer alliance as compared to two months of bayer revenue in the period 
research and development expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  costs of external collaborations and increased equipment depreciation 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses for additional management and administrative personnel  as well as to increased facilities expenses  consulting  and other professional fees associated with the expansion and increased complexity of our operations and business development efforts 
on december   we acquired leukosite for an aggregate purchase price of million primarily consisting of  shares of common stock and  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of leukosite options and warrants 
we recorded the transaction as a purchase for accounting purposes and the consolidated financial statements include leukosite s operating results from the date of the acquisition 
we allocated the purchase price  based upon an independent valuation  to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net tangible assets allocated to in process research and development  assembled workforce  core technology and goodwill 
we are amortizing amounts allocated to goodwill  assembled workforce  and core technology on a straight line basis over a period of four years 
the amortization expense related to these intangibles was million 
we incurred a one time  noncash charge to operations in of million for acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired in process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that  at the time of the acquisition  had no alternative future use and for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the cost approach was used to value assembled workforce 
this approach establishes the fair value of an asset by calculating the recruiting and loss of productivity costs avoided by obtaining a pre existent  trained  and fully efficient team 
the income approach was used to establish the fair values of core technology and in process research and development 
this approach establishes the fair value of an asset by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
with respect to the value of purchased research and development  we considered  among other factors  the research and development project s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the projected date to market and the estimated useful life 
the respective after tax cash flows were then discounted back to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rates used in the leukosite analysis ranged from to  depending upon the risk profile of the asset 
we believed and continue to believe that the assumptions used to value the acquired intangibles were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
we cannot assure you  however  that the underlying assumptions we used to estimate projected revenues  development costs or profitability  or other events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the in process technology we acquired from leukosite consisted of five significant research and development projects with values assigned of million to million for each project 
these include humanized monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia  inflammatory bowel disease and the prevention of post ischemic reperfusion  small molecule chemotherapeutic agents  and a small molecule compound for treatment of bronchial asthma 
acquired in process technologies related to preclinical projects consisted of treatments primarily for inflammatory and autoimmune conditions and diseases  as well as treatments for asthma and allergies and were assigned a value of million 
through the acquisition date  leukosite had spent approximately million on in process research and development projects 
we expect to incur approximately million to million for each of the four remaining significant projects and approximately million for all of the projects in preclinical development to develop the in process technology into commercially viable projects 
the estimated stage of completion for acquired research and development projects ranged from to 
of the five projects acquired  one project reached completion in late with the filing of a bla  while the others  which are in various stages of phase i and phase ii clinical trials  are expected to reach completion in through the first of the molecules comprising the preclinical development portfolio is expected to reach completion in to successfully complete the aforementioned projects we will be required to undertake and complete a number of significant activities  including product validation  the successful completion of clinical trials and governmental regulatory approvals 
our ability to successfully complete the research and development projects will be dependent upon numerous factors over which we may have limited or no control 
if these projects are not successfully developed  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process technology 
additionally  the value of the other intangible assets acquired may also become impaired 
interest income increased to million for the period from million for the period 
the increase resulted from an increase in our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense increased to million for the period from million for the period due to increased capital lease obligations 
the minority interest of million in includes the minority shareholder interest of lilly in the net loss for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  mbio  as well as the minority shareholder interest of becton dickinson in the net income for the period of our then majority owned subsidiary  mpmx 
in october  we issued lilly approximately  shares of millennium common stock in exchange for all mbio shares owned by it 
in december  we merged mbio with and into millennium 
we recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of million in relating to the excess of the fair value of our common stock over the carrying value of the mbio minority interest acquired from lilly 
the minority interest of million in represents the entire net loss of mbio 
this loss is attributed completely to the minority stockholder because the minority stockholder provided all equity funding for mbio during liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of approximately billion from december  this excludes million of interest bearing marketable securities classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet  which serve as collateral for letters of credit securing leased facilities 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily due to million of proceeds from sales of common stock and exercises of warrants  million of net proceeds from the convertible debt offering  million of proceeds from employee stock purchases relating to the exercise of options  offset by cash outflows of million for operating activities  million relating to the acquisition of cdc  purchases of million of property and equipment and other long term assets  and million to pay capital lease obligations 
in january  we completed a sale  pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  of million of convertible subordinated notes due january  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment  unless previously repurchased or redeemed by us under certain circumstances 
under the terms of the notes  we are required to make semi annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the notes on january and july of each year 
to date  all required interest payments have been made 
the net proceeds of this offering will be used for working capital and other corporate purposes including financing our growth  accelerating the expansion of our technology platform  developing products  including conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials  and acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that complement or expand our business 
during the period  we paid an aggregate of million in cash to certain holders of our convertible notes in order to induce the conversion of their notes into our common stock 
these cash payments were expensed during the period 
these conversions resulted in the retirement of million of outstanding principal of our convertible notes  the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock  and the reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs of million to additional paid in capital 
on june   we entered into an alliance with aventis covering the joint development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  joint development of new drug discovery technologies  transfer of key elements of our technology platform to aventis to enhance its existing capabilities  and purchase of an equity interest in us by aventis 
in north america  we have agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing  marketing and manufacturing products arising from the alliance  as well as profits 
outside of north america  aventis is responsible for developing and marketing products arising from the alliance  with a royalty obligation to us 
under a technology transfer agreement  we agreed to provide aventis with rights to our drug discovery technologies in exchange for payments of up to million over a five year period 
under an investment agreement  aventis agreed to invest million in our common stock 
as part of this million equity investment  aventis made a million stock purchase in the third quarter of and made a million stock purchase in january aventis is required to make an additional million stock purchase in july on august   we entered into lease agreements  relating to two buildings to be constructed for laboratory and office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the rent obligation for each building is expected to commence on the earlier of a september  or october   respectively or b the date on which we commence occupancy of the respective building 
both leases are for a term of seventeen years 
we are responsible for a portion of the construction costs for both buildings 
the cost to complete one of the buildings is expected to be approximately million 
the other building is currently in the design phase and construction costs are currently being estimated 
rent is calculated on an escalating scale ranging from approximately million  per building per year  to approximately million  per building per year 
on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
on october  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option with respect to an additional  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to us of an additional million 
we plan to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and other corporate purposes including financing our growth  accelerating the expansion of our technology platform  developing products  including conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials  and acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that complement or expand our business 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal taxable income expiring in through and million to offset future state taxable income expiring in through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate realization of such prior losses  no benefit has been recognized in the financial statements as of december  we would allocate any subsequently recognized tax benefits to operations  goodwill and additional paid in capital 
moreover  our ability to utilize these losses in future years may be limited under the change of stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
we believe that existing cash  our investment securities and the anticipated cash payments from our current strategic alliances will be sufficient to support our operations and fund our capital commitments for the near term 
our actual future cash requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including the progress of our disease research programs  the number and breadth of these programs  achievement of milestones under strategic alliance arrangements  acquisitions  our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  the progress of our development efforts and the development efforts of our strategic partners  and our ability to repay our long term debt at maturity 
we may require additional financing in the future  which we may seek to raise through public or private security offerings  debt financings  additional strategic alliances or other financing sources 
however  additional financing  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements may not be available when needed or  if available  such financing may not be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the effective date of this statement was deferred to fiscal years beginning after june  by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
we believe the adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a significant effect on our financial statements 
subsequent events in january  aventis made a million purchase of millennium common stock pursuant to the investment agreement between aventis and us 
in february  we entered into an agreement for lease  relating to a building to be constructed for laboratory and office space in cambridge  england 
the lease is expected to have a year term and to commence in we are responsible for a portion of the construction costs  which we estimate to be approximately million 
rent is expected to be approximately million per year and is subject to market adjustments at the end of the th  th and th years 
in february  m i received a class i complete response letter from the fda relating to the campath registered trademark product 
in the letter  the fda indicated that the timeframe for accelerated approval has been extended for a day period 
m i expects to complete ongoing discussions with the fda on final package labeling and design of a post marketing confirmatory study for the campath registered trademark product during this time 
in march  we entered into a strategic alliance with abbott laboratories 
this alliance is for a five year term  and is primarily for collaborative research and development in the area of metabolic diseases 
we and abbott have agreed to share equally the cost of developing  manufacturing and marketing products on a worldwide basis 
our arrangement with abbott also includes a technology exchange and development agreement and an equity investment by abbott  under which we are eligible to receive up to million 
as part of this million equity investment  abbott has agreed to make an initial investment of million in april and additional investments totalling million in seven quarterly installments from later in through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the interest rates on our convertible subordinated notes and capital lease obligations are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments which would require disclosure under this item
