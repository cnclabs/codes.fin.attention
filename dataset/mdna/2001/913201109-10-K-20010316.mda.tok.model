general matrix bancorp was formed in june when the founding shareholders of matrix financial and united financial  two of our subsidiaries  exchanged all of their outstanding capital stock for shares of our stock in a series of transactions that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in september  we acquired dona ana savings and loan association  fsb  which was subsequently renamed matrix capital bank 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we formed matrix asset management  formerly united special services  in june and united capital markets in december in february  we acquired the vintage group in a pooling of interests and  accordingly  no goodwill was recorded and our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods have been restated 
additionally  we acquired abs in march the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
on august   we sold the stock of united capital markets to one of the officers of that company  as previously disclosed 
additionally  on august   matrix financial  our mortgage banking operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bank 
the principal components of our revenues consist of o net interest income recorded by matrix bank  o loan administration fees generated by matrix financial  o brokerage and consulting and disposition services fees realized by united financial and matrix asset management  respectively  o loan origination fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights generated by matrix bank and matrix financial  o trust service fees generated by sterling trust  and  o school service fees generated by abs 
our results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and the effect of these changes on our interest spreads  the volume of loan originations  mortgage loan prepayments and the value of mortgage servicing portfolios 
comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and net income  return on average equity 
net income decreased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year on a per share basis  net income was 
per share for fiscal year and for fiscal year return on average equity decreased to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the decreases in net income  earnings per share and return on average equity were caused primarily by the substantial increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  which resulted from the higher interest rate environment of fiscal year as compared to fiscal year additionally  we incurred losses related to loans that we acquired under a previously existing purchase repurchase facility  as well as related to the settlement of the harbor financial mortgage corporation bankruptcy

net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year our net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased only slightly in spite of the million  or  increase in our interest earning assets 
the reason for the small increase in net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses was due to the interest rate environment  which caused the cost of our interest bearing liabilities to increase significantly more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points  whereas the yield on our interest earning assets only increased basis points between the comparable periods 
the increase in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities caused our net interest margin to decrease to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year and our interest rate spread to decrease to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year as noted above  the compression in our net interest margin was a result of the interest rate environment during and our continued philosophy of acquiring adjustable rate mortgages

     change in net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses      asset and liability management general 
a significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  we strive to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what we believe to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of our performance due to changes in interest rates 
we constantly attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
we have responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include o utilizing mortgage servicing rights as a source of noninterest income and as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising interest rate environment 
increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans  o focusing on noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to our mortgage servicing rights  o increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services  real estate disposition and school business services  o maintaining a wholesale loan origination operation 
wholesale originations provide a form of hedge against the balance of mortgage servicing rights 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments of the underlying loans 
during this same environment  however  the volume of loan originations generally increases  o originating and purchasing adjustable rate mortgages and selling newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages in the secondary market  o increasing emphasis on the origination of construction and commercial real estate lending  including sba loans  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  o increasing retail deposits  which are less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other funding sources  o pursuing strategic acquisitions or alliances that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund our investing activities  o using matrix bank as the settlement bank for settlement and clearing services offered by sterling trust and matrix settlement clearance services to generate low cost deposits  and o hedging segments of our servicing portfolio and selling forward commitments on our loan pipeline 
lending activities 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities

as part of asset and liability management  we monitor nonperforming assets on a monthly basis 
nonperforming assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned

we accrue for interest on government sponsored loans such as federal housing administration insured and veteran s administration guaranteed loans which are past due or more days  as the majority of the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
nonaccrual mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   at december   at december   at december and at december  a significant portion of the increases in and can be primarily attributed to several portfolios 
the first is a sub prime residential portfolio that we acquired on a scheduled interest and scheduled principal remittance with full recourse to the seller servicer 
in october  however  the seller servicer declared bankruptcy and the servicing was transferred to us 
the total principal balance of the sub prime portfolio was million at december  and approximately million was or more days delinquent at that time 
associated with these loans  we have a  specific reserve 
the second portfolio was principally associated with the harbor settlement and consists of million of loans at december   of which million loans were days or more delinquent at that time 
recorded against the million of loans  we have million of discounts 
the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans and school financing in and is primarily the result of our origination of tax exempt financing for charter schools for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
several of the charter schools for which we have provided financing have encountered enrollment and or state funding delays  which has caused them to become delinquent on their obligations to us 
with the start of the new fiscal year for the schools  which began on july   and through the efforts of abs employees who have worked with several of the schools on their cash flow issues  we were able to remove several schools from nonaccrual status during offsetting the decrease in nonaccrual commercial loans and school financing related to charter schools were several sba loans that went into nonaccrual status during the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
we generally purchase such loans at discounts and  in limited instances  receive recourse from the seller to further reduce our risk of loss associated with the loans nonaccrual status 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were million  of which million  or  were nonaccrual loans 
the percentage of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to nonaccrual loans varies widely due to the nature of our portfolio of mortgage loans  which are collateralized primarily by residential real estate 
we analyze the collateral for each nonperforming mortgage loan to determine potential loss exposure 
in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and valuation losses

credit card loans accounted for  and of our total loan portfolio as of december   and  respectively 
the majority of our credit card portfolio was originated in and the balance of our unsecured credit card portfolio at december  was million 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is increased by the provision for loan and valuation losses which is charged to operations for particular loans where management considers ultimate collection to be questionable 
we evaluate all other loans as part of their respective categories and not on an individual basis 
each category of loans in the loan portfolio is assigned a loss factor based on o the assessed risk inherent in each loan category  o certain qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  o trends in the portfolio  o geographic and portfolio concentrations  o new products or markets  and o evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component and projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions 
these loss factors range from for federal housing administration veteran s administration loans guaranteed by the department of housing and urban development to for credit card loans 
additionally substandard and doubtful loans of homogeneous loan portfolios are assigned loss factors of to and  respectively 
we had million  million and million of impaired commercial loans and school financing at december    and  respectively 
we had no impaired loans as of december  and the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balance of loans in their respective categories  and the total for all categories determines our allowance for loan and valuation losses

the balance of the allowance for loan and valuation losses allocated to residential  multi family  commercial real estate  commercial  school financing and construction loans has increased mainly due to the increased outstanding loan principal balances in these loan categories 
in addition  we have increased our origination of non family loans  which are perceived to be higher risk and also is a contributor to the overall increase in the balance of the allowance 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb the inherent losses in the current loan portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of our earnings and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  mortgage servicing rights  and also related to its loan origination volumes  as well as the net interest income earned on its originated loans that are funded through warehouse lines of credit 
with the majority of matrix financial s operations being funded by matrix bank  this is a smaller risk to the company as compared to when matrix financial s operations were funded entirely by unaffiliated financial institutions 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster which reduces future servicing income  while in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
as it relates to matrix financial s lending activities  matrix financial originates residential mortgage loans  which are generally pre sold 
however  between the time that the loan is originated and sold to the ultimate investor  matrix financial earns interest income 
the loans are funded through the use of warehouse credit facilities or borrowings from matrix bank  both of which are generally priced based on short term interest rates 
therefore  the net interest income that is earned by matrix financial is generally dependent on the spread between long term mortgage rates and short term interest rates 
additionally  rising interest rate environments typically decrease loan origination volumes  whereas falling interest rate environments typically increase loan origination volumes 
we currently do not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  we are not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio is held for sale which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
the asset and liability committee establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the asset and liability committee is also involved in formulating our budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
due to the historical size of matrix bank s loan portfolio and the high degree of purchase and sale activity  the asset and liability committee has relied on the office of thrift supervision interest rate risk exposure report to assist in the overall monitoring of matrix bank s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the information and assumptions used in the office of thrift supervision exposure report as of december   a downward basis point shock over a twelve month period would decrease matrix bank s capital by approximately  and an upward basis point shock over a twelve month period would decrease matrix bank s capital by approximately 
as matrix bank grew to in excess of billion in total assets in  we can no longer rely on the office of thrift supervision reports to manage our interest rate risk 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services that assists us with our asset liability management 
we meet with this consulting firm quarterly to review the results of our interest rate risk analysis and to discuss strategies 
we are also researching various asset liability software packages for possible future acquisition by matrix bank 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and have increased our efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  commercial real estate loans  sba loans and limited consumer lending  which re price or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
the other significant asset that we invest in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from residential mortgage servicing rights respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease  in turn decreasing net interest income  the value of the mortgage servicing rights increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
it is important to note  however  that an equal increase or decrease in interest rates will not affect the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio equally 
a decrease in interest rates causes a greater reduction in the value of the portfolio as compared to the increase in value in the portfolio from an equal increase in interest rates 
another significant strategy that we focus on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in mortgage servicing rights  which generate no cost escrow deposits  sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs  and our investment in matrix settlement clearance services  which uses matrix bank as the clearing bank  which creates low cost deposits 
in the ordinary course of business  we make commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and hold originated loans until delivery to an investor 
inherent in this business are risks associated with changes in interest rates and the resulting change in the market value of the pipeline loans 
we mitigate this risk through the use of mandatory and best effort forward commitments to sell loans and mortgage backed securities 
as of december   we had million and million in pipeline and funded loans  respectively  offset with mandatory forward commitments of million and best effort forward commitments of million 
the market value of loans committed for sale is determined based on the related forward loan sale commitments 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas  we are required to treat substantially all mortgage loan commitments and loan sale commitments both mandatory and best effort as derivatives and record the fair value of those derivatives on the balance sheet and any subsequent changes in the fair value of those derivatives through current earnings 
as the changes in fair value of the loan commitments and the loan sale commitments are generally expected to offset one another  we do not anticipate any material impact to our future earnings from pipeline loans as a result of the adoption of sfas ownership of mortgage servicing rights exposes us to impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of our mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than we projected for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  we hedged a segment of our portfolio beginning in september we had identified and hedged million as of december  and million as of december  of our mortgage servicing portfolio using a program of exchange traded futures and options 
as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this document  we are currently not seeking hedge accounting treatment following our adoption of sfas on january  as a result  interest rate fluctuation will impact the value of our hedging instruments and the resulting change in value will be reflected in our current operating results 
under prior accounting methods  the gain or loss associated with the change in the value of the hedging instruments would be included as an adjustment in the basis of our investment in mortgage servicing rights 
following the adoption of sfas  economically  and from a cash flow perspective  we are in the same position as under the prior accounting method 
however  the recognition of the change in the value of the hedging instruments is required to be recognized currently in earnings as opposed to over the life of the servicing asset 
as a result  sfas may cause fluctuations in quarterly earnings that we did not incur under the prior accounting method 
the following tables represent  in tabular form  contractual balances of our on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair value of those on balance sheet financial instruments for the periods ended december  and the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as interest earning deposits  federal home loan bank stock and certain other deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we are very active in the secondary market as it relates to the purchase and sale of mortgage loans 
in the past  we have made the assumption that the entire portfolio of loans held for sale will mature in the first three years  as the total amount of loans sold generally represent a significant portion of our held for sale portfolio 
in the past year  loans sold as a percentage of the held for sale portfolio has decreased 
the total amount of loans sold by matrix bank in and approximated and  respectively  of matrix bank s total held for sale portfolio at december  and this proves our intent to sell the loans classified as held for sale  but no longer supports our three year maturity assumption 
we will now use a five year maturity assumption for all of matrix bank s held for sale loans and school financing in  and we will continue to use a one year maturity assumption for matrix financial s originated loans held for sale 
we also treat the federal home loan bank and revolving borrowings as long term in nature  as the continued availability of these amounts is anticipated indefinitely 
third party servicers service a portion of our loan portfolio  as a result  a portion of the information presented is based on the best available information 
for the most part  the carrying amounts of interest earning deposits  federal home loan bank stock  federal home loan bank borrowings and borrowed money approximate those assets and liabilities fair values 
the fair values of the loan portfolios for held for sale and held for investment are based on quoted market prices or outstanding commitments from investors 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in securitization transactions  adjusted for differences in loan characteristics 
the fair values of demand deposits are  by definition  equal to the amount payable upon demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected periodic maturities on time deposits 
mortgage servicing rights are not included in the tabular presentation  as the investment does not directly affect interest income 
as noted  however  earnings from mortgage servicing rights directly correlate with market risk as it relates to interest rate fluctuations 
we mitigate this risk through both the type of mortgage servicing rights acquired and hedging of mortgage servicing rights 
the loans underlying the servicing rights acquired tend to be more seasoned and have lower principal balances 
management believes that the more seasoned  lower balance servicing portfolios carry less prepayment risk than less seasoned  higher balance mortgage servicing  because the cost savings of refinancing a lower balance loan tend to be less than for a higher balance loan with a comparable interest rate 
we also believe that if a loan has been outstanding for a period of time and has been through several declining interest rate cycles without refinancing  the risk of prepayment in the future is less than a newly originated loan 
although significantly higher in and  the prepayment percentages which we have experienced over the past three years have been lower than experienced in the industry  as a whole 
the prepayment speeds for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
in the tables below  prepayment speeds of were used for all loan types to project expected cash flows

short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we rely heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the federal home loan bank for matrix bank  and matrix bank and unaffiliated financial institutions for matrix financial

calculations are based on daily averages where available and monthly averages otherwise 
a total of million of the federal home loan bank borrowings outstanding at december  were borrowed under a short option advance agreement with the federal home loan bank 
these short option advance borrowings have a term of ten years  but are callable by the federal home loan bank beginning after a six month or one year lockout period depending on the particular short option advance borrowing 
after the expiration of the lock out period  the short option advance borrowings are callable at three month intervals 
if the federal home loan bank exercises its call option on a short option advance borrowing  the federal home loan bank is required to offer replacement funding to us at a market rate of interest for the remaining term of the short option advance borrowing 
the interest rates on the short option advance borrowings ranged from to at december  and their possible call dates varied from february  to march  under the terms of the short option advance agreement  we are not permitted to prepay or otherwise retire a callable short option advance borrowing prior to the final maturity date

to date  our principal source of funding for our investing activities has been o secured senior debt provided by unaffiliated financial institutions  o the issuance of preferred securities through matrix bancorp capital trust i in july  o the issuance of senior notes in september  o a bank stock loan  and o our initial public offering 
as of december   matrix bancorp had million in indebtedness outstanding 
the borrowed funds have been used historically as capital injections to matrix bank  matrix financial and abs 
on december   matrix bancorp amended its bank stock loan agreement 
the amended bank stock loan agreement has two components  a million term loan and a revolving line of credit of million 
as of december   the balance of the term loan was million and there was no outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit 
as part of the amended agreement  the balance of the term loan was increased to million on january  the amended bank stock loan requires matrix bancorp to maintain total shareholders equity of million 
on july   matrix bancorp capital trust i  a delaware business trust formed by matrix bancorp  completed the sale of million of preferred securities 
matrix bancorp capital trust i also issued common securities to matrix bancorp and used the net proceeds from the offering to purchase million in principal amount of junior subordinated debentures of matrix bancorp due september  the junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of matrix bancorp capital trust i and are eliminated  along with the related income statement effects  in the consolidated financial statements 
we used the proceeds from the sale of the junior subordinated debentures to redeem our outstanding senior subordinated notes due july   to make contributions to matrix bank  matrix financial and abs to fund their respective operations  to redeem other higher interest rate indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes 
capitalized expenses associated with the offering of approximately million are included in other assets at december  and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the junior subordinated debentures 
the preferred securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly at an annual rate of of the stated liquidation amount of per preferred security 
we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of matrix bancorp capital trust i under the preferred securities 
the guarantee covers the quarterly distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the preferred securities  but only to the extent of funds held by matrix bancorp capital trust i 
the preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity of the junior subordinated debentures or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture 
we have the right to redeem the junior subordinated debentures  in whole or in part on or after september   at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
under the indenture  we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the scheduled payments on our junior debentures and trust preferred securities have not been made 
on september   we completed a registered debt offering of million in senior notes due  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
interest on the senior notes of is payable semi annually on march and september of each year  commenced on march   with a balloon payment for the entire principal balance due in september the senior notes require us to o maintain consolidated tangible equity capital of not less than million  and o meet the requirements necessary such that matrix bank will not be classified as other than well capitalized as defined by applicable regulatory guidelines 
additionally  the senior notes contain other covenants regarding certain restricted payments  incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock  liens  merger  consolidation or sale of assets and transactions with affiliates 
the trend of net cash used by our operating activities experienced over the reported periods results primarily from the growth at matrix bank 
we anticipate the trend of a net use of cash from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
this anticipation results from the expected growth  albeit less than our historical growth at matrix bank  which we believe will consist primarily of increased activity in the purchasing of loan portfolios and increased loan production projected at matrix financial 
however  due to liquidity and capital availability  we do not anticipate growth to be as significant as in prior periods 
matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are o retail deposits  o trust deposits  o custodial escrow balances  o brokered deposits  o federal home loan bank borrowings  o sales of loan portfolios  and o proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
contractual loan payments and net deposit inflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the federal home loan bank as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight and term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of million 
to increase its available liquidity  matrix bank swapped approximately million of residential loans during the first quarter of and million of residential loans during the third quarter of with the agencies in exchange for agency securities 
in combination  these securities had a balance of million at december  matrix bank is able to pledge these securities with the federal home loan bank at a higher advance rate 
additionally  the market for securities is more liquid than the market for whole loans 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance  as well as the level of prepayments which occur 
for a tabular presentation of the our short term borrowings  see asset and liability management short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
matrix bank s retail deposits principally consist of demand deposits and certificates of deposit 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in prevailing interest rates and competition 
matrix bank s retail deposits are obtained from areas in which it is located  as well as through an internet service 
therefore  its retail deposits are concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city  except for the internet deposits  which could be out of market retail deposits 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain in market deposits 
beginning in february  brokered deposits were accepted and have been utilized to support growth at matrix bank 
in pricing deposit rates  management considers profitability  the matching of term lengths with assets  the attractiveness to customers and rates offered by competitors 
matrix bank intends to continue its efforts to attract deposits as a primary source of funds to support its lending and investing activities

historically  matrix bank has increased its core capital through the retention of a portion of its earnings 
matrix bank s future growth is expected to be achieved through deposit growth  brokered deposits  borrowings from the federal home loan bank and custodial deposits from affiliates 
we anticipate that such growth will require additional capital 
the capital requirements related to the anticipated growth will in part be fulfilled through retention of earnings  potentially increasing our bank stock loan and future possible debt or equity offerings 
prior to matrix financial becoming a subsidiary of matrix bank  our principal source of funding for our servicing acquisition activities and working capital needs of matrix financial consisted of a line of credit facility and a working capital facility provided to matrix financial by an unaffiliated financial institution 
as noted earlier  effective august   matrix financial became a wholly owned subsidiary of matrix bank 
the contribution of matrix financial increased the capital of matrix bank by approximately million  which will provide capital for future growth at matrix bank 
in addition  effective august  through financing provided by matrix bank  matrix financial paid off its line of credit for the financing on its servicing acquisitions 
in addition  matrix financial paid off approximately million of higher costing borrowings under its purchase repurchase facilities and paid off its working capital facility 
matrix financial s principal source of funding for its loan origination business consists of a warehouse line of credit provided to matrix financial by matrix bank 
additionally  we have a warehouse line of credit provided to matrix financial and a sale repurchase facility provided to abs by unaffiliated financial institutions 
as of september   matrix financial s warehouse line of credit facility provided by an unaffiliated financial institution was amended 
it aggregates million  of which million was available to be utilized as of december  the september  warehouse agreement provides financing for matrix financial s wholesale lending without sub limits for such items as servicing acquisitions or working lines of credit 
at december   million was outstanding under the warehouse line at a weighted average interest rate of 
borrowings under the warehouse line of credit are secured by all of the mortgage loans funded with warehouse loan proceeds and bear interest at the libor rate plus a negotiated margin

borrowings under the sale repurchase facility are secured by all of the school financing funded with sale repurchase facility proceeds and bear interest at on the tax exempt school financing and on all other school financing 
our principal sources of funding for school financing are internal capital  a line of credit facility and a partnership trust with an unaffiliated financial institution 
amounts available under the line of credit facility and the partnership trust are at the lender s sole discretion 
during  and  the company placed tax exempt financing it originated to charter schools into several grantor trusts 
the trusts then issued class a certificates and class b certificates  with the class a certificates being sold to various third party investors under a private placement at a price of par 
the a certificates are guaranteed by a letter of credit issued by a third party investment bank  and the underlying financing 
the a certificates interest rate may be determined weekly  monthly or for a term for up to one year 
the interest rate and the term of the interest rate are determined by the remarking agent  which is also the investment bank 
generally  the trusts are short term in nature with an average life of one year or less 
the b certificates are owned in part by the company and in part by the investment bank 
the interest rate paid on the a certificates and the b certificates owned by the investment bank is considered the company s financing cost 
the approximate cost of the financing at december  and was and  respectively 
the interest that the company receives through its part ownership of the b certificates is tax exempt 
although the investment bank acts as a guarantor to the a certificates  the company provides limited recourse to the investment bank in all cases of loss or default 
due to the nature of the recourse and the ability of the a certificate holders to put the certificates to the trusts  the transactions have been accounted for as a secured financing 
matrix bank and sterling trust are restricted from paying dividends to matrix bancorp due to certain regulatory requirements

inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services 
we disclose the estimated fair market value of our financial instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

these statements become effective for the company on january   and generally  will affect the company in two principal areas  the hedging activities related to our investment in mortgage servicing rights and certain mortgage banking related commitments made by us in our wholesale mortgage operations  as well as forward loan sale commitments 
currently  in terms of unpaid principal amount  we have approximately of our million investment in mortgage servicing rights hedged through an investment in exchange traded futures and options 
we are currently unable to achieve hedge accounting treatment due to the systems and operational issues surrounding the tracking required to do so 
the financial impact to future earnings related to our hedging strategies on mortgage servicing rights  assuming that we continue to hedge with exchange traded futures and options and elect not to achieve hedge accounting treatment  can not be estimated and will largely depend on future market conditions 
based on an october fasb tentative conclusion  loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for resale pipeline will be accounted for as derivatives under sfas additionally  we determined that both our mandatory and best effort forward loan sale commitments meet the sfas derivative definition  and accordingly  are required to be recorded at fair value as an asset or liability upon adoption of sfas since the fair values of the pipeline and the forward loan sale commitments both mandatory and best effort used to economically hedge all or a portion of the pipeline are generally expected to offset each other  we do not believe the adoption of sfas  with respect to these instruments  will result in a material impact to our operations in the first quarter of and prospectively 
in addition to the pipeline loans  we also use both mandatory and best effort loan sale commitments to hedge our originated loans held for sale 
to the extent that we do not receive hedge accounting treatment related to our originated loans held for sale  we will be required to record these loans at the lower of aggregate cost or market with the corresponding loans sale commitments recorded at fair value 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  that replaces  in its entirety  sfas sfas revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures 
sfas is effective for transfers occurring after march  and the expanded disclosure requirements regarding securitizations and collateral are effective for fiscal years ended after december  we believe that the adoption of sfas on april   will have no material impact on our net income
