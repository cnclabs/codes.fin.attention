item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information on the results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and and the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and the financial statements and the notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
the profitability of the company s operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to the average realized prices of oil  gas and electricity sold  the type and volume of oil and gas produced and electricity generated and the results of acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
the average realized prices for oil  natural gas and electricity will fluctuate from one period to another due to regional market conditions and other factors  while oil prices will also be strongly influenced by world supply and demand 
the aggregate amount of oil and gas produced may fluctuate based on the success of development and exploitation of oil and gas reserves pursuant to current reservoir management 
the cost of natural gas used in the company s steaming operations and electrical generation  production rates  labor  maintenance expenses and production taxes are expected to be the principal influences on operating costs 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company may fluctuate from period to period based on the foregoing principal factors  among others 
results of operations net income for the year was million  up and  respectively  from million in and million in net income rose to million in the fourth quarter of from million in the fourth quarter of results for the year represented the highest net income  cash flow and production ever achieved by the company in any fiscal year and the fourth quarter was the sixth quarter in a row of increasing net income 
record net income for the year and the fourth quarter were primarily related to record production volumes sold at historically high oil prices 
the following table presents certain operating data for the years ended december   and net production boe d    per boe average sales price operating costs production taxes

boe d barrels of oil equivalent per day operating income from oil and gas producing operations of million was up million  or  from million in and up million  or from million in the improvement in compared with both and was due to higher oil prices and higher production  partially offset by higher operating costs 
the average price received per boe in was  dramatically higher than in and the historical low of in and represented the highest average price ever for the company s hydrocarbon production 
these prices are net of hedging costs of and

for these three years dramatically demonstrate the high degree of price volatility for the company s crude oil 
the second factor which increased the company s operating income for the year was the increase in production volumes achieved by the company 
the company achieved production on a boe d basis for of  up from  in and  in on a percentage basis  these results were a and increase over and levels  respectively 
the company s purchase of the placerita properties in february  which currently produce approximately  boe d  and total company development costs of over million in and were the primary contributing factors to the production increases over levels 
operating costs per barrel in were  up from for and in the largest factors in the increase in compared to was a substantial increase in the price of natural gas used to fire the company s cogeneration facilities and conventional steam generators  the cost of running conventional generators close to capacity  the added cost of operating the company s marginal producers and certain environmental costs  d seismic costs and general cost increases in contractor services 
gas prices mmbtu averaged in  up and from in and in  respectively 
effective december   average gas costs for the company reached per mmbtu 
the price of natural gas at the socal border broke out of its long term historical linkage of approximating the nymex henry hub hh price 
in december  the socal border price exceeded the hh price by approximately mmbtu  and has continued to average over mmbtu above hh 
this phenomena is having significant negative impacts on heavy oil production in california and has significantly contributed to escalating electricity prices in the western united states 
due to these unprecedented  extraordinarily high natural gas prices  the company has curtailed most of its conventional steam generation 
high natural gas prices have continued into the first quarter of and have rendered conventional steam generation uneconomic even at the current strong oil prices 
the company intends to resume operation of these steam generators as soon as it is economic to do so 
the company s cogeneration facilities operated close to of the time  not covered by scheduled outages  for all of the company s cogeneration facilities sell power under standard offer contracts which link electricity payments to the price of natural gas at the socal border 
thus  the economics of producing steam via cogeneration facilities under these contracts is superior to conventional steam generation 
the much publicized california electricity crisis  with california s two largest utilities pg e and edison nearing bankruptcy  has negatively impacted berry and its operations 
edison failed to pay berry for november and december power deliveries  which were due in early january and february  respectively 
in addition  they also failed to pay for january deliveries which were due in early march 
pg e made full payments for november and only partial payments  of approximately  for december and january deliveries 
effective february   management determined that it was not in the company s best interest to operate its mw facility at its south midway sunset field nor one of its mw units at placerita 
in addition  effective february   the company s mw facility  also located at its south midway sunset field was also shut down 
while the company s future thermal oil production will suffer as a result of the significant withdrawal of steam from the oil reservoir  the company will not allow its strong financial condition to materially deteriorate while waiting for a political solution to california s much publicized electricity crisis 
the company is vigorously pursuing every opportunity to restart its cogeneration facilities and sell its power to a creditworthy purchaser 
the company implemented a record capital budget in the year of million 
of this total  million was spent on well development and facility enhancements 
during  new wells were drilled  including horizontal wells and workovers were completed on existing wells 
as was discussed above  these expenditures were instrumental in improving production to over  barrels per day at year end and should result in increasing the ultimate recovery of oil from the company s properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a on a per barrel basis increased to  up from in and in the increase from prior years  which is calculated on a units of production basis  was primarily due to production acceleration achieved through increased steaming and development activity and the higher capital program 
the company believes that its dd a rate per barrel for will be similar or slightly higher than its rate 
general general and administrative g a expenses in were million  up and from million in and million in on a per barrel basis  these results equate to in  up from in and 
in the primary reasons for the increase were higher salaries  the hiring of additional employees and higher legal fees  the majority of which related to a lawsuit that was settled in the first quarter of and which arose from a company that berry purchased in in  the company reduced salaries  staff and numerous other costs to preserve cash flow in the low oil price environment 
these measures resulted in very low  but unsustainable g a costs on a per barrel basis 
interest expense fell to million in from million in  but remained higher than the million experienced in berry acquired certain properties in the placerita field in los angeles county  california in january of the financing of those properties resulted in higher interest costs in the company aggressively reduced its total debt from million at december  to just million at december  this reduction  partially offset by higher interest rates  resulted in the reduced interest expense experienced in compared with results 
in early  the company increased its borrowing to million to ensure liquidity during this period of nonpayment for electricity deliveries by utilities and higher natural gas prices  to pay an annual price based royalty on one of its properties and for other general purposes 
even though the company s pre tax net income was up sharply in versus and  the company invested heavily in the development of its thermally enhanced oil recovery eor projects  both through capital expenditures and increased steam injection volumes  thus  the company earned significant eor tax credits 
this is the third consecutive year that the company has achieved an effective tax rate below  versus the statutory rate of 
the company believes it will continue to earn significant eor tax credits in the future and have an effective tax rate well below 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during  the company aggressively reduced its long term debt by million 
as a result  working capital at december  was negative million  down from positive million in and million in net cash provided by operations was million  a company record and and higher than million in and million in the company employed these resources to fund its million capital program  reduce debt by million  pay dividends of million and make a million acquisition 
crude oil prices remain very attractive and  while the company has identified significant development opportunities  the company intends to postpone the majority of those projects until the company can restart its cogeneration facilities and inject that steam into the oil reservoirs 
the budget focuses on further development of the company s core properties and development of certain underdeveloped portions of its placerita area properties 
the company has reduced its budget from its original million to a current level of million  which includes only essential projects and profitable projects based upon current economic conditions 
the company is pursuing adding additional cogeneration facilities to fully develop its properties and replace its conventional steam generation sources 
as a generator of electricity  the company is directly affected by the well publicized california electrical crisis 
as of march   the company is owed a total of million for electricity sales to edison and pg e from november through february management anticipates that these amounts due will be paid in their entirety  however  the timing of the payments is uncertain at this time 
in addition  if the company is unable to collect a significant portion of these receivables  the write off of such portion may have an adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states
