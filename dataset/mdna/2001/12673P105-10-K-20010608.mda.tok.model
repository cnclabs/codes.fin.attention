item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to the company that are based on the beliefs and assumptions made by the company s management as well as information currently available to management 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the company does not intend to update these forward looking statements 
the company distributes and markets its software solutions directly to the end user as well as to distribution partners  resellers or vars 
the company derives revenues from the following sources license fees the licensing of the company s solutions on a right to use basis  maintenance fees the providing of post contract customer support  and service fees the providing of professional services such as consulting and education services 
the timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period is determined by the nature of the contractual provisions included in the arrangements with customers 
prior to december  the company s software license arrangements included contractual provisions that resulted in the recognition of license fee revenue attributable to the software products upon delivery of the software products  provided that the arrangement fee was fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee was probable hereinafter referred to as traditional license revenue 
beginning in december  the company s software license arrangements included contractual provisions that  among other things  allowed the customer to receive unspecified future software products within designated product lines 
under these arrangements  the company recognizes revenue attributable to the software products ratably over the term of the license arrangement commencing upon delivery of the currently available software products  provided that the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
as was the case prior to december  maintenance and professional service fees are generally recognized as the services are performed 
fiscal year total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or billion  over fiscal year excluding an approximate million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  revenue decreased billion to billion 
total revenue was unfavorably impacted in the second half of the fiscal year due to the introduction of the new business model whereby license fee revenue for such arrangements is now recognized over the contract term 
additionally  the company experienced weakness in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of clients deferring purchases ahead of an ibm hardware cycle 
in fiscal year  traditional license revenue decreased  or billion to billion  compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of the company s transition to the new business model during the third quarter of fiscal as well as a decrease in mainframe product revenue  partially offset by the addition of sterling and platinum products  acquired in march and may  respectively  and the increased demand for ebusiness solutions 
the new business model provides clients with flexible contractual terms and conditions resulting in the ratable recognition of product revenue from such contracts over the term of the contract 
prior to the new business model  traditional license revenue was generated from executed software license arrangements that included contractual provisions that resulted in the recognition of revenue attributable to the software products upon delivery of the software products  provided that the arrangement fee was fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee was probable 
the new business model will improve the visibility of the company s revenue streams and reduce the uncertainty of quarterly revenue since license fees will be recognized ratably  rather than on an up front one time basis 
to enhance comparability  the company has supplemented the md a with pro forma financial information for the current and prior year 
subscription based license and maintenance fee revenue was million and represents the revenue recognized on a ratable basis since the introduction of the new business model in the third quarter of fiscal the remainder of the license and maintenance fees payable on such license arrangements will amortize into revenue over the respective license arrangement s term 
in fiscal year  maintenance fee revenue increased  or million  to billion from the prior year primarily as a result of acquired companies products  partially offset by a decrease associated with revenue recorded since the introduction of the new business model 
maintenance will continue to decrease as deferred maintenance under the old business model is amortized over the contract term 
for the fiscal year ended march   financing fee revenue increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of an increase in installment based licenses and the associated non current receivables prior to the introduction of the new business model 
financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms and the subsequent increase to receivables to the amount due and payable by customers 
this accretion of financing revenue on the unpaid receivables due in future years represent financing fees 
in fiscal year  professional service revenue increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of the acquisition of sterling in march  partially offset by the company s refocusing of its service operations on engagements involving the company s products 
such refocusing has unfavorably impacted professional services revenue 
reflecting the strategy to focus the professional services organization on the deployment of ca solutions  the company divested sterling s federal systems group governmental consulting division in the third quarter of fiscal year sales in the united states represented of overall revenue for fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year consistent with the overall decrease in revenue  international revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal year or in the comparable period in fiscal year in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding the charge associated with the bankruptcy of inacom corporation of approximately million  increased from the prior year to billion  exclusive of the charges of approximately million in fiscal year associated with the write off of the company s investment in chs electronics  inc chs 
the increase was largely attributable to the company s higher fixed expense structure  principally the result of added personnel and related costs from the acquisition of sterling  as well as increased spending on marketing associated with a new comprehensive advertising campaign and an increase in provision expense for accounts receivable as a result of the difficult economic climate 
product development and enhancement expenses increased million  or  for fiscal year compared with the prior year 
there was continued emphasis on adapting and enhancing products for the distributed processing environment as well as the broadening of the company s ebusiness product offerings  and additional expenses related to development efforts of products obtained through the acquisition of sterling 
commissions and royalties increased million  or  over the prior year 
commissions and royalties as a percentage of revenue increased due to the lower revenue achievement associated with the company s transition to the new business model without an associated change in the sales compensation structure which rewards sales personnel on the total arrangement 
depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal year increased million over the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the additional amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles associated with sterling  marginally offset by the scheduled reductions in the amortization of costs associated with past acquisitions 
net interest expense increased million compared with the prior year 
the additional interest expense was related to the increase in average debt outstanding associated with borrowings incurred to fund the platinum acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year the pre tax loss of million for fiscal year represents a decrease of billion  over fiscal year excluding a special gain of million related to the settlement of the stock plan litigation and a special charge of million related to the bankruptcy filing of inacom corporation  the pre tax loss would have been million  compared with pre tax income of billion in fiscal year  excluding special charges of million and million for in process research and development ipr d relating to the acquisitions of platinum and sterling  respectively  and approximately million related to the write off of chs 
net loss for the year ended march  was million  a decrease of billion over fiscal year fiscal net loss  excluding the after tax aforementioned special items  was million  a decrease of billion over the prior year s net income  exclusive of the aforementioned special charges 
the company s consolidated effective tax rate  excluding acquisition amortization and ipr d charges  was for both fiscal years and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda totaled million for fiscal year  a decrease of  or billion  over fiscal year this ebitda total is derived by adding back interest  depreciation and amortization  and income taxes into the million year to date net loss prior to special items 
fiscal year and fiscal year pre tax and net loss income and ebitda are not comparable due to the implementation of the company s new business model in the third quarter of fiscal year see discussion of the pro forma results of operations below 
fiscal year total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased  or billion  over fiscal year excluding an approximate million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  revenue increased to billion 
in fiscal year  the increase of  or million  to billion from the prior year  in traditional license revenue was primarily attributable to growth in distributed platform product fees  the addition of platinum products and the demand for ebusiness solutions 
in fiscal year  maintenance fee revenue increased  or million  to million from the prior year  primarily as a result of the platinum acquisition as well as additional maintenance revenue from prior year license arrangements 
in fiscal year  financing fee revenue increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of the increase in installment based licenses and the associated increase in non current receivables over the prior year 
in fiscal year  professional services revenue increased  or million  to million from the prior year  as a result of acquisitions of several services companies  including platinum s services operations and cmsi  as well as internal growth 
professional services revenue for the year ended march  was unfavorably impacted by the company s use of consultants to supplement its technical resources during and after the changeover of the date to the year the consultants were positioned at large client sites  without charge to the client  to assist with any potential difficulties attributable to the date change 
such activities were conducted by the company during december and january the process of reducing low margin contracts associated with acquisitions during this period negatively impacted professional services revenue 
total revenue in the united states for the year ended march  grew over the prior year 
this resulted from continued growth in distributed platform product sales  mainframe solutions  the addition of platinum products  and professional services 
on a year to date basis  sales in the united states represented of revenue for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year on a year to date basis  international revenue increased by million  or  over the prior year 
the international growth was supported by the asia pacific operations  which contributed more than half of the increase in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal year or in the comparable period in fiscal year in fiscal year  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year  excluding the charges associated with the write off of the company s investment in chs of approximately million  decreased to from the prior year 
the decrease was largely attributable to efficiencies realized by eliminating redundant headcount and overhead expenses as a result of the platinum integration 
this was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs related to an overall increase in headcount resulting from the expansion of the company s professional services organization  as well as higher spending on marketing associated with a new television campaign which commenced in the quarter ended december  product development and enhancement expenses increased million  or  for the year compared with the prior year 
there was continued emphasis on adapting and enhancing products for the distributed processing environment  as well as the broadening of the company s ebusiness product offerings  and additional expenses related to development efforts of products obtained through the acquisition of platinum 
commissions and royalties as a percentage of revenue were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense in the year increased million 
the increase was primarily due to the additional amortization of purchased intangibles associated with past acquisitions 
net interest expense increased million for this year compared to the prior year 
the additional interest expense was related to the increase in average debt outstanding associated with borrowings incurred to fund the platinum acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year and other smaller acquisitions in the current and prior fiscal years 
the pre tax income of billion for fiscal year increased  or million  over fiscal year excluding special charges of and million for ipr d relating to the acquisitions of platinum and sterling  respectively  and approximately million relating to chs  pre tax income was billion  a increase over the prior year exclusive of any special charges 
net income for the year ended march  was million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal year year to date net income  excluding the after tax aforementioned special charges  was billion  an increase of million  or  over the prior year s net income  exclusive of the one time after tax charge of million associated with the vesting of million shares under the plan 
the company s consolidated year to date effective tax rate  excluding the ipr d and the plan charges  was for both fiscal years and the addition of non deductible intangible assets from the acquisition of platinum was offset by a shift in the mix of domestic and foreign income 
ebitda totaled billion for fiscal year  an increase of  or million  over fiscal year this ebitda total is derived by adding back interest  depreciation and amortization and income taxes into the billion year to date net income prior to special charges

pro forma results of operations to enhance comparability of financial results  the md a is supplemented with separate pro forma operating excluding acquisition amortization and special items financial information in order to give effect to the acquisitions of platinum and sterling as if they had occurred on april  and as if the company  platinum and sterling had been operating under the new business model since their inception 
while these results may not be indicative of operations had these acquisitions actually occurred on that date and had the company historically been operating under the new business model  they may provide a more meaningful basis for comparison 
the company prepared pro forma revenue for fiscal year and to provide a meaningful comparison for the year in which the new business model was implemented 
pro forma revenue was not completed for fiscal year since fiscal years and were comparable 
total pro forma revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was  million  an increase of  or million  over the prior year pro forma revenue of  million 
the increase was attributable to the ratable recognition of revenue on contracts transacted during the prior fiscal year  partially offset by a reduction in professional services revenue  which was primarily the result of the divestiture of sterling s federal systems group governmental consulting division in the third quarter of fiscal  and the company s decision to reduce professional services associated with non ca products 
sales in north america represented of pro forma revenue for fiscal year  compared with for fiscal year international pro forma revenue decreased by million  or  over the prior year 
the international pro forma revenue was unfavorably impacted by the effect of exchange rates on the us dollar versus foreign currencies and weaker european performance  partially offset by improved performance in asia 
on a pro forma basis  pre tax income excluding acquisition amortization and special items was billion for fiscal year  an increase of  or million  over prior year s pre tax income of billion exclusive of acquisition amortization and special charges 
pro forma net income  excluding acquisition amortization and special items  was million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or  over fiscal year the company s consolidated annual effective tax rate  excluding acquisition amortization  was assumed to be for both fiscal years and the pro forma revenue of  million was determined by taking the annual reported revenue of  million and eliminating the up front license revenue recognized in fiscal year of  million  offset by the current year amortization of such licenses revenue of million 
in addition  the pro forma results include the license fee amortization of  million  million and million related to the company  sterling and platinum  respectively  which represents license revenue recognized up front for direct product sales in prior fiscal years had the company been recognizing revenue on a ratable basis 
in process research and development in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired sterling in a stock for stock exchange valued at approximately billion 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company acquired platinum for approximately billion in cash and assumed liabilities 
acquired in process research and development ipr d charges relate to acquisitions of software companies accounted for under the purchase method  in which a portion of the purchase price is allocated to acquired in process technology and is expensed immediately since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects has not yet been achieved and is believed to have no alternative future use 
independent valuations of sterling and platinum were performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to ipr d  which was million and million for sterling and platinum  respectively 
assets were identified through on site interviews with management and a review of data provided by the company and discussions with the acquired companies management concerning the acquired assets  technologies in development  costs necessary to complete the ipr d  historical financial performance  estimates of future performance  market potential and the assumptions underlying these estimates 
the income approach was utilized for the valuation analysis of ipr d for both sterling and platinum 
this approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset  which was determined through review of data provided by both the acquired companies and independent sources and through analysis of relevant market sizes  growth factors  and expected trends in technology 
the steps followed in applying this approach included estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a rate of return commensurate with the relative risk levels 
the ongoing development projects at sterling at the time of the purchase were composed primarily of application development and information management  business intelligence  network management  and storage management tools and solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of cool  vision  eureka  sams and solve product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
the ongoing development projects at platinum at the time of the purchase were composed primarily of application development  database and enterprise management tools and data warehousing solutions 
the acquired projects included add on features  tools and next generation versions of db solutions  provision  security  advantage application development  end to end data warehousing  and internet infrastructure product families 
at the time of acquisition  it was estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and the remaining development effort would take approximately months to complete  with a cost of approximately million 
the resulting net cash flows from sterling and platinum projects were based on management s estimates of product revenues  cost of goods sold  operating expenses  r d costs  and income taxes from such projects 
the revenue projections used to value the ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the rate used in discounting the net cash flows from the ipr d approximated for both sterling and platinum 
these discount rates  higher than that of the company s cost of capital  are due to the uncertainties surrounding the successful development of ipr d 
the efforts required to develop the in process technology of the acquired companies into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of planning  designing  prototyping and testing functions that are necessary to establish that the software produced will meet its design specifications  including technical performance  features and functional requirements 
as of march   the company incurred development costs for the platinum and sterling related projects of approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of the projects were completed within months of the original projected completion dates with the remainder scheduled for completion in fiscal year the completed projects include the platinum db solutions  security and half of the provision projects  as well as several of sterling s cool  vision  eureka and solve projects 
to date  the company has not materially deviated from the total projected costs to complete the projects  and believes the remaining costs  combined with the costs already incurred  will be consistent with the original overall projections 
in order for the company to succeed in the highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace in which it operates  it has been the company s philosophy to continue to develop  as well as integrate  acquired projects into its solutions 
the company is committed to both the sterling and platinum product lines and continues to invest in the development  enhancement and integration of the acquired projects 
in addition  the company does not specifically track revenue generated from completed ipr d projects subsequent to the closing and integration of acquisitions 
if these projects do not continue to be successfully developed  supported and marketed  the revenue and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
results will also be subject to uncertain market events and risks that are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  government regulations  market size and growth and product introduction by competitors 
management believes that the assumptions used in the purchased ipr d valuation reasonably estimate the future benefits 
there can be no assurances that in future periods actual results will not deviate from current estimates 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at march   a decrease of million from the march  balance of  million 
during fiscal year  the company used cash on hand to repay over million in debt and repurchase approximately million in treasury stock 
cash generated from operations for fiscal year was  million  a decrease of million from the prior year s cash from operations of  million 
cash from operations was unfavorably impacted this current fiscal year due to higher costs associated with increased headcount and other expenses related to the sterling acquisition 
the company s bank credit facilities consist of a billion four year revolving credit facility  a billion four year term loan  and a million british pound sterling denominated day term loan 
during the year  the company repaid all outstanding amounts under both its billion day and four year revolving credit agreements 
as a reflection of its continued reduced need for bank borrowings  emphasis on debt reduction  and overall expected ability to generate cash from operations  the company did not renew its billion day revolving credit facility when it expired in may as of march   billion remained outstanding under the four year term loan and approximately us million was outstanding under the pound sterling term loan at various interest rates 
there are no drawings under the company s billion four year revolving credit facility 
the interest rates on such debt are determined based on a ratings grid  which applies a margin to the prevailing london interbank offered rate libor 
in addition  the company established a billion us commercial paper cp program in the first quarter of this year to refinance some of its debt at more attractive interest levels 
as of march   million was outstanding under the cp program 
the company also utilizes other financial markets in order to maintain its broad sources of liquidity 
in fiscal  billion of unsecured senior notes were issued in a transaction governed by rule a of the securities act of amounts borrowed  rates and maturities for each issue were million at due april   million at due april  and million at due april  as of march   million was outstanding under the company s senior notes 
these notes call for annual repayment of million each april until final maturity in unsecured and uncommitted multicurrency lines of credit are available to meet any short term working capital needs for subsidiaries operating outside the us these lines total us million  of which us million was drawn as of march  debt ratings for the company s senior unsecured notes and its bank credit facilities are bbb and baa from standard poor s and moody s investor services  respectively 
the company s commercial paper program is rated a from standard poor s and p from moody s 
peak borrowings under all debt facilities during fiscal year totaled approximately billion with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of march   the cumulative number of shares purchased under the company s various open market common stock repurchase programs  including almost million shares purchased in the current fiscal year  was million 
the remaining number of shares authorized for repurchase is approximately million 
capital resource requirements as of march  consisted of lease obligations for office space  computer equipment  mortgage or loan obligations and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions 
it is expected that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  the availability of borrowings under credit lines and cash provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
the company expects its long standing history of providing extended payment terms to customers to continue under the new business model and thus does not expect a change to its future cash flow  since customers are expected to continue to finance their purchases over the contract period 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and  as amended  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires balance sheet recognition of derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in the values of derivatives is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the adoption of sfas could increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income in the future 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period 
as of april   the company has adopted sfas and has not identified any derivative instruments subject to the provisions of sfas the company does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risk factors current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below 
any of these factors  or others  many of which are beyond the company s control  could negatively affect the company s revenue  profitability or cash flow in the future 
the computer software business is highly competitive 
the market in which the company competes is marked by rapid and substantial technological change  the steady emergence of new companies and products  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
to remain competitive  the company must develop new products and continue to enhance existing products 
the company may be unsuccessful in its ability to develop new releases or new products that meet the needs of its customers in light of competitive alternatives available in the market 
in addition  the introduction of new products or versions of existing products may not meet with customer acceptance or may be delayed 
the company s inability to bring new products and enhancements to existing products to the market in a timely manner or the failure for these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
the software business is marked by easy entry and large entrenched businesses 
many companies with whom the company competes  including ibm  sun  hp  compaq and other large computer manufacturers  have substantial resources  a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche  as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by the company 
competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry 
some  like microsoft  oracle corporation and sap ag  are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets 
in addition  new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis  offering products that compete with those offered by the company 
increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry 
additionally  many customers historically have developed their own solutions that compete with those offered by the company 
competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions  or displacement of the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments 
ibm  hp  sun  compaq and microsoft are by far the largest suppliers of systems software and  in most cases  are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of the company s clients 
historically  these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems  systems software and computer hardware 
such new products could in the future incorporate features which perform functions currently performed by the company s products or could require substantial modification of the company s products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software 
although the company has to date been able to adapt its products and its business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
failure to adapt the company s products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of the company s products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems 
in the past  licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code  which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers  object code  which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation 
since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software  which must interface with the operating systems  independent software vendors such as the company were able to develop and market compatible software 
ibm and other hardware vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems 
to date  this policy has not had a material effect on the company 
such companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
such restrictions may  in the future  result in higher research and development costs for the company in connection with the enhancement and modification of the company s existing products and the development of new products 
although the company does not expect that such restrictions will have this effect on its products  there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
third party microcode could impact product development 
the company anticipates ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers 
microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are therefore less flexible than pure software 
the company believes that such continued use will not have a significant impact on the company s operations and that its products will remain compatible with any changes to such code 
however  there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions 
the company s products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of its customers information processing resources 
in a recessionary environment  the company s products are often a reasonable economic alternative for customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general or regional slowdown in the world economy could cause customers to delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and operating results 
fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses 
most of the revenue and expenses of the company s foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company s future operating results 
given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of the company s products  foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions 
additionally  deterioration of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar can affect the company s ability to increase its revenue within those markets  all of which may adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the markets for some or all the company s key product areas may not continue to grow 
the company has identified six product focus areas enterprise management  ebusiness security  ebusiness storage  ebusiness transformation and integration  portal and knowledge management  and predictive analysis and visualization 
some or all of these areas may not continue to grow  may not grow at their current rates  may decline in growth or customers may decline or forego use of products in some or all of these focal areas 
this is particularly true in newly emerging areas  like portal and knowledge management and predictive analysis and visualization 
a decline in these focus areas could result in decreased demand for the company s products  which would adversely impact its business  financial condition and operating results 
fiscal will be the first full fiscal year operating under the company s new business model 
the company s new business model affords customers greater flexibility in licensing transactions 
for example  the company under the new business model will license software on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try the company s software solutions without committing to a multi year license obligation 
transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not implement the company s software and will not enter into a long term relationship with the company 
this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
this effect could be diminished as customers elect cost certainty by committing to longer contract periods 
operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors 
quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors  including those listed below  which in turn could negatively affect the company s revenue  profitability or cash flow in the future 
these factors include demand for products and services  length of sales cycle  customer implementation of the company s products  magnitude of price and product competition  introduction of new hardware  general economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business  customer budgets for hardware and software  ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ability to control costs  the size of licensing transactions  ability to retain qualified personnel  and reaction of customers to the new business model 
any of the foregoing factors may cause the company s operating expenses to be disproportionately high or cause its revenue and operating results to fluctuate 
as a consequence  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken the company s competitive position 
future success of the company is dependent upon its proprietary technology 
the company protects its proprietary information through the use of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
notwithstanding the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  policing unauthorized use or copying of its proprietary information is difficult  unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time  and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources 
moreover  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to the company s proprietary rights as do the laws of the united states 
for example  shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which the company operates 
in addition  patents the company have obtained may be circumvented  challenged  invalidated or designed around by other companies 
the company s inability to adequately protect its intellectual property for these or other reasons could affect its business  financial condition and operating results 
third parties could claim that the company s products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
from time to time the company receives notices from third parties claiming infringement on various forms of their intellectual property 
investigation of these claims  whether with or without merit  can be expensive and could affect development  marketing or shipment of the company s products 
as the number of software patents issued increases  it is likely that additional claims  with or without merit  will be asserted 
defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the success of the company s international operations is subject to many factors 
international sales represented approximately of the company s total worldwide revenue for the year ended march  continued success in selling the company s products outside of the united states depends on a variety of factors  including the following reorganizations of the sales force  fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  staffing key managerial positions  general economic conditions in foreign countries  political instability  and trade restrictions such as tariffs  duties or other controls affecting foreign operations 
increase in tariffs  the imposition of trade restrictions or other factors may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
certain software is licensed from third parties 
some of the company s products contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to the company in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow its products to remain competitive 
the loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products 
this could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
changes to compensation of the company s sales organization 
with the introduction of the new business model  the company revised its compensation plan for the sales organization effective april  the new compensation plan is in alignment with the new business model objectives of providing client flexibility and satisfaction 
the compensation plan may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company remains dependent upon large transactions 
notwithstanding changes resulting from implementation of the new business model  the company remains dependent to some degree upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers 
historically  the size and magnitude of such transactions have increased over time 
while the company anticipates that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future  as more customers take advantage of the licensing flexibility afforded under the new business model  a certain number of these transactions are likely to occur 
as customers continue to transition to the new business model  the incidence of large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers could affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
a large portion of business is consummated at the end of each quarter 
historically  a significant percentage of the company s quarterly transactions are finalized in the last few days of the quarter  which may impact financial performance 
one of the intended benefits the company anticipates from introduction of the new business model will be a more predictable revenue stream throughout the quarter 
as customers continue to transition to the new business model  there are likely to be a large number of transactions that will be consummated in the last few days of the quarter  with the risk that some of these may not become final 
failure to finalize transactions in the last few days of the quarter could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
growth depends upon successful integration of acquisitions 
the company s growth strategy is based upon internal development of technology  selective acquisitions and integration of such acquisitions into ongoing operations 
implementation of this growth strategy may result in strains on the company s management team  internal systems and financial resources 
difficulties encountered in successfully integrating acquired companies and products may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results

foreign currency exchange risk the company conducts business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in countries
