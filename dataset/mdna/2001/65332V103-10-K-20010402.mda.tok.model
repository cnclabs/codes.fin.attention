item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a 
overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations 
historical results may not indicate future performance 
see part i  item business l 
risk factors our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nextel international and its consolidated subsidiaries 
however  additional more detailed and focused information relating to nextel international may be found in the periodic and other reports filed by nextel international with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to the rules under the securities exchange act of 
table of contents operating revenues primarily consist of service revenues and revenues generated from the sales of digital handsets and accessories 
service revenues primarily include monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio service  charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes and long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers 
see item selected financial data for a description of a change in our revenue recognition method related to digital handsets 
cost of revenues primarily includes the cost of providing wireless service and the cost of digital handset and accessory sales 
cost of providing wireless service consists primarily of costs of interconnection with local exchange carrier facilities and direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  such as property taxes  insurance costs  utility costs and rent for the network switches and sites used to operate our digital mobile networks 
interconnection costs have fixed and variable components 
the fixed component of interconnection costs consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers 
the variable component of interconnection costs  which fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of wireless calls  generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for wireless calls terminating on their networks 
cost of digital handset and accessory sales consists primarily of the cost of the digital handset and accessories  order fulfillment and installation related expenses and write downs of digital handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence 
we sell digital handsets and accessories at prices below our cost as an incentive for new customers to subscribe to our services and as a retention inducement for existing customers 
our operating revenues and the variable component of the cost of digital handset and accessory sales are driven primarily by the number of digital handsets sold or in service and not necessarily by the number of customers  as one customer may purchase one or many digital handsets

as a result of the adoption of sab no 
 we changed our revenue recognition method for digital handset sales effective january  the adoption of sab no 
resulted in a million reduction to revenues from digital handset and accessory sales in had we adopted sab no 
effective january   revenues from domestic digital handset and accessory sales in would have increased by million or 
we continue to sell digital handsets at prices below our cost to attract new customers and as a retention inducement for existing customers 
additionally  as competition has intensified  the prices at which we sell digital handsets to our new and existing customers have declined 
accordingly  revenues from domestic digital handset and 
table of contents accessory sales have not increased in proportion to the increase in number of digital handsets sold 
we expect this trend to continue during the early part of however  for the remainder of  this effect may be mitigated as we introduce more feature rich and higher priced handsets  which may allow us to limit the level of subsidy required to attract and retain customers in our targeted segments 
domestic service revenues increased in principally as a result of a increase in domestic digital handsets in service 
average monthly revenue per domestic digital handset grew slightly from about during to about during total system minutes of use grew in  principally due to the larger number of handsets in service during as compared to additionally  average monthly minutes of use per subscriber increased in to about minutes  which we attribute to increased phone usage primarily driven by the introduction of pricing plans designed to provide additional value to our customers 
these new pricing plans  developed in part to meet competitive demands  generally provide lower per minute rates made available in conjunction with fixed rate service plans 
these plans typically include a fixed amount of interconnect minutes combined with unlimited digital two way radio service  unlimited nextel wireless web services  free incoming calls or free long distance service  all for a stated package price 
the growth in digital handsets in service is the result of a number of factors  principally declining digital handset prices  reflecting both reductions in our costs of acquiring handsets and increases in our subsidization of the resale prices of our handsets  including through two for one promotions  the introduction of more competitive service pricing plans targeted at meeting more of our customers needs  including a variety of fixed rate plans offering bundled monthly minutes and other integrated services and features  expanded network coverage and capacity  differentiated products and services  including nextel direct connect  the increased number of indirect distributors  increased advertising and marketing campaigns  and increased sales force and marketing staff 
our average monthly revenue per digital handset may decrease in the future if our customers migrate to lower priced service offering packages or if competitive pressures require us to further restructure our digital service offering packages to offer more value  reduce our digital service offering prices  or respond to particular short term  market specific situations  such as special introductory pricing or packages that may be offered by providers launching their service  or particular new product or service offerings  in a particular market 
operating revenues for our international operations increased in primarily as a result of a increase in the number of digital handsets in service in nextel international s latin american markets 
the implementation of calling party pay programs and the launch of new services  such as international roaming and digital mobile telephone service  in some latin american markets in also contributed to the increase 
had we adopted sab no

cost of digital handset and accessory sales increased due to the increase in the number of digital handsets sold to new and existing customers  offset  in part  by a decrease in the average cost we paid for the digital handsets sold and by the deferral of million of digital handset costs attributable to the adoption of sab no 
in had sab no 
been implemented effective january   the domestic cost of digital handset and accessory sales would have increased by million or 
domestic cost of service revenues increased in primarily as a result of variable costs related to interconnect fees on higher minutes of use and increased site ground lease and utility costs that we incurred

the increase in the cost of providing international wireless service is primarily attributable to an increase in variable costs related to interconnect fees on higher minutes of use  and an increase in site ground lease and utility expenses incurred due to an increase of about in the number of transmitter and receiver sites placed in service in nextel international s markets during the increase in international cost of digital handset and accessory sales in is primarily due to the increase in the number of digital handsets sold partially offset by the deferral of million of digital handset costs attributable to the adoption of sab no 
in we expect the amount of cost of revenues to increase as we place more switches and sites into service  as customer usage of the digital mobile network increases and as we sell more digital handsets and accessories to new customers and provide retention inducements to existing customers

increase of of decrease from consolidated consolidated previous year december  operating december  operating revenues revenues dollars percent dollars in millions selling  general and administrative domestic international selling and marketing domestic international intercompany eliminations nm general and administrative nm not meaningful the increase in domestic selling and marketing expenses in primarily reflects increased costs incurred in connection with higher consolidated sales of digital handsets including million  or a increase in commissions and residuals earned by indirect dealers and distributors as a result of increased digital handset sales through  and increased reliance on  indirect dealers and distributors in  million  or a increase in sales and marketing payroll and related expenses including increased commissions for our direct sales force  million  or a increase in advertising expenses  due to aggressive marketing campaigns directed at growing our customer base  and a million increase in other general marketing expenses 
the increase in international selling and marketing expenses in is primarily attributable to increased direct sales labor costs attributable to a larger direct sales force  increased commissions attributable to higher levels of digital handset sales and increased advertising costs throughout all latin american markets 
domestic general and administrative expenses increased in primarily as a result of activities to support a larger customer base  specifically million  or a increase in expenses related to billing  collection  customer retention and customer care activities  including the costs associated with our fourth customer care center which became fully operational in  million  or a increase in personnel  facilities and general corporate expenses primarily reflecting increased staffing for information technology and other administrative activities  and million  or a increase in bad debt expense 
international general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to a million increase in general corporate expenses including payroll and related expenses for collection and customer care activities to support a growing customer base  and facilities and information technology related costs to support the growth of operations 
this increase was offset by a million reduction in bad debt expense due to nextel international s increased focus on credit and collection activities 

table of contents the aggregate amount of selling  general and administrative expenses is expected to increase both domestically and internationally as a result of a number of factors  including but not limited to increasing commission and residual payments owed to indirect dealers and distributors as we sell more digital handsets through these channels  increasing costs as a result of opening and operating additional customer care centers  increasing sales  marketing and administrative support staffing  including costs associated with employee turnover  increasing costs associated with the implementation of our new billing system for domestic operations  continuing aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns in response to increasing competition for wireless subscribers  and increasing costs associated with customer retention activities

based on the current stage of development of each of our reportable segments  most of our operating revenues and identifiable assets  and all of our segment earnings  pertain to our domestic operations 
in  domestic segment earnings improved significantly and increased as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues 
this improvement is primarily due to a increase in domestic operating revenues  which has exceeded the increase in domestic operating expenses 
in  our increasing customer base generated higher operating revenues resulting in lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues due to the economies of scale achieved as a result of increases in system usage 
international segment losses improved slightly in  primarily due to the decrease in bad debt expense and increasing revenues from growth in digital handset sales 
we expect international segment losses to continue while we are building out our digital mobile networks and expanding our presence in international markets

during  we changed the estimated useful lives of some of our digital mobile network and non network assets 
these changes in estimates resulted in additional depreciation expense of million during we will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our assets in light of technology advances and the development of new services 
we expect the amount of depreciation to continue to increase as we place additional transmitter and receiver sites and switches into service 
amortization decreased million in as some of our domestic intangible assets were fully amortized in this decrease was offset by a million increase in amortization attributable to international acquisition activities during we expect the amount of amortization to increase as we acquire  place into service and continue to amortize intangible assets  such as licenses and customer lists

this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior notes outstanding during the increase in interest income in is primarily due to income recognized on the investment of the net proceeds we received in november from the public offering of our class a common stock and the issuance of our senior serial redeemable notes due  the net proceeds we received in january and by nextel international in august from the issuance of senior notes  and the additional borrowings under our domestic bank credit facility in the first half of and the related investment of these borrowed amounts pending our use of them 
the realized gain on exchange of investment resulted from the exchange of our stock in clearnet for stock in telus as a result of the acquisition of clearnet by telus in october the increase in in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates is due primarily to increased losses attributable to our equity method investment in nextel partners  inc the foreign currency transaction loss in is due primarily to the weakening of the brazilian real and philippine peso relative to the us dollar during the fourth quarter of  which has continued in early with respect to the brazilian real 
the foreign currency transaction loss is primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar during the early part of

domestic service revenues increased in principally as a result of a increase in domestic digital handsets in service 
we experienced a increase in system minutes of use in  along with an increase in the average monthly revenue per digital handset from about during to about during these factors contributed to domestic wireless service revenues growing at a faster pace than digital handset growth during we continued selling digital handsets at prices below our cost to attract customers 
as competition has intensified  our digital handset prices have declined 
accordingly  revenues from domestic digital handset and accessory sales have not increased in proportion to the increase in number of digital handsets sold 
the growth in digital handsets in service was the result of a number of factors  principally expanded network coverage and capacity  differentiated products and services including nextel direct connect  the increased number of indirect distribution channels  increased consumer awareness and acceptance of wireless communications  pricing plans targeted at particular market segments  and increased sales force and marketing staff 
international operating revenues increased in primarily as a result of a increase in digital handsets in service for international consolidated entities  offset by the effect of the brazilian real devaluation in the increase in digital handsets in service reflected the launch of digital wireless communications services in major markets in brazil  argentina and mexico in the second half of and peru in the second quarter of

domestic cost of service revenues increased in primarily as a result of a increase in the number of switches and a increase in transmitter and receiver sites and related equipment we placed in service during  as well as increases in airtime usage 
increased airtime usage resulted primarily from increased digital handsets in service and increased average system minutes of use per customer 
cost of digital handset and accessory sales increased in due to the increase in the number of digital handsets sold  offset  in part  by a decrease in the average cost we paid for the digital handsets sold 
the increase in the international cost of revenues in was attributable primarily to the increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites and switches placed in service during  as well as increases in international expenses associated with increased airtime usage resulting from additional digital handsets sold and in service

the increase in interest income in is primarily due to income recognized on the investment of the net proceeds received in november from the public offering of our class a common stock and the issuance of our senior serial redeemable notes due the increase in equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates in is primarily due to our equity method investment in nextel partners and increased losses in our philippine and japanese affiliates 
the increase in the foreign currency transaction losses is due primarily to the devaluation of the brazilian real relative to the us dollar during a million gain was recognized in on the sale of our ownership interest in a joint venture 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of about  compared to million in  reflecting an effective tax rate of about 
the change in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a change in the tax law in which extended the net operating loss carryforward period from to years for losses generated in or after therefore  in  more income tax benefit was recorded reflecting the increase in the net operating loss carryforward period 
in certain circumstances  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  limits the recognition of income tax benefits for net operating losses to the amount of deferred tax liabilities that are expected to reverse within the statutory carryforward period 
we increased the valuation allowance related to net operating losses by million in and million in since a significant portion of our deferred tax liabilities will reverse after existing net operating losses expire

cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities of million during improved by million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during this improvement in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to domestic operations and reflects increasing operating revenues and improved domestic financial performance resulting from the growth in our customer base 
capital expenditures to fund the continued expansion and enhancement of our digital mobile network continue to represent the largest use of our funds for investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities of billion during increased billion as compared to billion in primarily due to the billion increase in cash paid for capital expenditures and billion increase in cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of licenses 
cash payments for capital expenditures totaled billion during and billion during  including million during and million during for international operations 
cash paid for capital expenditures in increased by as compared to this increase was primarily driven by a increase in the number of switches placed in service and a increase in the number of transmitter and receiver sites and related equipment placed in service 
the increase in our customer base has placed increasing demands on our digital mobile network

risk factors 
table of contents our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
during the first quarter of  our domestic operations have begun to feel the impact of a slowing economy  resulting in reduced sales to our business customers  and we are incurring higher operating costs in our business 
as a result  we expect decreased operating cash flow from our domestic business in the first quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of to offset these factors  we are taking various actions to reduce costs and increase profitability 
however  we cannot be sure that our actions will be successful in controlling costs to the degree required to achieve our desired level of operating cash flow in as of december   our domestic bank credit facility provided for total secured financing capacity of up to billion  subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable borrowing conditions 
this facility consists of a billion revolving loan and billion in term loans that mature over a period from december  to december   as well as a billion term loan borrowed in march  maturing march  at december   we had borrowed the entire billion of term loans available under our bank credit facility 
amounts outstanding under this bank credit facility are secured by liens on assets of substantially all our domestic subsidiaries and bear interest payable quarterly at an adjustable rate calculated based either on the us prime rate or the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the maturity dates of the loans can accelerate if our credit ratings are below specified levels and if the aggregate amount of specified debt obligations that mature before june   including the redemption price of redeemable stock that is mandatorily redeemable before june   exceed specified amounts 
the availability of financing under this bank credit facility is subject to requirements under the indentures governing our public notes and the terms applicable to some of our preferred stock 
as of december   under our bank credit agreement  as then in effect  we were able to access the entire billion available in compliance with our financial ratio tests  the debt incurrence covenants contained in our indentures and the relevant terms of applicable issues of preferred stock 
currently  we expect to maintain a level of domestic capital expenditures during comparable to our domestic capital expenditures for our capital spending is expected to be driven by several factors  including the contemplated expansion and enhancement of digital mobile network coverage around most major domestic market areas  the contemplated construction of additional transmitter and receiver sites to increase system capacity and maintain system quality and the installation of related switching equipment in the existing domestic core market coverage areas  and the potential enhancement of our digital mobile network employing contemplated third generation or g technology 
in march  due to market conditions  nextel international announced its decision to discontinue its initial public offering at that time and withdrew its registration statement 
as a result  nextel international is currently in the process of reviewing its business plans 
nextel international will require a significant amount of capital to fund its operations and any planned network build out for at least the next several years 
we provided nextel international with significant financial support during in addition  we have committed to provide nextel international with an aggregate of million in additional funding  comprised of million of additional equity in the form of an investment in additional shares of its series a exchangeable redeemable preferred stock and a million loan secured by certain of their assets 
nextel international is also reviewing various other potential sources of financing  including public or private debt or equity financing and sales of nonstrategic assets 
however  nextel international may not be able to obtain any such funds from those other sources on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents if nextel international is unable to raise additional funds or obtain funds from other sources on acceptable terms and in a timely manner  nextel international may be required to conserve its available cash for use in funding its existing business activities  by slowing enhancement and expansion of its digital mobile networks and minimizing or eliminating certain expenditures 
although we have no legal obligation to make any equity investments in  or otherwise advance funds to  nextel international  to the extent nextel international is unable to obtain necessary funding from other sources  we may supply nextel international with additional funds  including the commitments outlined above 
any funding that we elect to provide to nextel international will reduce the amount of funding available for our domestic operations 
based on available cash resources and the anticipated cash needs of our domestic and international operations for capital expenditures and acquisitions and the combined anticipated operating cash flow of our domestic and international wireless businesses  we believe that we will be able to fully fund both our domestic and international operations through calendar year see part i  item business l 
risk factors our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
in making this assessment  we have considered consolidated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand as of december  of billion  the availability of billion of incremental funding over the amounts outstanding as of december  under our domestic bank credit facility  the net proceeds of billion from the january private placement of our senior serial notes due  the anticipated level of domestic capital expenditures  domestic and international debt service requirements  and our participation in supplying a substantial portion of the funding expected to be required for nextel international s operations during if our or nextel international s business plans change  or if economic conditions in any of our combined markets generally or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry change materially from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated in  or if other presently unexpected circumstances are encountered that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of the domestic or international mobile wireless businesses conducted by us or nextel international  the anticipated cash needs of those businesses  and the conclusions as to the adequacy of the available sources  each also could change significantly 
finally  our conclusion that we will be able to fully fund both our domestic and international operations through does not take into account the impact of our participation in any auctions for the purchase of licenses other than those already concluded or any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities other than those currently being pursued by us or nextel international 
any acquisition or new business opportunity could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources  and could require us or nextel international to raise additional equity and debt funding to meet those needs 
the availability of borrowings under our domestic bank credit facility is subject to certain conditions and limitations  and we cannot be sure that those conditions will continue to be met 
the instruments relating to our financing arrangements and preferred stock contain provisions that operate to limit the amount of borrowings that we may incur 
the terms of the domestic bank credit facility and nextel international s financing agreements also require us and our subsidiaries at specified times to maintain compliance with specified operating and financial covenants or ratios  including specified covenants and ratios related to leverage  which become more stringent over time 
in march  we amended our billion domestic bank credit facility to modify certain financial covenants to better reflect our anticipated financial performance and to permit ongoing compliance with the financial covenants during 
table of contents as of december   billion was outstanding under this facility leaving billion of additional availability  and we were in full compliance with all financial covenants under this facility as in effect on that date 
in addition  our capital needs  and our ability to adequately address those needs through debt or equity funding sources  are subject to a variety of factors that we cannot presently predict with certainty  for example the commercial success of our domestic and international digital mobile networks  the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and operating income or losses  the volatility and demand of the equity and debt markets  and the market price of our common stock 
we have had and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential equity investments and debt financing arrangements to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing equity or debt financing arrangements that have been consummated or are described in this annual report  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of equity or debt financing 
under the terms of the agreements between us and motorola pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of motorola s domestic mhz specialized mobile radio licenses in  we have agreed  under specified circumstances  not to grant superior governance rights to any third party investor without motorola s consent  which may make securing certain strategic equity investments more difficult 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness  including  in certain circumstances  indebtedness incurred under our domestic bank credit agreement  is and will be limited by the terms of our financing agreements and the terms of some series of our outstanding preferred stock 
e 
effect of inflation and foreign currency exchange inflation is not a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
from time to time  we may experience price changes in connection with the purchase of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  but we do not currently believe that any of these price changes will be material to our business 
the net assets of the subsidiaries of nextel international are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in local currency 
additionally  the long term debt of nextel international and its subsidiaries is almost entirely in us dollar denominated form  which also exposes such entities to foreign currency exchange risks 
certain subsidiaries conduct business in countries in which the rate of inflation is significantly higher than that of the united states 
nextel international will seek to protect its earnings from inflation and possible currency devaluation by trying to periodically adjust the local currency prices charged by the relevant subsidiary for sales of handsets and services to its customers 
however  nextel international may not be able to offset the devaluation of a foreign currency against the us dollar by a corresponding price increase 
while it routinely assesses its foreign currency exposure  nextel international has not entered into any hedging transactions 
f 
effect of new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standard no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended by sfas no 
 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
additionally  it requires that changes in the derivative instrument s 
table of contents fair value be recognized in our statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
effective january   we applied sfas no 
to all derivative instruments  and with respect to derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  we applied sfas no 
to all contracts issued  acquired or substantively modified after december  currently  we hedge the cash flows on some of our long term debt using interest rate swaps
