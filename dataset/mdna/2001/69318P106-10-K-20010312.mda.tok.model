the worldwide slowdown in the semiconductor industry began to impact the company s shipments during the second half of although the industry began to show signs of a recovery during the second half of  the company s sales orders did not return to early levels 
also  in  certain key customers of the company exited segments of the semiconductor business while others lost market share to their competitors

provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively

in  the japan operation was profitable 
incomplete technology update the acquired in process research and development ipr d which was expensed in in connection with the wells acquisition related to in process burn in socket designs and manufacturing process for various next generation high density ic package types 
more specifically  there were six projects for dual sided surface mount so packages  six for chip scale packages csp  three for land grid array lga  two for ball grid array bga  two for test sockets and one for a miscellaneous package 
as of december   none of the projects remain active 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in these funds were sufficient to meet working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which consist primarily of purchased tooling and equipment required to support the company s business 
the amount of these anticipated capital expenditures will frequently change based on future changes in business plans and conditions of the company and changes in economic conditions 
in december  the company obtained a senior credit facility for million from fleet national bank and other lenders the senior credit facility to finance in part the wells acquisition 
the senior credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company 
in conjunction with the senior credit facility  pcd and wells cti formerly wells electronics  inc each entered into a stock pledge agreement with fleet and the other lenders pledging all or substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries of pcd and wells cti 
each of pcd  wells cti and certain of their subsidiaries also entered into a security agreement and certain other collateral or conditional assignments of assets with fleet and other lenders 
in august  the company renegotiated the senior credit facility 
as a result  the interest rate premium of basis points charged on approximately million of the senior credit facility was eliminated 
according to its terms  the re negotiated senior credit facility will terminate on or before december  at december  and  borrowings of million and million were outstanding under the senior credit facility at weighted average interest rates of and  respectively 
the agreement governing the senior credit facility contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
among the operating covenants are restrictions that the company i must maintain john l 
dwight  jr 
as chief executive officer of the company or obtain the consent of the lenders under the senior credit facility to any replacement of mr 
dwight  ii may not  without the prior consent of such lender  acquire the assets of or ownership interest in  or merge with other companies  and iii may not  without the prior consent of such lenders  pay cash dividends 
the senior credit facility also requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants  including minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum quick ratio  maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda  maximum ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money to ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures  during the terms of the senior credit facility 
the company has experienced difficulty meeting all of the covenants under its senior credit facility 
accordingly  in september  certain covenants were amended by agreement between the company and its lenders 
in march  the company obtained from its lenders a waiver of compliance with certain covenants for the fourth quarter of at the same time  certain covenants were amended by agreement between the company and its lenders through june  in conjunction with the march agreement  the company issued warrants to its lenders covering a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were structured to become exercisable on june  if the company had not obtained at least million of subordinated debt or other capital infusions junior capital junior to loans under the senior credit facility by june   or by june  had not entered into definitive agreements permitting repayment of amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility by december  in addition  since the company did not obtain the junior capital by april   the company started on may  paying the lenders a quarterly fee of of the sum of the total outstanding principal balance under the term loan plus the revolving credit loan commitment 
during the second quarter of  the company s management and board of directors  in conjunction with its outside financial advisors  concluded that the cost of junior capital would have been prohibitively expensive under the existing market conditions 
accordingly  the company ceased efforts to raise junior capital 
the warrants for  shares of the company s stock became exercisable on june  and the lenders quarterly fee began on may at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain compliance with its debt covenants in the future  and failure to meet such covenants would result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 
to avoid an event of default  the company would attempt to obtain waivers from its lenders  restructure the senior credit facility or secure alternative financing 
under these scenarios  there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions would satisfactory to the company or not disadvantageous to the company s stockholders 
in december  the company entered into a subordinated debenture and warrant purchase agreement purchase agreement with emerson electric co 
emerson  the company s largest stockholder 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the company issued to emerson a subordinated debenture debenture with a principal amount of million at an annual rate of interest of and a common stock purchase warrant the emerson warrant for the purchase of up to  shares of pcd common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in april  the company paid the principal  interest and prepayment penalty of  or  in full  resulting in an extraordinary charge to income of  net of taxes  in the second quarter of accordingly   shares of the emerson warrant terminated by the terms thereof  leaving the emerson warrant only exercisable for  shares of pcd common stock 
the emerson warrant for  shares was exercised in the company believes its existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds generated from the company s operations  will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt payment requirements through because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company or not disadvantageous to the company s stockholders 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold used in plating  copper and brass used for contacts  and plastic material used in molding connector components 
in the past  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to similarly offset such cost increases in the future 
item a 
market risk interest rate risk pcd is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with its variable rate term loan 
in order to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on earnings  pcd entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a notional amount of its variable rate term loan 
under the swap agreement  pcd pays a variable rate under libor and receives a fixed rate of on a notional amount of  the potential increase in the fair value of its term loan when adjusting for the interest rate swap paying at a fixed rate resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates was not material
