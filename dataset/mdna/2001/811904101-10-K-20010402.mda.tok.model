it is not possible to predict whether any of these conditions or events might develop in the future 
the occurrence of any one or more of such conditions or events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
industry conditions exploration and drilling activities  which affect the demand for vessels  are influenced by a number of factors  including the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  the expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development  and the availability of drilling rigs 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond the company s control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries  and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves

customers the company offers offshore marine services to over customers including major integrated oil companies and large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the company has enjoyed long standing relationships with several of its customers and has established alliances with some of them 
the percentage of revenues attributable to any individual customer varies from time to time  depending on the level of oil and gas exploration undertaken by a particular customer  the suitability of the company s vessels for the customer s projects  and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of the company s offshore marine segment s operating revenues were earned from services provided to chevron corporation 
charter terms customers for vessels generally award charters based on suitability and availability of equipment  price and reputation for quality service  and duration of employment 
charter terms may vary from several days to several years 
competition the offshore marine service industry is highly competitive 
in addition to price  service  and reputation  the principal competitive factors for fleets include the existence of national flag preference  operating conditions and intended use all of which determine the suitability of vessel types  complexity of maintaining logistical support  and the cost of transferring equipment from one market to another 
although there are many suppliers of offshore marine services  management believes that only tidewater inc operates in all geographic markets and has a substantial percentage of the domestic and foreign offshore marine market in relation to that of the company and its other competitors

the company s operations are subject to significant federal  state  and local regulations  as well as international conventions 
the company s domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the united states coast guard the coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the us customs service  and the us maritime administration  as well as subject to rules of private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these agencies and organizations establish safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessels and accidents and to recommend improved maritime safety standards 
moreover  to ensure compliance with applicable safety regulations  the coast guard is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
the company is also subject to the shipping act   as amended the shipping act  and the merchant marine act of  as amended the act  and together with the shipping act  the acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the united states 
for a corporation engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a citizen of the us a the corporation must be organized under the laws of the united states or of a state  territory  or possession thereof  b each of the president or other chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a us citizen  c no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens  and d at least of the interest in such corporation must be owned by us citizens as defined in the acts 
should the company fail to comply with the us citizenship requirements of the acts  it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in the us coastwise trade during the period of such non compliance 
to facilitate compliance with the acts  the company s restated certificate of incorporation i contains provisions limiting the aggregate percentage ownership by non us citizens of any class of the company s capital stock including the common stock to of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such foreign ownership will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law presently  and authorizes the board of directors  under certain circumstances  to increase the foregoing percentage to  ii requires institution of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership  and iii permits the board of directors to make such determinations as reasonably may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations

foreign regulation 
the company  through its subsidiaries  joint ventures  and pooling arrangements  operates vessels registered in the following foreign jurisdictions st 
vincent and the grenadines  vanuatu  the cayman islands  france  chile  egypt  the netherlands  bahamas  greece  panama  liberia  the philippines  argentina  trinidad  tunisia  and mexico 
the company s vessels registered in these jurisdictions are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership  registration  manning  and safety of vessels 
in addition  the vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions to which the jurisdiction of registration of the vessels is a party 
among the more significant of these conventions are i the protocol relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships  ii the international convention on the safety of life at sea  and protocols  and iii the international convention on standards of training  certification  and watchkeeping for seafarers  the company believes that its vessels registered in these foreign jurisdictions are in compliance with all applicable material regulations and have all licenses necessary to conduct their business 
in addition  vessels operated as standby safety vessels in the north sea are subject to the requirements of the department of transport of the uk pursuant to the uk safety act 
environmental regulation 
the company s vessels routinely transport diesel fuel to offshore rigs and platforms and carry diesel fuel for their own use  transport certain bulk chemical materials used in drilling activities  transport rig generated wastes to shore for delivery to waste disposal contractors  and transport liquid mud which contains oil and oil by products 
these operations are subject to a variety of federal and analogous state statutes concerning matters of environmental protection 
statutes and regulations that govern the discharge of oil and other pollutants onto navigable waters include opa and the clean water act of  as amended the clean water act 
the clean water act imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of remediating releases of petroleum and other substances in reportable quantities 
state laws analogous to the clean water act also specifically address the accidental release of petroleum in reportable quantities 
opa  which amended the clean water act  increased the limits on liability for oil discharges at sea  although such limits do not apply in certain listed circumstances 
in addition  some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability under state law for oil spills occurring within their boundaries 
other environmental statutes and regulations governing the company s offshore marine operations include  among other things  the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  which regulates the generation  transportation  storage  and disposal of on shore hazardous and non hazardous wastes  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  which imposes strict and joint and several liability for the costs of remediating historical environmental contamination  and the outer continental shelf lands act  as amended ocsla  which regulates oil and gas exploration and production activities on the outer continental shelf 
ocsla provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas 
because the company s offshore marine operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  the government s exercise of ocsla authority to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to these federal and state laws  state and local laws and regulations and certain international treaties to which the us is a signatory  such as marpol  subject the company to various requirements governing waste disposal and water and air pollution 
environmental services market the company s environmental service business is operated primarily through nrc  irc  and erst and provides contractual oil spill response and other related training and consulting services 
the market for these services has grown substantially since when the united states congress passed opa after the exxon valdez spill in alaska 
opa requires that all tank vessels operating within the exclusive economic zone of the united states and all facilities and pipelines handling oil that could have a spill impacting the navigable waters of the united states  develop a plan to respond to a worst case oil spill and ensure by contract or other approved means the ability to respond to such a spill 
equipment and services oil spill response services 
the company owns and maintains specialized equipment that is positioned in designated areas to comply with regulations promulgated by the coast guard and also has personnel trained to respond to oil spills as required by customers and regulations 
the company provides these services on the east  gulf  and west coasts of the united states as well as in the caribbean 
from and until november   oil spill response services were provided on the west coast of the united states through a joint venture operation  clean pacific alliance cpa  between nrc and crowley marine services  inc crowley marine 
on november   nrc purchased crowley marine s interest in cpa and began a termination process 
as of that date  all of cpa s duty of performance under existing contracts was assigned and transferred to nrc 
cpa will be dissolved upon completion of the termination process 
when an oil spill occurs  the company mobilizes specialized oil spill response equipment  using either its own personnel or personnel under contract  to provide emergency response services for both land and marine oil spills 
the company has established a network of approximately independent oil spill response contractors that may assist it with the provisioning of equipment and personnel 
nrc has acted as the principal contractor on several of the largest oil spills that have occurred in the united states after the enactment of opa training  drill  and other professional services 
the company has developed customized training programs for industrial companies that educate personnel on the risks associated with the prevention of and response to oil spills  handling of hazardous materials  fire fighting  and other crisis related events 
the company also plans for and participates in customer oil spill response drill programs  vessel response plans  and response exercises 
the company s drill services and training programs are offered both on a stand alone basis and as part of its base retainer services 
international 
the company operates its environmental service business internationally through irc 
client services of irc include oil spill response  training  exercise support  and special projects in assessing risk of spills  response preparedness  strategies  and resource requirements 
international response services are currently provided in the southeast asia  indian ocean  caribbean  and latin america regions 
joint ventures have been formed with local partners in thailand  brazil  and venezuela to provide spill response and other services to multinational oil companies  governments  and industry 
oil spill response and related consulting service revenues derived from foreign operations have not been material 
customers and contract arrangements the company offers its retainer services and oil spill response services primarily to the domestic and international shipping community and to owners of facilities such as refineries  pipelines  exploration and production platforms  and tank terminals 
in addition to its retainer customers  the company also provides oil spill response services to others  including  under certain circumstances  the coast guard 
the company presently has approximately customers 
the company s retainer arrangements with these customers include both short term contracts one year or less and long term agreements  in some cases as long as ten years from inception 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately and of the company s environmental retainer revenue was received from citgo petroleum corporation and coastal refining and marketing  inc  respectively 
the company also generates revenue from the supervision of activities in response to oil spill emergencies 
the level of spill activity can dramatically impact the company s environmental service revenue 
a single large spill can contribute significantly to overall revenues and to operating income 
however  the company is unable to predict revenues from oil spills 
competition the principal competitive factors in the environmental service business are price  service  reputation  experience  and operating capabilities 
management believes that the lack of uniform regulatory development and enforcement on a federal and state level has created a lower barrier to entry in several market segments  which has increased the number of competitors 
the company s oil spill response business faces competition primarily from the marine spill response corporation  a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other industry cooperatives  and also from smaller contractors who target specific market niches 
the company s environmental consulting business faces competition from a number of relatively small privately held spill management companies 
government regulation nrc is classified by the coast guard as an oil spill removal organization osro 
the osro classification process is strictly voluntary and plan holders who utilize classified osros are exempt from the requirement to list their response resources in their plans 
the classification process represents standard guidelines by which the coast guard and plan holders can evaluate an osro s potential to respond to and recover oil spills of various types and sizes in different operating environments and geographic locations 
nrc holds osro classification under the current coast guard guidelines for every port in the continental united states  hawaii  and the caribbean 
in addition to the coast guard  the environmental protection agency epa  the office of pipeline safety  the minerals management service division of the department of interior  and individual states regulate vessels  facilities  and pipelines in accordance with the requirements of opa or under analogous state law 
there is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies 
when responding to third party oil spills  the company s environmental service business enjoys immunity from imposition of liability under federal law and some state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts  except for deaths  personal injuries  or if the company s environmental service business is found to be grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct 
the company s environmental service business maintains insurance coverage against such claims arising from its response operations 
it considers the limits of liability adequate  although there can be no assurance that such coverage will be sufficient to cover future claims that may arise 
investment in drilling services business chiles offshore llc  the predecessor to chiles offshore  was formed in august for the purpose of constructing  owning and operating ultra premium jackup drilling rigs 
in september  in conjunction with the chiles ipo  chiles offshore was converted into a corporation and renamed chiles offshore inc the company currently owns of chiles offshore s outstanding common stock  increased from immediately upon the chiles ipo  after a subsequent reduction in the number of shares of chiles offshore s outstanding common stock 
in  chiles offshore llc started construction of two ultra premium jackup drilling rigs at amfels  inc amfels  a shipyard located in brownsville  texas 
the first rig  the chiles columbus  was delivered in may  and the second rig  the chiles magellan  was delivered in october each a rig and together  the rigs 
in addition  since april  chiles offshore has been operating a third such rig  the tonala  under a bareboat charter with perforadora central sa de sa perforadora central  a mexican company 
as a result  chiles offshore currently operates three of the seven existing ultra premium jackup drilling rigs in the world  all of which presently operate in the us gulf of mexico 
in july  chiles offshore entered into an agreement with perforadora central to acquire  through a series of transactions  all of the shares of capital stock of a newly formed entity that will own the tonala in exchange for chiles offshore s common stock and its assumption of long term debt  the principal amount of which was approximately million as of december  chiles offshore expects the closing of the acquisition to take place during the second quarter of in april  chiles offshore entered into an agreement with keppel fels limited to construct an ultra premium jackup rig of the kfels mod v b design  the chiles discovery 
chiles offshore expects the chiles discovery to be delivered in singapore and placed in operation during the second quarter of at a construction cost of million  exclusive of interest and other capitalized costs 
in april  chiles offshore also entered into an agreement for the construction  at its option  of up to three additional rigs of the same design 
in september  chiles offshore completed the chiles ipo  and received approximately million of net proceeds 
as a result of the chiles ipo  the company s ownership in chiles offshore declined from to 
chiles offshore used approximately million of the chiles ipo proceeds to repurchase and retire approximately million principal amount of its senior notes plus accrued interest  constituting substantially all of its outstanding senior notes  and repaid approximately million of the amounts outstanding under its prior bank credit facility with accrued interest 
seacor owned approximately million aggregate principal amount of such notes and held an economic interest in substantially all of the remaining notes approximately million principal amount  and recognized a pretax gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
chiles offshore also used the chiles ipo proceeds to fund a portion of the costs required to further expand its rig fleet and for other general corporate purposes 
chiles offshore files reports with the securities and exchange commission the commission and its shares are traded on the american stock exchange  commonly referred to as amex  under the trading symbol cod 
demand for offshore drilling services is cyclical in nature and depends substantially on the condition of the oil and gas industry and its willingness to spend capital on exploration for  and production of  oil and natural gas 
the level of these capital expenditures is highly sensitive to existing oil and gas prices as well as price expectations among oil and gas operators 
increasing commodity prices generally result in increased oil and gas exploration and production  which translates into greater demand for offshore drilling services 
conversely  falling commodity prices generally result in reduced demand for those services 
in recent years  an increasing amount of exploration and production expenditures has been concentrated in deeper water requiring semisubmersible drilling rigs or drill ships 
the trend is expected to continue and could result in a decline in demand for jack up rigs 
in addition  the allocation of exploration and production expenditures to on shore prospects could affect demand for such rigs 
the financial results of the offshore drilling industry depend on the utilization levels and dayrates for rigs  which in turn are determined by the supply of available drilling rigs relative to demand 
periods of high demand  high utilization levels and high dayrates have been followed by periods of low demand  low utilization levels and low dayrates 
in the early s  in the aftermath of the second oil price shock  general expectations were that oil prices would rise substantially 
this was the basis for the dramatic new building activity that resulted in construction of offshore mobile rigs between and oversupply of rigs then caused worldwide offshore rig utilization to decline rapidly and substantially depressed the offshore contract drilling market until the beginning of the s 
by the mid s  the world s offshore drilling rig fleet had declined in size to the point at which low supply and high demand yielded higher utilization  and consequently higher dayrates 
chiles operations are subject to a variety of federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations which  among other things  limit discharge of certain materials into the environment and can require removal and cleanup operations 
for example  chiles could become liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills 
environmental protection has become increasingly stringent in recent years  and certain laws impose strict liability rendering a company liable for environmental damage without regard to fault 
such environmental laws and regulations may expose chiles to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for its acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
in addition  these laws and regulations can restrict access to certain areas  reducing potential sales of chiles services in the united states 
the primary federal environmental laws to which chiles is subject to include the i clean water act  ii opa  iii ocsla  iv clean air act  v rcra  and vi cercla

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations offshore marine services the company provides marine transportation  logistics  and related services largely dedicated to supporting offshore oil and gas exploration and production 
marine transportation services are provided through the operation  domestically and internationally  of offshore support vessels 
the company s vessels deliver cargo and personnel to offshore installations  tow and handle the anchors of drilling rigs and other marine equipment  support offshore construction and maintenance work  and provide standby safety support 
the company s vessels also are used for special projects  such as well stimulation  seismic data gathering  freight hauling  line handling  salvage  and oil spill emergencies 
logistics services include shorebase  marine transport  and other supply chain management services in support of offshore exploration and production operations 
operating revenues are affected primarily by the number of vessels owned and bareboat and time chartered in as well as rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet 
rates per day worked and utilization of the company s fleet are a function of demand for and availability of marine vessels  which is closely aligned with the level of exploration and development of offshore areas 
the level of exploration and development of offshore areas is affected by both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices which  in turn  are related to the demand for petroleum products and the current availability of oil and gas resources 
the table below sets forth rates per day worked and utilization data for the company s fleet during the periods indicated 
year ended december  rates per day worked supply and towing supply    anchor handling towing supply    crew    standby safety    utility and line handling    geophysical  freight  and other    overall fleet    overall utilization supply and towing supply anchor handling towing supply crew standby safety utility and line handling geophysical  freight  and other overall fleet rates per day worked is the ratio of total charter revenue to the total number of vessel days worked 
rates per day worked and overall utilization figures exclude owned vessels that are bareboat chartered out  vessels owned by corporations that participate in pooling arrangements with the company  joint venture vessels  and managed vessels and include vessels bareboat and time chartered in by the company 
revenues for certain of the company s vessels  primarily its standby safety vessels  are earned in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds sterling  and have been converted to us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the periods indicated 
opportunities to buy and sell vessels are actively monitored by the company to maximize overall fleet utility and flexibility 
since  fleet size has grown significantly from offshore support vessels at december  to offshore support vessels at december  this expansion has been achieved principally through the purchase of offshore support vessels from its competitors  newly constructed vessels  and equity holdings in joint ventures that own offshore support vessels 
the company has also sold many vessels from its fleet  particularly those that were less marketable serving the company s ordinary operations 
since  proceeds from the sale of certain vessels have been deposited into restricted cash accounts for purposes of acquiring newly constructed us flag vessels and qualifying for the company s temporary deferral of taxable gains realized from the sale of those vessels 
from time to time  the company bareboat or time charters in vessels 
a bareboat charter is a vessel lease under which the lessee charterer is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses  as well as the payment of bareboat charter hire to the providing entity 
a time charter is a lease under which the entity providing the vessel is responsible for all crewing  insurance  and other operating expenses and the charterer only pays a time charter hire fee to the providing entity 
operating revenues for vessels owned and bareboat or time chartered in are earned at similar rates 
however  operating expenses associated with vessels bareboat and time chartered in include charter hire expenses that  in turn  are included in vessel expenses  but exclude depreciation expense 
at various times  the company provides management services to other vessel owners 
charter revenues and vessel expenses of those managed vessels are not generally included in the company s operating results  but the company does recognize a management fee in operating revenue 
the company also bareboat charters out vessels 
operating revenues for these vessels are generally lower than for vessels owned and operated or bareboat chartered in by the company  because vessel expenses  normally recovered through charter revenue  are the burden of the charterer 
operating expenses include depreciation expense if vessels owned by the company are chartered out 
at december   there were vessels bareboat chartered out  including and vessels operated by the company s joint ventures and environmental service segment  respectively 
the table below sets forth the company s fleet structure at the dates indicated 
at december  fleet structure owned bareboat and time chartered in managed joint ventures and pools tmm joint venture smit joint venture pelican joint venture other joint ventures seavec pool avian fleet pool formally  saint fleet pool overall fleet see item business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
vessel operating expenses are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant vessel operating expense items are wages paid to marine personnel  maintenance and repairs  and marine insurance 
in addition to variable vessel operating expenses  the offshore marine business segment incurs fixed charges related to the depreciation of property and equipment 
depreciation is a significant operating expense  and the amount related to vessels is the most significant component 
a portion of the company s revenues and expenses  primarily related to the company s north sea operations  are received or paid in foreign currencies 
for financial statement reporting purposes  these amounts are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rates during the relevant period 
overall  the percentage of the company s offshore marine operating revenues derived from foreign operations  whether in us dollars or foreign currencies  approximated in the twelve month period ended december  regulatory drydockings  which are a substantial component of marine maintenance and repair costs  are expensed when incurred 
under applicable maritime regulations  vessels must be drydocked twice in a five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair 
the company follows an asset management strategy pursuant to which it defers required drydocking of selected marine vessels and voluntarily removes these marine vessels from operation during periods of weak market conditions and low rates per day worked 
should the company undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year or put through survey a disproportionate number of older vessels  which typically have higher drydocking costs  comparative results may be affected 
for the years ended december    and  drydocking costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
during those same periods  the company completed the drydocking of   and marine vessels  respectively 
as of december   the average age of vessels owned by the company was approximately years 
excluding the company s standby safety vessels  the average age of the company s fleet was approximately years 
the company believes that after offshore support vessels have been in service for approximately years years for crewboats and years for certain standby safety vessels  the level of expenditures which typically increase with vessel age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels or acquiring new or used vessels  or that the company s financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make capital expenditures for such purposes 
operating results are also affected by the company s participation in various joint ventures 
the company has formed or acquired interests in offshore marine joint ventures and entered into pooling arrangements with various third parties to enter new markets  enhance its marketing capabilities  and facilitate operations in certain foreign markets 
these arrangements allow the company to expand its fleet while diversifying the risks and reducing the capital outlays associated with independent fleet expansion 
the company also participates in a logistics joint venture whose mission has been to provide shorebase  marine transport  and other supply chain management services in support of offshore exploration and production operations principally in the us gulf of mexico 
see item business joint ventures and pooling arrangements 
the company actively monitors opportunities to buy and sell offshore support vessels that will maximize the overall utility and flexibility of its fleet 
in  the company acquired i standby safety vessels in the boston putford transaction  including vessels participating in joint ventures  ii a equity interest in a company that owned and bareboat chartered in crew vessel  iii towing supply vessels  and iv crew and anchor handling towing supply vessels that were newly constructed 
following year end  the company continued fleet expansion with the acquisition of the plaisance  rincon  and cheramie vessels  including under construction 
the cost of the plaisance marine and cheramie acquisitions will be allocated under the purchase method of accounting based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  plus amounts of transaction cost and the related deferred tax effect of the acquisition 
should the purchase transaction with stirling shipping be concluded  additional vessels will be added to the company s fleet 
in  the company sold vessels  including that were the subject of leaseback arrangements  and cancelled the bareboat charter in of vessels 
following year end  the company sold additional vessels 
the worldwide offshore rig count in increased sharply over following the recovery from the oil price collapse of and as drilling programs escalated to take advantage of much higher natural gas prices 
the number of offshore rigs in operation grew significantly in north america  west africa  the north sea  and the far east 
there were approximately offshore rigs in operation worldwide at year end  representing a increase over the count at the prior year end 
the number of offshore rigs drilling in us gulf of mexico deepwater  where water depths exceed  feet  were at a record high in  according to the mineral management service of the department of interior 
with higher commodity prices for oil and gas  many us gulf of mexico exploration and production companies have announced increased budgets for exploration and production projects and are expected to increase their capital expenditure programs for although day rates for offshore rigs in the north sea have recently improved  utilization has been steady at approximately 
rig utilization offshore west africa has risen steadily throughout  and utilization commitments for appear strong 
deepwater drilling activities offshore west africa have also been on the rise

a commitment remains to complete the construction of the remaining ship for an approximate cost of million  of which is expected to be financed from external sources 
the ship presently under construction is expected to enter service in in  the company and its dry bulk business partners sold and bareboat chartered back a built handymax dry bulk ship  the only dry bulk vessel operated since commencement of this business venture in the company may make selective acquisitions of offshore support vessels or barges  fleets of offshore support vessels or barges  oil spill response equipment  or expand the scope and nature of its environmental and logistics services  or invest in businesses related to its existing operations 
the company also may upgrade or enhance its offshore support vessels or construct offshore support vessels to remain competitive in the marketplace 
management anticipates that such expenditures would be funded through a combination of existing cash balances  cash flow provided by operations  sale of existing equipment and  potentially  through the issuance of additional indebtedness  shares of common stock  or the company s preferred stock 
credit facilities under the terms of the dnb credit facility that was established in november  the company may borrow up to million aggregate principal amount as such amount may be adjusted  the maximum committed amount under unsecured reducing revolving credit loans maturing on november  the maximum committed amount will automatically decrease semi annually by beginning november   with the balance payable at maturity 
outstanding borrowings will bear interest at annual rates ranging from to basis points the margin above libor 
the margin is determined quarterly and varies based upon the percentage the company s funded debt bears to ebitda  as defined  and or the credit rating maintained by moody s and standard poor s  if any 
the dnb credit facility requires the company  on a consolidated basis  to maintain a minimum ratio of vessels values to maximum committed amount  a minimum cash and cash equivalent level  a specified interest coverage ratio  specified debt to capitalization ratios  and a minimum net worth 
the dnb credit facility limits the amount of secured indebtedness that the company and its subsidiaries may incur  provides for a negative pledge with respect to certain activities of the company s vessel owning operating subsidiaries  and restricts the payment of dividends 
at december   there were outstanding letters of credit issued by den norske bank asa dnb on behalf of the company totaling million and the amount available for future borrowings under the dnb credit facility totaled million 
pursuant to a february letter agreement between the company and smit  the company agreed to prepay certain contingent obligations for additional purchase consideration that would otherwise have been payable to smit in pursuant to a certain asset purchase agreement dated december   by and among the company and smit 
the prepayment included cash of million and the issuance  effective january   of five year subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  which notes will bear interest at per annum payable quarterly in arrears 
the amounts prepaid to smit have increased the carrying values of vessels and certain joint venture interests that were acquired in the smit transaction 
at december   the company had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes due september  the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on march and september of each year commencing march  the notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of the company  in whole or from time to time in part  at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption plus a make whole premium  if any  relating to the then prevailing treasury yield and the remaining life of the notes

at december   the company had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of its convertible subordinated notes due november  the notes that were issued pursuant to a private placement and the smit transaction in the notes are convertible  in whole or part  at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the business day next preceding november   unless previously redeemed into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share equivalent to a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the notes are redeemable at the company s option at any time on or after november  at the redemption prices specified therein  together with accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date 
the notes are general unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated in right of payment to all senior indebtedness of the company and effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other obligations and liabilities and any preferred stock of the company s subsidiaries 
also  pursuant to the smit transaction  the company entered into certain lease purchase agreements which obligate the company to purchase two vessels from smit with cash and million principal amount of the notes in following december   the company called for redemption million of the million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes 
together with certain privately negotiated transactions  the call resulted in the redemption of million of the notes in exchange for  shares of common stock and million of the notes for approximately million 
on march   the company announced that it has called for redemption on april   million of the notes 
the redemption price would be  per  principal amount of notes plus accrued interest from november  to the redemption date 
holders of notes being called would be able to convert any or all of their notes into shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes until the close of business on april  seacor has entered into a standby agreement with credit suisse first boston credit suisse under which credit suisse has agreed  subject to certain conditions  to purchase from the company the shares of common stock that otherwise would have been delivered upon conversion of up to million aggregate principal amount of the notes that are subject to the call but are not converted 
the company would use those proceeds to redeem notes that are called for redemption but not converted 
capital structure at december   the company s capital structure was comprised of million in long term debt including current portion and million in stockholders equity 
long term debt declined million from the prior fiscal year end due primarily to the deconsolidation of chiles  chiles offshore s repayment of million borrowed under its bank facility  and the company s regularly scheduled repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
this decline in long term debt was partially offset by the issuance of fixed coupon notes in connection with the acquisition of boston putford 
stockholders equity rose due primarily to an increase in retained earnings of million from net income 
stockholders equity also rose million due to the issuance of common stock from treasury in connection with the acquisitions of scf and boston putford  million due to other comprehensive income that resulted primarily from unrealized gains on available for sale securities  and million due to the amortization of restricted stock 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline resulting from the company s repurchase of common stock 
on may   seacor s board of directors authorized a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on june  shareholders of record as of june  received one additional share of common stock for every two shares they owned on that date   shares were distributed 
stock and debt repurchase program in march  seacor s board of directors increased its previously announced securities repurchase authority by million 
the securities covered by this repurchase program the stock and debt repurchase program include common stock  the notes  the notes  and the chiles notes collectively  the seacor securities 
repurchases of seacor securities will be effected from time to time through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise  depending on market conditions 
in the twelve month period ended december   the company acquired  shares of common stock after adjustment for the stock split and million principal amount of the chiles notes for an aggregate cost of million 
at december   the company had approximately million of available authority for the repurchase of additional seacor securities 
due to the decline in the company s ownership interest of chiles offshore  resulting from the chiles ipo  the chiles notes will no longer be considered seacor securities and is no longer subject to the announced repurchase authority 
stock purchase and option plans on may   the stockholders of seacor approved the employee stock purchase plan the stock purchase plan that permits seacor to offer common stock for purchase by eligible employees at a price equal to of the lesser of i the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or ii the fair market value of the common stock on the last day of the offering period 
common stock will be available for purchase under the stock purchase plan for six month offering periods 
three hundred thousand shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the stock purchase plan during the ten years following its adoption 
eligible employees may accumulate savings through payroll deductions over an offering period in order to purchase common stock at the end of such period 
purchases of common stock under the stock purchase plan may only be made with accumulated savings from payroll deductions  and an employee cannot complete such purchases using other resources 
all employees who have been continuously employed by seacor s participating subsidiaries for at least six months and who regularly work more than hours a week and more than five months a year are eligible to participate in the stock purchase plan 
the stock purchase plan is intended to comply with section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  but is not intended to be subject to section a of the code or the employee retirement income security act of the board of directors of seacor may amend or terminate the stock purchase plan at any time  however  no increase in the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the stock purchase plan may be made without stockholder approval 
on may   the stockholders of seacor approved the stock option plan for non employee directors the non employee director plan 
under the non employee director plan  each member of the board of directors who is not an employee of seacor or any subsidiary will be granted an option to purchase  shares of common stock on the date of each annual meeting of the stockholders of seacor through and including the annual meeting of stockholders 
the exercise price of the options granted under the non employee director plan will be equal to of the fair market value per share of common stock on the date the options are granted 
one hundred fifty thousand shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the non employee director plan 
options granted under the non employee director plan will be exercisable at any time following the earlier of the first anniversary of  or the first annual meeting of seacor s stockholders after  the date of grant  for a period of up to ten years from date of grant 
subject to the accelerated vesting of options upon a non employee director s death or disability  if a non employee director s service as a director of seacor is terminated  his or her options will terminate with respect to the shares of common stock as to which such options are not then exercisable 
a non employee director s options that are vested but not exercised may  subject to certain exceptions  be exercised within three months after the date of termination of service as a director in the case of termination by reason of voluntary retirement  failure of seacor to nominate such director for re election or failure of such director to be re elected by stockholders after nomination by seacor  or within one year in the case of termination of service as a director by reason of death or disability 
goodwill the cost in excess of net assets of purchased businesses  goodwill  is being amortized on a straight line basis over to years 
as of december   unamortized goodwill  resulting from the acquisitions of nrc  erst  galaxie  and scf  totaled million and represents of the company s total assets 
various factors are considered in assigning the amortization period for goodwill  that include  among others  the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors that may reduce a useful life 
management periodically evaluates the amortization periods for goodwill to determine if later events or circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
it is also management s policy to review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
as of and subsequent to december   there have been no events or changes in circumstances surrounding the purchased businesses to indicate that the carrying value of the allocated goodwill may not be recoverable 
effects of inflation the company s significant international operations expose it to the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company may  from time to time  enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with major domestic or international financial institutions aimed at reducing the risk that the us denominated value of anticipated transactions in foreign currencies will be reduced or the cost of any such obligations increased as a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies valued against the dollar 
although the company does not consider inflation a significant business risk in the current and foreseeable future  in the event that inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy  inflationary pressures may result in increased operating and financing costs 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair market value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the adoption of sfas did not materially affect the financial statements of the company 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against its exposure to changes in foreign currencies and prices of natural gas and crude oil 
to protect certain of the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of the us dollar cash flows to be derived from net assets 
at december   there were no material unrealized gains or losses on the outstanding contracts 
during  the company also entered into norwegian kroner forward exchange contracts 
these contracts enable the company to buy norwegian kroners for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates that could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange rates should the company decide to conduct business in norway 
at december   the unrealized gains on the outstanding contracts totaled million 
the company has also entered into and settled various positions in natural gas and crude oil via swaps  options  and futures contracts 
the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline  which  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
at december   the company s positions in commodity contracts were not material 
forward looking statements certain statements discussed under the captions business  legal proceedings  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and elsewhere in this form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements concerning management s expectations  strategic objectives  business prospects  anticipated economic performance and financial condition  and other similar matters involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other important factors that could cause the actual results  performance or achievements of results to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements discussed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties  and other important factors include  among others the company s industry is subject to cyclicality  and a significant or prolonged decline in oil and gas prices would likely reduce the level of exploration and development of offshore areas  which would result in a lower demand for our offshore marine services and drilling rigs 
the company s industry is highly cyclical 
activity in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry has a significant impact on the company s offshore vessel operations and the operations of chiles 
factors that affect the level of exploration and development of offshore areas include both short term and long term trends in oil and gas prices 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile and  as a result  the level of offshore exploration and drilling activity also has been extremely volatile 
reductions in oil and gas prices generally result in decreased drilling and production and corresponding decreases in demand for the company s offshore vessel services and chiles drilling rigs 
decreased demand for these services and drilling rigs would reduce the company s revenue and profitability 
the company relies on several customers for a significant share of our revenues 
the loss of any of these customers could adversely affect our business and operating results 
customers are primarily the major oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies  members of the shipping community and owners of refineries  pipelines  and tank terminals 
the portion of the company s revenues attributable to any single customer changes over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by the customer  the company s ability to meet the customer s needs  and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
during  the company received approximately of its offshore marine service segment operating revenues from chevron corporation 
during  the company s oil spill response service segment received approximately of its environmental retainer revenue from coastal refining and marketing  inc and from citgo petroleum corporation  its two largest customers 
the company may incur significant costs  liabilities and penalties in complying with government regulations 
government regulation  such as international conventions  federal  state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where the company s vessels operate or are registered  have a significant impact on our offshore marine and environmental response businesses 
these regulations relate to worker health and safety  the manning  construction and operation of vessels  oil spills and other aspects of environmental protection 
risks of incurring substantial compliance costs and liabilities and penalties for non compliance  particularly with respect to environmental laws and regulations  are inherent in the company s business 
if this happens  it could have a substantial negative impact on the company s profitability and financial position 
the company cannot predict whether it will incur such costs or penalties in the future 
the company faces intense competition that could adversely affect its ability to increase its market share and its revenues 
the company s businesses operate in highly competitive industries 
high levels of competition could reduce its revenues  increase its expenses and reduce its profitability 
in addition to price  service and reputation  important competitive factors for offshore supply fleets include customers national flag preference  operating conditions and intended use all of which determine the suitability of available vessels  complexity of logistical support needs and presence of equipment in the appropriate geographical locations 
the important competitive factors in the environmental services business are price  service  reputation  experience and operating capabilities 
in addition  the company believes that the absence of uniform environmental regulation and enforcement on international  federal  state and local levels has lowered barriers to entry in several market segments and increased the number of competitors 
the company s oil spill response business faces competition from the marine spill response corporation a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other industry cooperatives  and smaller contractors who target specific market niches 
in the contract drilling business  customers generally award contracts on a competitive bid basis and contractors can move rigs from areas of low utilization and day rates to areas of greater activity and higher day rates 
the company believes that  as a result  competition for drilling contracts will continue to be intense for the foreseeable future 
decreases in drilling activity in a major market could depress day rates and could reduce utilization of the chiles rigs 
substantially all of chiles competitors in the business of providing jackup drilling services have substantially larger fleets and are more established as drilling contractors 
an increase in supply of offshore marine vessels would likely have a negative effect on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels  which would reduce the company s earnings 
expansion of the worldwide offshore marine fleet would increase competition in the markets where the company operates 
increased refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil support and related activities  or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity would lower charter rates and result in a corresponding reduction in our revenues and profitability 
marine related risks could lead to the disruption of the company s offshore marine services and to its incurrence of liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels is subject to various risks  including catastrophic marine disaster  adverse weather and sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  mechanical failure  collision  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  vessels  cargo  equipment under tow and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenue 
drilling related risks could lead to the disruption of chiles drilling services and to its incurrence of liability 
the operation of offshore jackup drilling rigs by chiles is subject to various risks  including blowouts  craterings  fires  collisions  groundings of drilling equipment and adverse weather and sea conditions 
these hazards could damage the environment  cause personal injury or loss of life and damage or destroy the property and equipment involved 
in addition  the chiles rigs face many of the marine related risks associated with the company s offshore support vessels 
if any of these events were to occur  chiles could incur substantial liability for oil spills  reservoir damage  and other accidents 
in addition  the affected chiles rigs could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenue 
insurance coverage may not protect the company from all of the liabilities that could arise from the risks inherent in its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its offshore marine and environmental response services 
there can be no assurance  however  that its existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 
the company s significant international operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
to minimize the financial impact of currency fluctuations and risks arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company attempts to contract the majority of its services in us dollars 
however  in some of its foreign businesses  the company collects revenues and pays expenses in local currency 
because the company conducts substantially all of its operations in us dollars  if the value of foreign currencies decline against the us dollar  the company s operating revenues in these foreign countries would effectively be reduced 
the company engages in certain currency hedging arrangements designed to minimize the effect of fluctuation in pounds sterling  the currency in the united kingdom  where most of its currency exchange risk arises 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
much of the company s offshore marine operations are conducted in foreign countries 
unstable political  military and economic conditions in those countries could adversely affect the company s business and operating results 
during  approximately of the company s offshore marine revenues were derived from foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  among other things  of political instability  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import export quotas  and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo in nigeria  for example  could have a significant negative impact on activity in the oil and gas industry in offshore west africa  a region in which the company operates vessels 
in addition  the company s offshore support vessel operations in mexico are significantly affected by mexican government policy 
the company cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future 
as our vessels become older  we may not be able to maintain or replace our vessels 
as of december   the average age of vessels the company owned  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore supply vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
spill response revenue is dependent upon the magnitude and number of spill responses 
the company s environmental service business spill response revenue can vary greatly between comparable fiscal periods based on the number and magnitude of spill responses in any given period 
as a result  the company s revenue and profitability attributable to this business may vary greatly from period to period 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for the company s environmental services 
the company s environmental service business is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa and  to a lesser extent  upon state regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for the company s environmental service segment s services 
the company cannot assure you that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for the company s oil spill response services could be reduced  which could have a negative impact on its profitability 
nrc relies on being classified as an oil spill removal organization 
a change in  or revocation of  this classification would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified as an osro 
osro classification is a voluntary process conducted by the united states coast guard 
the coast guard classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills in different operating environments  such as rivers canals  inland waters and oceans 
coast guard classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers 
customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the coast guard 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  the company could lose customers  in which case its revenues and profitability could be reduced 
the company s environmental service business may incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although the company s environmental service business is generally exempt from liability under the federal clean water act for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption would not apply if it found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it fails to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the clean water act 
in addition  the exemption under the federal clean water act would not protect the company s environmental service business against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which the company s environmental service business provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority determines that the company s environmental service business does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  the company s environmental service business could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
if the company does not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of its common stock  the company could be prohibited from operating its vessels in parts of the us  which would adversely affect its business and operating results 
the company is subject to the shipping act  and the merchant marine act of these acts govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the united states 
for a corporation engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a citizen of the us i the corporation must be organized under the laws of the us or of a state  territory  or possession thereof  ii each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors must be a us citizen and no officer who is not a us citizen may act in such person s absence  iii no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens  and iv at least of the interest in such corporation must be owned by us citizens as defined in the acts 
the company would be prohibited from operating its vessels in the us coastwise trade during any period in which the company did not comply with these regulations 
to facilitate compliance  the company s certificate of incorporation i limits ownership by foreigners of any class of its capital stock including its common stock to  so that foreign ownership will not exceed the permitted 
under certain circumstances the company s board of directors may increase this percentage to  ii requires a stock certification system with two types of certificates to aid tracking of ownership  and iii permits the company s board of directors to make such determinations to ascertain ownership and implement such limitations as reasonably may be necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has foreign currency exchange risks primarily related to its offshore marine service vessel operations that are conducted from ports located in the united kingdom where its functional currency is pounds sterling 
the financial statements of the company s united kingdom operations are measured using the pound sterling and changes in the strength of that currency relative to the us dollar and the corresponding adjustment to the net assets of those operations caused by exchange rate fluctuations result in the recognition of currency translation adjustments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the total net assets of pound sterling functional investees as of december  was pound million 
a weakening in the pound sterling to the us dollar exchange rate would result in a change of million to other comprehensive income related to these investments 
to protect certain of the us dollar value of pound sterling denominated net assets of the company from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their conversion to us dollars  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts 
the forward exchange contracts enable the company to sell pounds sterling for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates to offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange on the amount of us dollar cash flows to be derived from the net assets 
the company considers these forward exchange contracts as economic hedges of a net investment as the translation adjustments resulting from the forward exchange contracts move in the opposite direction from the translation adjustments resulting from the restatement of its united kingdom subsidiaries net assets 
at december   the notional and fair values of those forward exchange contracts  which expire at various dates through august  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate of the company s forward exchange contracts at december  was approximately 
pounds sterling per us dollar 
assets of investees with functional currencies other than the pound sterling are not significant to the company 
during  the company also entered into norwegian kroner forward exchange contracts 
these contracts enable the company to buy norwegian kroners for us dollars in the future at fixed exchange rates which could offset possible consequences of changes in foreign exchange rates should the company decide to conduct business in norway 
at december   the notional and fair values of those forward exchange contracts  which expire in january  were approximately nok million  or million  and nok million  or million  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate of the company s forward exchange contracts at december  was approximately nok per us dollar 
the company also collects certain revenues and pays certain expenses in other foreign currencies 
with respect to these foreign currency risks  the company has not entered into hedging contracts and its operating results are positively or negatively affected as these foreign currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar 
the company has entered into and settled various positions in natural gas and crude oil via swaps  options  and futures contracts pursuant to which  on each applicable settlement date  the company receives or pays an amount  if any  by which a contract price for a swap  an option  or a futures contract exceeds the settlement price quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or receives or pays the amount  if any  by which the settlement price quoted on the nymex exceeds the contract price 
the general purpose of these hedge transactions is to provide value to the company should the price of natural gas and crude oil decline which over time  if sustained  would lead to a decline in the company s offshore assets market values and cash flows 
for accounting purposes  the company records the change in market value of its commodity contracts at the end of each month and recognizes a related gain or loss 
at december   the company s positions in commodity contracts were not material
