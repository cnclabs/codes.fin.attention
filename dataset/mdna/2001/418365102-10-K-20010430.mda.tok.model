item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
general hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that combines the sale of books  music  software  periodicals  videocassettes  video games and dvds with the rental of videocassettes  video games and dvds in a superstore and internet web site format 
as of january   we operated superstores averaging  square feet in small to medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
the company also operated one college bookstore 
each of the superstores and the college bookstore is wholly owned by the company and operates under the name of hastings 
our e commerce web site  www 
gohastings 
com  became operational in may our operating strategy is to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding existing superstores  opening new superstores in selected markets  and expanding our offering of products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to fiscal returns process in general  merchandise inventory owned by us is returnable based upon return agreements with our merchandise vendors 
we continually return merchandise to vendors based on  among other factors  current and projected sales trends  overstock situations  authorized return timelines or change in product offerings 
at the end of any reporting period  there is inventory that has been returned to vendors or in the process of being returned to vendors for which we will be charged a fee 
in order to appropriately match the expense associated with the return of merchandise with the process of returning the product  we utilize an allowance for cost of inventory returns the allowance 
to accrue for such fees charged by our vendors and estimate the allowance  we utilize historical experience adjusted for significant fee modifications by our vendors 
the time of year and the product mix of inventory to be returned can have a significant effect on the ultimate cost to return the products  however  we evaluate and adjust the allowance on a quarterly basis 
rental video cost allocation we adopted a new method of amortizing our rental video assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal in late fiscal  we completed a series of direct revenue sharing agreements with major studios  the majority of which were amended in fiscal  under which we acquired approximately of our rental video assets during fiscal we anticipate that our involvement in revenue sharing agreements will continue to increase moderately in the future 
revenue sharing allows us to acquire rental video assets at a lower up front capital cost than traditional buying arrangements 
we then share with studios a percentage of the actual net rental revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time 
the increased access to additional copies of new releases under revenue sharing agreements will allow customer demand for new releases to be satisfied over a shorter period of time at a time when the new releases are most popular 
since this new business model results in a greater proportion of rental revenue to be received over a reduced rental period because there is more product available when product demand is greater  we changed our method of amortizing rental video assets in order to better match expenses with revenues 
under the new amortization method  we continue to expense revenue sharing payments as revenues are recognized under the terms of the specific contracts with supplying studios 
the capitalized cost of all rental video assets acquired for a fixed price is being amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit  except for rental video assets purchased for the initial stock of a new store  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of under the old amortization method  the capitalized cost of base rental video assets typically copies one through four of a title for each store was amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of the capitalized cost of non base units typically copies five and above for each store was amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of the adoption of the accelerated amortization method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and  accordingly  we recorded a non cash  non recurring  pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increasing net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal by million and per share  respectively 
results of operations the following tables present our statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue  and the number of superstores open at the end of period for the three most recent fiscal years 
fiscal year merchandise revenue rental video revenue total revenues merchandise cost of revenue rental video cost of revenue total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses operating loss other income expense interest expense gain on sale of mall stores other  net loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss fiscal year hastings superstores beginning number of stores openings closings ending number of stores four additional superstores will be closed during the first and second quarters fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year increased to million from million for fiscal year the revenue growth consisted of a increase in merchandise revenues and a increase in rental video revenue and was primarily due to the number of new stores opened in fiscal that were open for a full year during fiscal comparable store revenues for fiscal were essentially flat 
sale video  driven by sales of dvds  previously viewed videocassettes  and video games exhibited the largest percentage growth year over year with music and book revenues declining as a result of general weakness in the industries 
gross profit 
total gross profit as a percent of total revenue declined from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of a series of factors as follows i during the first quarter of fiscal  management determined a need to improve inventory turns in order to enhance cash flow  reduce markdown expense  and enhance our inventory offering 
our resulting implementation of an initiative to permanently improve inventory turns generated an increase in the volume of returns to vendors and markdowns as well as compressed the timing of these returns resulting in higher fees per return based on the pricing agreements with our vendors 
this negatively impacted gross profit by a million increase in the cost associated with the return of product  ii lower than anticipated sales volume for certain products in the first three quarters of fiscal resulted in management s decision to increase the markdown frequency on certain products to stimulate sales  increase inventory turnover and improve cash flows 
such retail price markdowns increased approximately million resulting in lower merchandise margins  iii margins were also adversely affected by an increase in freight costs of million for the year ended january  due to freight carriers adding fuel surcharges of to  and iv as circumstances warrant  due to changing market conditions or specific transactions  we record lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
such inventory adjustments increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of our entering into a barter transaction with a third party during fiscal  for which we recorded an asset related to the barter credit in the amount of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the barter company ceased operations and no longer appeared to be a going concern 
consequently  we deemed the entire credit to be fully impaired  which resulted in a charge to income of million in the third quarter of fiscal also contributing to the overall decrease in margin was a decline in rental video margin of approximately million primarily as a result of an increase in rental video revenue subject to revenue sharing agreements with studios as a percent of total rental video revenue  which has lower profit margins 
offsetting the declines in margin outlined above was a million decline in the amount of promotional coupons redeemed during fiscal over fiscal and a reduction in shrinkage of approximately million resulting from an increased focus on loss prevention 
in addition  we experienced an increase in discounts on product purchase prices due to more advantageous buying and improved seasonal terms from our vendors during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of total revenues in fiscal from million or in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of million in accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement of the first three quarters of fiscal and the prior four fiscal years and collective asset impairment charges of million comprised of in writedowns of leasehold improvements included in three underperforming stores and 
million in writedowns of certain assets of the company s internet segment 
such charges were recorded as projected cash flows from these operations were not sufficient to realize the book value of the specific assets 
additionally  during fiscal  we recorded net expenses of million associated with the closure of two stores during the fourth quarter and an additional four stores approved for closure prior to year end 
such expenses are comprised of accruals for the net present value of future minimum lease payments  the write off of leasehold improvements  and other related costs 
during fiscal  we recorded expenses of million related to the closure of six superstores and one college bookstore 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses were  for the year ending january   as we opened one superstore during the year 
for the year ending january   pre opening expenses totaled million with the opening of new superstores 
pre opening expenses include human resource costs  travel  rent  advertising  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a superstore s opening 
interest expense 
despite a higher interest rate environment  our overall interest expense declined approximately million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a lower average balance of long term debt 
income taxes 
due to cumulative losses incurred in recent years  the current balance of the net deferred tax asset does not meet the criteria for recognition under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result  we fully reserved the balance of the net deferred tax asset of million 
we recorded income tax expense of million primarily as the result of the provision for the valuation allowance partially offset by the tax benefit derived from the loss generated in fiscal net loss 
for fiscal year  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal totaled million  an increase of million or over fiscal revenue of million 
the revenue growth consisted of a increase in merchandise revenues and a increase in rental video revenue 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to comparable store revenue growth of and the opening of hastings superstores during fiscal we closed two superstores at the end of fiscal  which had an insignificant effect on total revenue 
each significant revenue category exhibited growth  with video games providing the largest gains on a percentage basis 
gross profit 
total gross profit as a percent of total revenue decreased in fiscal to compared to for excluding the non cash  non recurring  pre tax charge of million discussed above under rental video cost allocation 
this decline was primarily the result of a million pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the write down of certain merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
lower than anticipated sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in management s decision to increase promotional discounts on certain products to stimulate sales and to increase inventory turnover and enhance cash flows 
such discounts resulted in lower of cost or market inventory adjustments 
offsetting these charges was a reduction in total returns expense comprised of the cost of operating our return center and cost associated with the return of merchandise inventory from million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the costs associated with returns settlements with vendors  resulting from an improvement in our vendor settlement process 
the remainder of the gross profit change from fiscal resulted from the increase in merchandise revenues  which generate lower profit margins versus rental revenues  from to of total revenues 
excluding the write down and decrease in returns expense  merchandise gross profit as a percentage of merchandise revenue remained constant at 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for rental video increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  excluding the charge described above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased to of total revenues in fiscal from in fiscal one factor contributing to this increase was the million pre tax charge for the costs associated with the closing of six superstores and one college bookstore 
this charge includes the net present value of future minimum lease payments  write off of primarily leasehold improvements  and other related costs 
two of these superstores were closed as of the end of fiscal  while the remainders were closed during the first quarter of fiscal other factors contributing to the increase in sg a were an increase of approximately million in costs associated with the operation of our internet segment and a million increase in the costs related to our superstore advertising program 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses remained constant at of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal pre opening expenses include human resource costs  travel  rent  advertising  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a superstore s opening 
we opened new superstores in fiscal  compared to new superstores in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense remained constant at million for fiscal compared to gain loss on sale of mall stores 
as a result of the sale of our mall stores to camelot music  inc  we recorded a total pre tax gain of million after tax gain of million in fiscal and fiscal camelot music  inc filed for bankruptcy in august  and we established a reserve of million in fiscal to cover potential losses related to certain mall store leases 
as of january   expenses totaling million had been charged against the reserve 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the reserve was reduced to million  resulting in an increase to pre tax income of million 
by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  all potential liabilities related to the camelot music  inc bankruptcy were settled  and we reduced the remaining reserve to zero resulting in a decrease in pre tax loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million 
net income loss 
we reported a net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal excluding the million pre tax charge for the closing of stores and the million pre tax charge for the write down of merchandise inventory in fiscal  our net income and diluted income per share would have been million and per diluted share  respectively 
excluding the non cash  non recurring  pre tax charge of million discussed above under rental video cost allocation  and the million reversal of the reserve related to the camelot music  inc bankruptcy in fiscal  our fiscal net income and diluted income per share would have been million and per share  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations exclusively from the sale of merchandise and the rental of videocassettes and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchase  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental videos  opening new superstores and expanding existing superstores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our revolving credit facility the facility 
we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under the facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new superstores and superstore expansions through fiscal consolidated cash flows operating activities 
despite an operating loss  net cash flows from operating activities increased million  or  from million for the fiscal year ending january  to million for the fiscal year ending january  the most significant reason for the increase was a decline in and orderly reduction of merchandise inventory of approximately million 
approximately million of this decline was the result of our initiative to increase cash flow and inventory turns by reducing our inventory 
the remaining decrease in inventory is due to added controls on purchasing  markdown management and improved sell through 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reduction was due to a decrease in the number of superstores opened from in fiscal to one in fiscal our capital expenditures include store equipment and fixtures  expanding and remodeling existing superstores  upgrading and implementation of information systems technology and the purchase of rental video assets 
financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under the facility 
with the increase in cash flow from operations and decrease in capital expenditures  we decreased our overall debt balances by approximately million to million as of january  from million as of january   eliminating our term debt by paying off our senior notes and reducing the level of our revolving credit borrowings 
at january  and  we had borrowings outstanding of million and million under our facility and a prior revolving credit facility  respectively 
the average rate of interest charged under the facility and prior revolving credit facility at january  and was and  respectively 
on august   we replaced the prior revolving credit facility and the senior notes by entering into a three year syndicated  secured loan and security agreement with fleet retail finance  inc and the cit group business credit  inc the initial proceeds from the facility were used to prepay the total amounts outstanding under the prior revolving credit facility and the senior notes 
the amount outstanding under the facility is subject to a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory  as defined  and certain rental video assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and is limited to the lesser of i a maximum principal amount of million  which increases to million between october and december of each year of the facility  less a million availability reserve and ii the borrowing base 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental video assets net of accumulated amortization less specifically defined reserves 
the facility bears interest based on the prevailing prime rate or libor plus at our option 
the facility contains no financial covenants  restricts the payment of dividends and certain other debt and acquisition limitations  allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries and is guaranteed by each of our three consolidated subsidiaries 
the facility expires on august  at january   the company had million in excess availability after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
seasonality and inflation as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater portion of our operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the christmas selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of our annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
we experience reduced rentals of video activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of store openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and videocassette titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect our operations 
we do not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact our operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  that impacts our accounting treatment and or our disclosure obligations 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective in fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year 
we are not party to any derivative contracts
