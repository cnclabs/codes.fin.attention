excluding the million stock based compensation charge  we would have reported operating income of million for the year ended december  however  the company did not generate positive operating cash flows in because of a significant increase in working capital 
we expect that we will be able to achieve sustained operating profitability and positive operating cash flows in the future

our principal uses of funds during were million for the acquisition of cns  million for the acquisition of certain product lines from nmt  million in purchases of property and equipment  million of term loan repayments  and million used in operations 
operating cash flow was negative in primarily because of increased inventory to support the growth in the business  increased accounts receivable balances generated from higher product sales  and an increase in demonstration equipment and sample product provided to the significantly larger integra neurosciences sales force
