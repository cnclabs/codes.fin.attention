item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview applied signal technology designs  develops  and manufactures signal processing equipment to collect and process a wide range of telecommunications signals 
this equipment is used for reconnaissance of foreign telecommunications  predominantly by the united states government and allied foreign governments 
commercial applications  performed by the company s subsidiaries  include spectrum monitoring equipment for commercial communication satellite systems and data intrusion detection equipment for data network protection 
signal reconnaissance systems are composed of collection equipment and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consists of sophisticated receivers that scan the radio frequency rf spectrum cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  military transmissions to collect certain signals from  potentially  thousands of signals within the rf spectrum 
processing equipment  using sophisticated software and hardware  evaluates the characteristics of collected signals and selects those signals likely to contain relevant information 
since its inception  the company has focused its efforts primarily on processing equipment  it also provides specialized collection equipment as well as complete signal processing systems 
the company s business involves risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those contained in this report in business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock prices 
the company s revenues are primarily generated from sales of its products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues  and in fiscal  the percentages of revenues derived from these two agencies were and  respectively 
the company s revenues are derived from either fixed price contracts  which provide that the company performs a contract for a fixed price and assumes the risk of any cost overruns  or cost reimbursement contracts  which provide that the company receives the direct and indirect costs of performance plus a negotiated profit 
in fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts 
in fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived from cost reimbursement contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies  or other factors  are borne by the company  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in accounting for cost reimbursement contracts  all costs are charged to operations as incurred including allowable administrative expenses  and revenues are recognized based on costs incurred plus estimated fee rates at the date of evaluation 
in accounting for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percent complete method which is substantially the same as that used for cost reimbursement contracts described above 
all costs are charged to operations as incurred including allowable administrative expenses  and revenues are recognized based on estimated costs and profits at completion on a contract by contract basis 
losses on any individual contracts are provided for at the time they become known 
see note to financial statements 
during fiscal  applied signal technology  created two wholly owned subsidiary corporations to focus on commercial applications of its intellectual property 
enetsecure is positioning itself to be both an information assurance service provider as well as an equipment vendor providing passive monitoring of data networks to detect unauthorized system entry for the purpose of altering or pirating data 
by being an information assurance managed service provider  enetsecure anticipates satisfying the needs of small enterprises that cannot justify investment in their own information assurance capability 
by offering the icemon product as an off the shelf passive monitoring device  enetsecure can satisfy an aspect of the information assurance needs of large enterprises 
transcendent technologies designs  develops  and supports sophisticated network management and spectrum monitoring systems designed to enhance the quality of satellite and terrestrial wireless communications 
the company s board of directors voted to fund each subsidiary  effective the beginning of may the board also approved the transfer of intellectual property developed by the company and capital equipment to each subsidiary 
applied signal technology has subleased office space to each of the subsidiaries at rates equal to those paid by applied signal technology under its leases  which applied signal technology believes are below current market rates 
in addition  applied signal technology has guaranteed long term equipment leases for enetsecure totaling approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal year  the board of directors approved funding each subsidiary an additional  for a total investment of  as of october   neither subsidiary had generated any revenues 
as of october   the cash balances in enetsecure and transcendent technologies were approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
by the middle of december  enetsecure  had expended all its cash reserves 
applied signal technology s board of directors approved a  loan to enetsecure 
the loan will mature in december as a condition to the extension of the enetsecure loan  enetsecure issued a warrant to applied signal technology for the purchase of  shares of common stock of enetsecure at a price of two dollars per share  which will be exercisable until the earlier of ten years from their date of issuance or the occurrence of a liquidity event with respect to enetsecure 
the loan is expected to fund enetsecure through january on january   applied signal technology s board of directors approved up to  of additional funding to enetsecure 
the additional financing is expected to fund enetsecure to approximately the middle of march applied signal technology currently owns of the outstanding capital stock of each subsidiary 
however  certain employees of the subsidiaries have been granted stock options for the subsidiaries common stock 
additionally  each subsidiary is in the process of seeking third party funding and expects that if such funding is secured they would have to issue a significant amount of common stock in connection with such funding 
applied signal technology believes that it cannot adequately finance both subsidiaries throughout all of fiscal there is no assurance that either subsidiary will secure the requisite funding or that either will be successful in obtaining customers or selling its services 
the inability of either subsidiary to secure adequate financing during fiscal could have a material adverse impact on either firm s ability to continue operations

operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts  and  at the end of each period indicated  the company s backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income backlog thousands of dollars revenues revenues from contracts decreased by from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal revenues in fiscal increased by from approximately  in fiscal the decrease in revenues during fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in demand for the company s products and services 
the decrease in demand was caused by what the company believes to be continued delays in the awarding of certain engineering development contracts and to fewer sales of the company s off the shelf products 
the increase in revenues during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated by the company s development and engineering service contracts which was partially offset by a decrease in sales of off the shelf products 
management believes the decrease in revenues resulting from lower off the shelf product sales has adversely impacted revenue growth in fiscal and the following table identifies the source of the company s revenues for fiscal years   and by major market fy fy fy intelligence agencies military foreign commercial backlog the company s backlog  which consists of anticipated revenues from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options  was approximately  at the end of fiscal this represents a decrease of from the prior year s ending backlog of approximately  the decrease in backlog is due  in part  to what the company believes to be continued delays in the awarding of certain engineering development contracts and to fewer orders for the company s off the shelf products 
the increase in backlog between fiscal and fiscal was due  in part  to receiving orders delayed from the previous year and  in part  to a resurgence in the need for signal reconnaissance capabilities by the united states government 
while management believes that the demand for global intelligence and tactical communications systems should continue  there can be no assurances that the company will continue to experience growth in its backlog or its revenue 
contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts  such as labor  materials  and manufacturing overhead costs 
contract costs  as a percentage of revenues  were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in contract costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to a higher manufacturing overhead applied to contracts during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in manufacturing overhead experienced during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in revenues between fiscal and fiscal the decrease in contract costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal year was attributable  in part  to the lowering of reserves related to a government investigation that commenced during fiscal and  in part  to a reduction in estimated losses on certain fixed price contracts 
both reductions reflect management s belief that the risk of loss has been mitigated 
the reserve reduction recorded during fiscal totaled approximately research and development expenses applied signal technology directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through the company s billing rates 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased by approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  and grew as a percentage of revenues in fiscal when compared to the percentage of revenue in fiscal the increase in research and development spending during fiscal is due  in part  to the company continuing its research and development initiatives while awaiting the award of certain engineering development contracts and  in part  to research and development spending by the company s subsidiaries 
the fiscal research and development spending incurred by the company s subsidiaries was approximately  fiscal research and development expense within applied signal technology increased primarily because of a higher manufacturing overhead applied to research and development labor 
the increase in research and development spending during both fiscal year and fiscal year was due to management s decision to increase research and development activities for the benefit of future business 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to the company s marketing and proposal activities  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or of revenues in fiscal year compared to approximately  or of revenues in fiscal year and approximately  or of revenues in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal year was due  in part  to increased marketing expenditures and to a higher general and administrative rate application for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and  in part  to approximately  of general and administrative expenses incurred by the company s subsidiaries 
the increase in the general and administrative rate experienced during fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in revenues between fiscal and fiscal the increase from fiscal year to fiscal year in general and administrative expenses of approximately  and as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to increased efforts in marketing and bid and proposal activity 
in recent years  management has continued to emphasize the marketing component of general and administrative expenses in an effort to generate revenues in future periods 
interest income expense net net interest income expense for fiscal year increased approximately  to approximately  from approximately  of net interest income in fiscal net interest income in fiscal year increased approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the continued increase in interest income during the fiscal years and is due primarily to investing higher cash balances generated from operations 
provision for income taxes income taxes  as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes  have been provided for at a combined federal and state rate of for fiscal year and for both fiscal years and the   and effective tax rates are lower than the combined federal and state statutory rates primarily due to the benefit derived from federal and state income tax credits 
the effective tax rate decreased from and primarily due to lower net income before tax and an increase in the federal and state income tax credits as a percentage of pretax income 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been the cash flow generated from operations as well as the issuance of common stock through its employee stock plans 
the company has a  unsecured  revolving line of credit for short term cash requirements bearing interest at the bank s reference rate as of october  
outstanding amounts on the line of credit were zero at october  and the line expires on march  the line of credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants

net cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities has varied significantly from year to year 
for fiscal years   and  cash provided by operating activities was approximately   and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income  changes in accounts receivable  changes in the level of accrued liabilities  and the change in inventories held by the company 
during fiscal year  net income was approximately  a decrease from approximately  in fiscal year the decrease in net income between fiscal year and fiscal year is due to a decline in sales of the company s products and services  to operating losses in the company s two new subsidiaries of approximately  and to an increase in research and development spending 
the decrease in net income for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the application of a higher general and administrative rate for fiscal year compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  accounts receivable generated cash of approximately  compared to cash used of approximately  for fiscal year the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal year is due to a decline in sales of the company s products and services and to greater cash receipts as a result of improved progress billings during the first and second quarter of fiscal the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal year was primarily due to the strong revenues and associated billings in the fourth quarter of that year 
the decrease in accounts receivable in fiscal was due  in part  to greater collection efforts and  in part  to collections received from a one time billing modification authorized by the united states government in the fourth quarter of fiscal year cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets of approximately  in fiscal year and approximately  in fiscal year is primarily due to the increase in purchases for anticipated future production contracts 
cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets of approximately  in fiscal was due  in part  to the increase in work in progress for engineering and production contracts and  in part  to the increase in prepaid income taxes related to higher profits 
cash used by the decreased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses for fiscal year of approximately  is primarily due to a reduction in the amount of material purchases made by the company during fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash provided by the increased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses for fiscal year of approximately  was primarily due to an increase in accrued employee related benefits  the accrual for the fourth quarter dividend payment  and an increase in trade accounts payable resulting from the higher revenue volume recorded during the last quarter of fiscal the increase in accrued liabilities was partially offset by a reduction in the reserves recorded for previously anticipated losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contract costs 
cash provided by the increased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses for fiscal approximated  and was primarily due to increased tax liabilities associated with higher profit margins 
net cash from investing activities net cash used from investing activities was approximately   and  during fiscal years   and  respectively 
the use of cash from investing activities for fiscal year is primarily due to investments in long term and short term securities primarily in us government treasuries exceeding maturities of such securities by approximately  and property and equipment expenditures of approximately  cash provided by investing activities during fiscal years and were approximately  and  respectively  and were primarily due to the maturity of short term investments in us government treasuries 
the use of cash in investing activities for fiscal years   and was primarily for additions to property and equipment 
net cash from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  during fiscal year compared to approximately  used in financing activities during fiscal year and approximately  used in financing activities during fiscal year during fiscal year  the cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to approximately  received from the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan which was partially offset by approximately  of dividend payments to common shareholders 
during fiscal year  the approximately  used in financing activities was primarily attributable to approximately  used to repurchase shares of common stock and approximately  of dividend payments partially offset by approximately  received from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and the stock option plan 
during fiscal  the  used in financing activities was attributable to approximately  of common stock repurchases initiated under the company s stock repurchase program partially offset by approximately  received from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan 
the company believes that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and amounts currently available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for the next months  however  it will not have sufficient funds to finance the most recently projected needs of its subsidiaries during the month period 
at the beginning of each fiscal year  the company submits a proposal to the defense contract audit agency dcaa to establish the indirect rates that will be applied to the company s contracts with the united states government during the fiscal year 
the company recently submitted its fiscal indirect rate proposal that includes a proposed maximum contribution by the company to help reduce its fiscal projected indirect rates 
if the proposal is accepted and the company contributes the maximum proposed amount  there will be a material impact to the company s profitability and cash reserves 
in the event the maximum contribution is made  the company believes that it will incur a loss for fiscal but still maintain adequate cash balances to continue operations 
applied signal technology believes that enetsecure does not have sufficient funds to meet its cash needs past the end of january enetsecure projects that it will require significant additional financing to fund its operations during fiscal the inability of enetsecure to secure adequate additional financing could have a material adverse impact on the firm s ability to continue operations during fiscal applied signal technology believes that transcendent technologies does not have sufficient funds to meet its cash needs past the end of february transcendent technologies projects that it may require a material amount to fund its operations during fiscal the inability of transcendent technologies to secure adequate additional financing could have a material adverse impact on the firm s ability to continue operations during fiscal applied signal technology believes that it cannot adequately finance both subsidiaries throughout all of fiscal the company is working closely with each subsidiary to try and secure adequate financing from third parties to continue operations of each subsidiary 
the inability of either subsidiary to secure adequate financing during fiscal could have a material adverse impact on either firm s ability to continue operations 
the possible future impact to applied signal technology of discontinued operations of either of its subsidiaries is not known at this time
