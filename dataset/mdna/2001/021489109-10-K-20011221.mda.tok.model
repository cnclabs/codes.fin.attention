item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
overview we provide converged ip phone systems for small and mid sized business 
we were incorporated in may and began operations in july from inception through july  we were a development stage company and had no revenues 
during this period  our operating activities consisted primarily of developing our initial product  recruiting personnel  raising capital and building our corporate infrastructure 
we first recognized revenues from product sales of our quantum board and altiware software in july we generated net revenues of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we derive our revenues from sales of our altiserv system  which includes quantum boards  triton boards and altiware software 
product revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
revenues from product sales to end users are recognized upon shipment 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors until they resell our products to their customers 
upon shipment  we also provide for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty 
under our distribution contracts  a distributor has the right in certain circumstances to return products it determines are overstocked  so long as it provides an offsetting purchase order for products in an amount equal to or greater than the dollar value of the returned products 
in addition  we afford distributors protection from subsequent price reductions 
our cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
software sales typically carry a higher gross margin than hardware sales 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flows from operations in each quarterly and annual period since our inception and we currently expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
as of september   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california income tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset income in future years 
the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various periods from to if they are not utilized 
under current tax law  net operating loss carryforwards available in any given year may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events  including changes of ownership interest 
we have not recognized any future tax benefits of our cumulative net operating losses due to uncertainty as to future realizability 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  consolidated statements of operations data revenues  net cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative deferred stock compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income  net net loss fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues  net 
revenues consist of sales to end users including resellers and to distributors 
net revenues decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing a decrease of 
the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of worsened general economic conditions which significantly reduced demand for our phone system products in in addition  we believe that the terrorist attacks of september  caused some of our customers to reduce  cancel or reschedule orders for our products and intensified the economic slowdown 
as a result of heightened economic uncertainty  we are experiencing increased difficulty in predicting future sales and may not meet revenue expectations for future periods 
our revenues may continue to decrease 
sales to distributors tech data  altisys  ingram micro  and synnex accounted for approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year and approximately   and respectively  of our revenues in fiscal year during  we terminated tech data as a distributor of our products and increased sales to altisys  ingram micro and synnex 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues in fiscal year increased to million from approximately million in fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues also increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to inventory write downs needed to reflect the slowdown in telecommunications capital spending and the general downturn in the us economy 
during fiscal year  we increased our provision for excess inventory by million as a result of decreased demand for our products  especially in the second half of fiscal year management continues to closely monitor the company s inventory levels 
further declines in demand  although not currently anticipated  would result in reduced sales  increased operating losses and additional inventory provisions 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to hiring of additional engineers  related personnel expenses and consultant fees 
we currently intend to increase research and development expenses in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future to allow to develop new products  features  and expand into new markets in asia pacific 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat at million in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  and promotional expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term due to the uncertainty of customers spending patterns in the current economic environment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in legal fees as a result of the settlement of litigation with sonoma systems  inc see part i  item  legal proceedings and the company s effort to reduce its cost structure during the current economic downturn 
consequently in the near term  we expect to maintain general and administrative expenses at the same level 
however  in order to continue to build our infrastructure to support the growth of our business  it may be necessary to increase general and administrative expenses 
deferred stock compensation expense 
deferred stock compensation expense was  in fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the aggregate deferred stock compensation charge was reduced during fiscal year by approximately  due to the cancellation of approximately  options 
deferred stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of stock compensation charges resulting from granting stock options at exercise prices below the deemed fair value of our common stock on the dates the options were granted 
we are amortizing these amounts using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related stock options 
we expect to amortize approximately  of this deferred stock compensation in fiscal year and  in fiscal year  increasing our loss or reducing any profits that we may have 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the company invested the proceeds from our initial public offering in october in highly liquid  short term and long term investments 
the decrease was due to decreases in invested principal due to cash being used in operations as well as a decrease in interest rates 
we expect net interest and other income to continue to decrease as a result of further decreases in cash available to invest and relatively flat or lower interest rates 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september revenues  net 
revenues consist of sales to end users including dealers and to distributors 
net revenues increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  representing an increase of

cost of revenues in fiscal year increased to million from approximately million in fiscal year cost of revenues decreased as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily a result of production efficiencies as well as lower component and overhead costs due to increased production 
in addition  the cost of revenues in fiscal year includes a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of  related primarily to the impact of design changes to our quantum product 
as a result of higher sales and lower costs  gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to hiring of additional engineers  and increased resources dedicated to release of new products 
additionally  the company expanded research and development facilities in china  resulting in increased depreciation and spending on design and simulation of software

interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year this increase was due primarily to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances between periods 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities 
we have raised an aggregate of million  net of offering expenses  through the sale of preferred stock 
we have also received additional funds from the exercise of stock options 
on october   we received cash proceeds  net of underwriters discounts and commissions  and expenses previously paid of million  totaling approximately million upon the closing of our initial public offering 
as of september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million  comprising of cash deposited in checking and money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months and million of highly liquid short term investments 
net cash used in our operating activities was million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected the impact of the net loss for each of the periods  as well as working capital required to fund our growth in operations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal year  which was primarily a result of redemption of short and long term investments 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million  which was primarily a result of purchases of short and long term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was  for fiscal year  which was primarily a result of redemption of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal year  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and investments in our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year  which was primarily due to million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares of common stock on october  including exercise of underwriter s over allotment option 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year  which was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of series d preferred stock 
we currently believe that existing cash and cash equivalents balances and short term investments  will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our operations for the next months 
our management intends to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities 
subsequently  we may need to raise additional funds  and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products  or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we can not raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our net tangible book value per share may decrease  the percentage ownership of then current stockholders may be diluted  and such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued sfas no 
s and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles 
fasb requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fasb  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment applying a fair value based test 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
the company does not believe that the adoption of these statements will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in april  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
this issue concluded that certain consumer and trade sales promotion expenses are presumed to be a reduction of the selling price of the vendor s products and therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
that presumption can be overcome if the provisions of this pronouncement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt this pronouncement in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas establishes one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal operations 
sfas supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and the reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and result of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
risks related to altigen we have a history of losses and expect to incur future losses  which may prevent us from becoming profitable 
we have experienced operating losses since our inception 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses may be substantial 
further  we expect our operating cash flows to be negative for the foreseeable future 
because we expect increased expenditures for product development and general and administrative expenses  and substantial increases in sales and marketing expenses  we will need to increase revenues significantly to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows 
even if we do achieve profitability and positive operating cash flows  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and our future prospects 
we shipped our first products in july as a result of our limited operating history  we have limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our business 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and challenges we might encounter because we are at an early stage of development in a new and rapidly evolving market 
to address these risks and achieve profitability and increased sales levels  we must 
establish and increase market acceptance of our technology  products and systems  
expand our network of distributors  dealers and companies that buy our products in bulk  customize them for particular applications or customers  and resell them under their own names  
introduce products and systems incorporating our technology and enhancements to our product applications on a timely basis  
respond effectively to competitive pressures  and 
successfully market and support our products and systems 
we may not successfully meet any of these challenges  and our failure to do so will seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and harm our business 
our operating results vary  making future operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  may cause our operating results to vary  including 
our sales cycle  which may vary substantially from customer to customer  
unfavorable changes in the prices and delivery of the components we purchase  
the size and timing of orders for our products  which may vary depending on the season  and the contractual terms of those orders  
the size and timing of our expenses  including operating expenses and expenses of developing new products and product enhancements  
deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products  services or product enhancements introduced by us or by our competitors  and 
our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products 
our budgets and commitments that we have made for the future are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly  and consequently our operating results may suffer 
our dealers often require immediate shipment and installation of our products 
as a result  we have historically operated with limited backlog  and our sales and operating results in any quarter depend primarily on orders booked and shipped during that quarter 
any of the above factors could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as indicators of our future performance 
our market is highly competitive  and we may not have the resources to compete adequately 
the market for our integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as existing competitors develop new products and new competitors enter the market 
we believe that a critical component to success in this market is the ability to establish and maintain strong partner and customer relationships with a wide variety of domestic and international providers 
if we fail to establish or maintain these relationships  we will be at a serious competitive disadvantage 
we face competition from companies providing traditional private telephone systems 
our principal competitors that produce traditional private telephone systems are avaya communications  nec and nortel networks 
we also compete against providers of multifunction telecommunications systems  including artisoft  inc  shoreline steelworks  inc  com corporation  and cisco systems  inc  as well as any number of future competitors 
many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have significantly greater name recognition  financial  sales and marketing  technical  customer support  manufacturing and other resources 
these competitors may also have more established distribution channels and stronger relationships with service providers 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products 
these competitors may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less expensive  provide higher performance or additional features or be introduced earlier than our solutions 
we also expect that other companies may enter our market with better products and technologies 
if any technology that is competing with ours is more reliable  faster  less expensive or has other advantages over our technology  then the demand for our products and services could decrease and harm our business 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
a description of our principal competitors and the competitive nature of our market are discussed in greater detail in business competition 
losing any of our key distributors would harm our business 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
sales through our three key distributors  altisys  ingram micro inc and synnex  accounted for of our net revenues in the fiscal year ended september  and sales to synnex alone accounted for of our net revenues 
our business and operating results will suffer if any one of these distributors does not continue distributing our products  fails to distribute the volume of our products that it currently distributes or fails to expand our customer base 
we also need to establish and maintain relationships with additional distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
we may not be able to establish  or successfully manage  relationships with additional distribution partners 
in addition  our agreements with distributors typically provide for termination by either party upon written notice to the other party 
for example  our agreement with ingram micro provides for termination  with or without cause  by either party upon days written notice to the other party  or upon insolvency or bankruptcy 
our agreements with synnex and altisys each have terms of one year and are automatically renewed for additional one year terms 
each party under these agreements may terminate with or without cause upon days written notice prior to the expiration of any annual term or for cause with days written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure the breach within days following delivery of the notice 
in addition  the agreements with synnex and altisys each provide that either party may terminate the agreement days after a petition for bankruptcy or insolvency has been filed and not dismissed or immediately if the other party terminates its business 
generally  these agreements are non exclusive and distributors sell products that compete with ours 
if we fail to establish or maintain relationships with distributors and original equipment manufacturers  our ability to increase or maintain our sales and our customer base will be substantially harmed 
we sell our products through resellers and distributors  which limits our ability to control the timing of our sales  and this makes it more difficult to predict our revenues 
we do not recognize revenue from the sale of our products to our distributors until these products are sold to either resellers or end users 
we have little control over the timing of product sales to dealers and end users 
our lack of control over the revenue which we recognize from our distributors sales to resellers and end users limits our ability to predict revenue for any given period 
our budgets and commitments that we have made for the future are based in part on our expectations of future sales 
if our sales do not meet expectations  it will be difficult for us to reduce our expenses quickly  and consequently our operating results may suffer 
we rely on sole sourced components and third party technology and products  if these components are not available  our business may suffer 
we purchase technology from third parties that is incorporated into our products  including virtually all of our hardware products 
we order sole sourced components using purchase orders and do not have supply contracts for them 
one sole sourced component  a zarlink corporation chip  is particularly important to our business because it is included in virtually all of our hardware products 
if we were unable to purchase an adequate supply of these sole sourced components on a timely basis  we would be required to develop alternative solutions 
this could entail qualifying an alternative source or redesigning our products based on different components 
our inability to obtain these sole sourced components  especially the zarlink corporation chip  could significantly delay shipment of our products  which could have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and assembly 
we rely on resellers to promote  sell  install and support our products  and their failure to do so may substantially reduce our sales and thus seriously harm our business 
we rely on resellers who can provide high quality sales and support services 
as with our distributors  we compete with other telecommunications systems providers for our resellers business  as our reseller generally market competing products 
if a reseller promotes a competitor s products to the detriment of our products or otherwise fails to market our products and services effectively  we could lose market share 
in addition  the loss of a key reseller or the failure of resellers to provide adequate customer service could cause our business to suffer 
if we do not properly train our reseller to sell  install and service our products  our business will suffer 
software or hardware errors may seriously harm our business and damage our reputation  causing loss of customers and revenues 
users expect telephone systems to provide a high level of reliability 
our products are inherently complex and may have undetected software or hardware errors 
we have detected and may continue to detect errors and product defects in our installed base of products  new product releases and product upgrades 
for example  a small number of our boards failed and were returned 
we have replaced these boards and made certain design changes 
we cannot be sure that the problem has been fully addressed and that similar or different problems may not occur in existing or new boards in the future 
in addition  end users may install  maintain and use our products improperly or for purposes for which they were not designed 
these problems may degrade or terminate the operation of our products  which could cause end users to lose telephone service  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  damage our reputation and cause significant customer relations problems 
any significant delay in the commercial introduction of our products due to errors or defects  any design modifications required to correct these errors or defects or any negative effect on customer satisfaction as a result of errors or defects could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any claims brought because of problems with our products or services could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently offer a one year hardware guarantee to end users 
if our products fail within the first year  we face replacement costs 
our insurance policies may not provide sufficient or any coverage should a claim be asserted 
in addition  our introduction of products and systems with reliability  quality or compatibility problems could result in reduced revenues  uncollectible accounts receivable  delays in collecting accounts receivable  warranties and additional costs 
our customers  end users or employees could find errors in our products and systems after we have begun to sell them  resulting in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  their acceptance by the markets in which we compete 
further  we may experience significant product returns in the future 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may face infringement issues that could harm our business by requiring us to license technology on unfavorable terms or temporarily or permanently cease sales of key products 
we may become parties to litigation in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex litigation are difficult to predict 
we are not currently party to any material litigation 
we have settled intellectual property litigation with sonoma systems  inc ssi  formerly netphone  inc in april  the netphone ssi litigation ended with a compromise settlement and release of all claims and defenses associated with the litigation  in addition to a patent and cross license agreement between the parties 
more generally  litigation related to these types of claims may require us to acquire licenses under third party patents which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues in the future will come from sales of software applications for our hardware products 
the software market has traditionally experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of products in violation of developers intellectual property rights 
this activity is difficult to detect  and legal proceedings to enforce developers intellectual property rights are often burdensome and involve a high degree of uncertainty and substantial costs 
any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and competitive position 
our success depends  to a certain extent  upon our proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law  together with non disclosure and invention assignment agreements  to establish and protect the proprietary rights in the technology used in our products 
although we have filed patent applications  we are not certain that our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any patents issued will provide commercially significant protection to our technology 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information not covered by patents to which we own rights  may obtain access to our know how or may claim to have issued patents that prevent the sale of one or more of our products 
also  it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our proprietary information without our authorization 
further  the laws of some countries  such as those in japan  one of our target markets  may not adequately protect our intellectual property or may be uncertain 
our success also depends on trade secrets that cannot be patented and are difficult to protect 
if we fail to protect our proprietary information effectively  or if third parties use our proprietary technology without authorization  our competitive position and business will suffer 
a description of our dependence on proprietary technology is discussed in greater detail in business intellectual property 
our products may not meet the legal standards required for their sale in some countries  if we cannot sell our products in these countries  our results of operations may be seriously harmed 
the united states and other countries in which we intend to sell our products have standards for safety and other certifications that must be met for our products to be legally sold in those countries 
we have tried to design our products to meet the requirements of the countries in which we sell or plan to sell them 
we have also obtained or are trying to obtain the certifications that we believe are required to sell our products in these countries 
however  we cannot guarantee that our products meet all of these standards or that we will be able to obtain any certifications required 
in addition  there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the products we offer and may offer in the future 
these laws or regulations may include  for example  more stringent safety standards  requirements for additional or more burdensome certifications or more stringent consumer protection laws 
if our products do not meet a country s standards or we do not receive the certifications required by a country s laws or regulations  then we may not be able to sell those products in that country 
this may seriously harm our results of operation by reducing our sales or requiring us to invest significant resources to conform our products to these standards 
our market is subject to changing preferences  failure to keep up with these changes would result in our losing market share  thus seriously harming our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers and end users expect frequent product introductions and have changing requirements for new products and features 
therefore  to be competitive  we will need to develop and market new products and product enhancements that respond to these changing requirements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our failure to do so promptly and cost effectively would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  introducing new products could require us to write off existing inventory as obsolete  which could harm our results of operations 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
we may not be successful in managing any future growth 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception 
in order to manage this expansion and to grow in the future  we will need to expand or enhance our management  manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing capabilities 
we may not be able to hire the management  staff or other personnel required to do so 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned operational systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
difficulties in installing and implementing new systems  procedures and controls may significantly burden our management and our internal resources 
delays in the implementation of new systems or operational disruptions when we transition to new systems would impair our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
lead times for materials and components used in the assembly of our products vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if orders do not match forecasts  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our planned expansion in international markets will involve new risks that our previous domestic operations have not prepared us to address  our failure to address these risks could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of our net revenues came from customers outside of the united states 
we intend to expand our international sales and marketing efforts 
our efforts are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks include 
tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  such as import or export licensing imposed by foreign countries  especially on technology  
potential adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could make our products relatively more expensive in foreign markets  and 
conflicting regulatory requirements in different countries that may require us to invest significant resources customizing our products for each country 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  our failure to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  particularly engineers and sales and marketing personnel 
we need highly trained technical personnel to design and support our server based telecommunications systems 
in addition  we need highly trained sales and marketing personnel to expand our marketing and sales operations in order to increase market awareness of our products and generate increased revenues 
competition for highly trained personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area where most of our operations are located 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in our recruitment and retention efforts 
if we fail to attract or retain qualified personnel or suffer from delays in hiring required personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
our facility is vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters and other business interruptions  any such damage could seriously or completely impair our business 
we perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility in fremont  california 
our facility is located on or near known earthquake fault zones and may be subject to rolling electrical blackouts and is vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if such a disaster or interruption occurs  our ability to perform final assembly  software installation and testing of our products at our facility would be seriously  if not completely  impaired 
if we were unable to obtain an alternative place or way to perform these functions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would suffer 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct operations  and california s current energy crisis could disrupt our business and increase our expenses 
california is in the midst of an energy crisis that could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage that is  when power reserves for california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout california 
we currently have only limited backup generators for emergency alternate sources of power in the event of blackout 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facility 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facility could delay shipments of our products to customers  and could result in lost revenue  which could harm our business and results of operations 
our strategy to outsource assembly and test functions in the future could delay delivery of products  decrease quality or increase costs 
based on volume or customer requirements  we may begin outsourcing some assembly and test functions 
in addition  we may determine that we need to establish assembly and test operations overseas to better serve our international customers 
establishing overseas assembly and test operations may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate 
this outsourcing strategy involves certain risks  including the potential lack of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yield  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractor were to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture or test our products in the required volumes  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
finding replacements could take time  and we cannot be sure that additional sources would be available to us on a timely basis 
any delay or increase in costs in the assembly and testing of products by third party subcontractors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing and assembly operations are discussed in greater detail in business manufacturing and assembly 
if we are unable to comply with nasdaq s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
our common stock trades on nasdaq national market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
if the minimum closing bid price per share is less than for a period of consecutive business days  our shares may be delisted following a days notice period during which the minimum closing bid price must be or above per share for a period of consecutive business days  if we do not file an appeal 
during fiscal year and thereafter  the minimum bid price for our common stock closed  at times  below per share 
the result of delisting from the nasdaq national market would be a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in our common stock and a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
delisting would reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they could have done in the past 
this lack of liquidity would make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
although we are working to comply with all continued listing requirements of nasdaq  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy such requirements 
on september   the nasdaq temporarily suspended the minimum closing bid price requirement 
the suspension will last until january  risks related to the industry integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems may not achieve widespread acceptance  and our fixed costs in the short run could cause our operating results and business to suffer 
the market for integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems is relatively new and rapidly evolving 
businesses have invested substantial resources in the existing telecommunications infrastructure  including traditional private telephone systems  and may be unwilling to replace these systems in the near term or at all 
businesses may also be reluctant to adopt integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems because of their concern about the current limitations of data networks  including the internet 
for example  end users sometimes experience delays in receiving calls and reduced voice quality during calls when routing calls over data networks 
moreover  businesses that begin to route calls over the same networks that currently carry only their data may also experience these problems if the networks do not have sufficient capacity to carry all of these communications at the same time 
we incur many fixed costs in anticipation of a certain level of revenues 
if businesses defer purchasing or decide not to purchase integrated  multifunction telecommunications systems and the market for our products does not grow or grows substantially more slowly than we anticipate  our operating results will suffer and our business will be harmed because we will be unable to reduce fixed costs in the short term to offset the reduced revenues 
future regulation or legislation could harm our business or increase our cost of doing business 
in april  the federal communications commission submitted a report to congress stating that it may regulate certain internet services if it determines that such internet services are functionally equivalent to conventional telecommunications services 
the increasing growth of the voice over data network market and the popularity of supporting products and services  however  heighten the risk that national governments will seek to regulate the transmission of voice communications over networks such as the internet 
in addition  large telecommunications companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of this market so as to benefit their interests  which may be contrary to our interests 
these regulations may include  for example  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing tariffs or imposing regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services 
future laws  legal decisions or regulations  as well as changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could require us to expend significant resources to comply with them 
in addition  these future events or changes may create uncertainty in our market that could reduce demand for our products 
evolving standards may delay our product introductions  increase our product development costs or cause end users to defer or cancel plans to purchase our products  any of which could adversely affect our business 
the standards in our market are still evolving 
these standards are designed to ensure that integrated  multifunction telecommunications products from different manufacturers can operate together 
some of these standards are proposed by other participants in our market  including some of our competitors  and include proprietary technology 
in recent years  these standards have changed  and new standards have been proposed  in response to developments in our market 
our failure to conform our products to existing or future standards may limit their acceptance by market participants 
we may not anticipate which standards will achieve the broadest acceptance in our market in the future  and we may take a significant amount of time and expense to adapt our products to these standards 
we may also have to pay additional royalties to developers of proprietary technologies that become standards in our market 
these delays and expenses may seriously harm our results of operations 
in addition  customers and users may defer or cancel plans to purchase our products due to concerns about the ability of our products to conform to existing standards or to adapt to new or changed standards  and this could seriously harm our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest risk 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage the exposure of financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
these securities are highly liquid and generally mature within months from the purchase date 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed an analysis to assess the potential effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of any change in foreign currency exchange rates is not expected to be material to our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rate would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
