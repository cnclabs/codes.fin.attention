item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview baycorp derives substantially all of its revenue through its energy trading activities and its equity interest in great bay and little bay 
great bay and little bay are electric generating companies whose principal asset is a combined joint ownership interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
baycorp reported net losses for the years ended december     and reported net income for the year ended december  the net loss was primarily attributable to the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized losses on firm forward energy trading contracts and the seabrook refueling outage 
the net loss was primarily due to costs associated with the refueling outage that began on march   with the plant resuming full operating capacity on may  the net loss was primarily due to unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during the year and to the charge related to the termination of a power marketing agreement between great bay and peco energy company 
the net loss was primarily due to scheduled and unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during that year 
the net income was primarily due to a gain of  from the sale of unused steam generators from seabrook unit the seabrook project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
baycorp incurs losses during outage periods due to the loss of all revenues from the sale of generation and additional costs associated with the outages as well as continuing operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation 
unscheduled outages or operation of the unit at reduced capacity can occur due to the automatic operation of safety systems following the detection of a malfunction 
in addition  it is possible for the unit to be shut down or operated at reduced capacity based on the results of scheduled and unscheduled inspections and routine surveillance by seabrook project personnel 
it is not possible for baycorp to predict the frequency or duration of any future unscheduled outages  however  it is likely that such unscheduled outages will occur 
the seabrook project conducted a refueling outage in  which began on october  this refueling outage was scheduled for approximately days  however due to unexpected mechanical problems  the seabrook project did not return to full power until february  refueling outages are generally scheduled every months depending upon the seabrook project capacity factor and the rate at which the nuclear fuel is consumed 
the next refueling outage is scheduled to begin in may the following discussion focuses solely on operating revenues and operating expenses that are presented in a substantially consistent manner for all of the periods discussed 
results of operations operating revenues baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately million  or  to  as compared to  for this increase was primarily attributable to increases in selling prices in as compared to during  the sales price per kilowatt hour kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in sales of electricity decreased slightly by approximately to  kwhs in as compared to  kwhs in the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity as compared to a capacity factor of for operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on october  a return to full power was expected on november  the outage was extended when damage to one of the plant s emergency diesel generators occurred  requiring an extensive repair effort 
the plant returned to full power on february  operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage that began on march  the plant resumed full operating capacity on may  great bay purchased approximately  kwhs for resale in primarily to cover firm contracts during the extended outage in the fourth quarter 
great bay purchased approximately  kwhs in to cover firm contracts and for resale 
average purchase prices for power were approximately cents per kwh in and cents per kwh in great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by kwhs sold during the applicable period increased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this increase was primarily the result of the expense associated with the unrealized losses on firm forward contracts of approximately million in as compared to  in baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately million  or  to  as compared with  for this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales by great bay of power purchased in the open market in the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity as compared to a capacity factor of for operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on march the plant resumed full operating capacity on may and operated at full capacity thru december  in contrast  while there was no refueling outage in  the seabrook project had approximately unscheduled outage days in sales of electricity increased by approximately to  kwhs in as compared to  kwhs in during  the sales price per kwh increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in great bay s cost of power decreased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this decrease was primarily the result of the higher capacity factor at the seabrook project during as compared to scheduled and unscheduled outage time increases great bay s cost of power because seabrook costs are spread over fewer kwhs 
expenses baycorp s total operating expenses for increased million  or  in comparison with this increase was primarily the result of the non cash charge to earnings for unrealized losses on firm energy trading contracts 
unrealized losses for firm energy trading contracts was  for as compared to  for in december  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf requires energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet  with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
the effects of initial application of eitf were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
financial statements for periods prior to initial adoption of eitf were not restated 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change as of january  was an increase in net income of approximately  to recognize gains on net open physical purchase and sales commitments considered to be trading activity 
production costs increased approximately million  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily the result of the company s increased ownership in the seabrook project  from approximately for the first eleven months of to approximately for december and all of in addition  the increase in operating expenses in as compared to was attributable to the costs associated with the extended refueling outage in the fourth quarter of purchased power expenses increased approximately million  or  from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the purchase price of power in as compared to purchased power expenses have increased primarily because great bay purchased power in and in the open market to resell to third parties and to cover firm sales during scheduled and unscheduled outages in and as great bay enters into more sales transaction agreements to supply firm power  great bay s expenses to purchase power to cover firm power obligations during scheduled and unscheduled outages may increase 
administrative and general expenses increased approximately  or  from  in to  in depreciation and amortization increased approximately  or  from  in to  in these increases were primarily attributable to the increased ownership in the seabrook project in as compared to taxes other than income increased approximately  or  from  in to  in in addition to expenses increasing as a result of the company s increased ownership in the seabrook project  great bay also received a property tax refund in as settlement for changes in assessed property values 
interest income increased approximately  or  from  in to  in  primarily due to higher average cash balances during as compared to decommissioning cost accretion increased  or  to  in as compared to  in this accretion is a non cash charge that reflects great bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the seabrook project in current year dollars over the licensing period during which the seabrook project is licensed to operate 
decommissioning trust fund income increased  or  to  in as compared to  in the increase in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the higher fund balances as great bay continued to make contributions to the great bay decommissioning trust fund and the addition of the little bay decommissioning trust funds in other income increased approximately  or  to  in as compared to  in  primarily due to miscellaneous sales of unit equipment at seabrook 
equity loss in houstonstreet investment was  in and  in as of december   the company owned of houstonstreet 
the company recognized its ownership share of houstonstreet s losses   for houstonstreet raised additional equity in from outside investors and as a result  as of december   the company s ownership fell below  to 
subsequently  the company deconsolidated houstonstreet as of december  and started accounting for this investment on the equity method 
the net financial impact of this deconsolidation was  recorded in see note investment in unconsolidated affiliates 
baycorp s total operating expenses for increased million  or  in comparison with this increase was primarily the result of purchased power costs in purchased power increased approximately  from  in to  in purchased power expenses have increased primarily because great bay purchased power in in the open market to resell to third parties and to cover firm sales during unscheduled outages in production costs decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of fewer unscheduled outage days in compared to administrative and general expenses decreased approximately million  or  from  in to  in depreciation and amortization decreased approximately  or  from  in to  in in  the company recognized  in unrealized losses on firm energy trading contracts 
there was no comparable charge in the effects of initial application of eitf were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
financial statements for periods prior to initial adoption of eitf were not restated 
other deductions increased million  or  in as compared to this increase was primarily attributable to the equity loss in houstonstreet investment in there was no houstonstreet investment in decommissioning cost accretion increased  or  to million in as compared to million in decommissioning trust fund income increased  or  to  in as compared to  in the increase in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the higher fund balance as great bay continued to make contributions to the decommissioning trust fund 
net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire between and because the company has experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on the ability of the company to use million of these carryforwards 
the company s best estimate at this time is that the annual limitation on the use of million of the company s nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to the company s restricted nol s is available for use in future years until such nol s are scheduled to expire 
the company s other million of nols are not currently subject to such limitations 
liquidity and capital resources baycorp s subsidiary  great bay  currently sells most of its power in the northeast united states short term wholesale power market 
the cash generated from electricity sales by great bay was sufficient to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements in if the seabrook project operates at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity decrease from current price levels  baycorp or great bay would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that baycorp or great bay will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
during  the company loaned  to houstonstreet 
due to the continuous losses at houstonstreet  the company wrote down its equity investment in houstonstreet and subsequently its loan and receivable from houstonstreet 
as of december   the company had no investments or receivables from houstonstreet recognized on its balance sheet 
baycorp s total cash and short term investments increased approximately million during liquidity improved principally because baycorp s operating revenues exceeded its cash operating expenses in operating expenses consist of both cash and non cash charges 
the company had a net loss for of approximately million 
this loss included a non cash charge to income in of approximately million for unrealized losses on firm energy trading contracts 
other non cash charges to income included million for the equity loss in houstonstreet  million for depreciation and amortization  million for nuclear fuel amortization and million for decommissioning trust fund accretion 
a decrease in prepaids and other assets of approximately million was primarily due to the timing of funding as requested by seabrook for operating expenses 
there was an increase in accounts payable of approximately million primarily due to purchased power expenses of million for november and december offsetting these non cash charges to income were cash charges to income including a million increase in december accounts receivable 
other cash charges included approximately million for capital expenditures and million for nuclear fuel 
great bay s decommissioning payments totaled approximately million 
the decommissioning funding schedule is determined by the ndfc  which reviews the schedule for the seabrook project at least annually 
great bay expects to use revenues from the sale of power to make decommissioning payments 
see business decommissioning 
great bay and little bay anticipate that their share of the seabrook project s capital expenditures for the fiscal year will total approximately million for nuclear fuel and various capital projects 
in addition  great bay and little bay are required under the joa to pay their share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including  without limitation  operation and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of the level of seabrook unit s operations 
on february   great bay executed a purchase power agreement with select whereby great bay will sell mws of energy associated with seabrook to select in exchange for mws of energy associated with millstone unit and mws of energy associated with millstone unit the term of this agreement is april  through december  delivery of power from either company is contingent on each of the units operating at certain capacity 
as part of the agreement  select made a prepayment of million to great bay in february and a second prepayment of million is required in march great bay is compensating select for the prepayments by i paying annual interest for the period from february  through march  and ii giving select a price differential for the power being exchanged until such time as the select prepayment has been repaid 
in order to collateralize the transaction  great bay and little bay have each provided select with a mortgage lien and security interest in their respective interests in the seabrook project 
once great bay has repaid select  the mortgage liens and security interests will be released and there will be no price differential in exchanging power throughout the remaining terms of the agreement 
the company s principal asset available to serve as collateral for borrowings is great bay s and little bay s combined interest in the seabrook project 
pursuant to a purchased power agreement  dated as of april   between great bay and unitil  great bay s interest in the seabrook project is encumbered by a mortgage 
this mortgage may be subordinated to up to million of senior secured financing 
also  as noted above  in order to collateralize the transaction with select  great bay and little bay each provided select with a mortgage lien and security interest in their respective interests in the seabrook project 
see business purchased power agreements 
seabrook unit transmits its generated power to the new england kilovolt transmission grid  a major network of interconnecting lines covering new england  through three separate transmission lines emanating from the station 
on march   the seabrook project began experiencing interruptions of the connections to the transmission system due to icing from a severe winter storm that resulted in the plant automatically tripping offline 
during this shutdown  a problem was identified with the steam driven emergency feedwater pump and plant chemistry personnel detected the presence of chlorides in the condenser hotwells  indicating leakage of seawater into the condenser 
repair of the emergency feedwater pump were completed allowing the plant to return on line on march  power was limited to approximately while plant personnel continued to repair the condenser leakage 
on march   plant operators identified a problem with the main turbine valve control system requiring that the plant be taken off line 
after repairs were completed  the plant was placed on line on march  and power was increased to approximately 
the plant reached full power on march  management believes the plant will operate at historical levels and believes that it will be able to fulfill its obligations with respect to the agreement with select 
as mentioned previously  if this does not happen  the company will be required to raise additional funding 
the company expects that houstonstreet expenses and capital expenditures will substantially exceed houstonstreet s revenues until late in houstonstreet raised approximately million from investors to date 
on march   houstonstreet received commitments to receive up to approximately million in additional funding  including  from baycorp 
although houstonstreet has received some of the funding  until the closing of the financing  there can be no assurance that houstonstreet will receive the balance of the committed funds 
this financing involves the sale by houstonstreet of senior secured notes  warrants to purchase houstonstreet preferred stock and warrants to purchase houstonstreet common stock 
in march  baycorp entered into discussion with houstonstreet involving the conversion of baycorp s million loan made in september  together with approximately million in accrued interest and penalties on the note and past due management fees  into approximately million of houstonstreet series c units 
there can be no assurance that this proposed financing will be successfully completed 
the loan  accrued interest and receivables from houstonstreet had been written down to zero at december   and as such  the conversion of these amounts will have no accounting impact 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or its subsidiaries to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
history of losses baycorp has never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
historically  electricity sales at short term rates have not resulted in sufficient revenue to enable baycorp to meet its cash requirements for operations  maintenance and capital related costs 
in addition  and despite recently increasing prices for electricity in the northeast united states  there can be no assurance that great bay or little bay will be able to sell power at prices that will enable them to meet their cash requirements 
liquidity needs as of december   baycorp had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by great bay and little bay  will be sufficient to enable the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries to meet their cash requirements in however  if in or thereafter  the seabrook project operated at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay and little bay are able to sell their share of the seabrook project electricity decrease from current price levels  the company or its wholly owned subsidiaries would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
in any event  the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries will likely need to raise additional capital from outside sources 
there is no assurance that the company or its subsidiaries would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
factors related to great bay and little bay primary reliance on a single asset 
baycorp s principal source of revenue is its wholesale electricity generation and trading business  which depends in large part on great bay and little bay s combined joint interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
accordingly  baycorp s results of operations significantly depend on the successful and continued operation of the seabrook project 
in particular  if the seabrook project experiences unscheduled outages of significant duration  baycorp s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
changes in the new england wholesale power market 
during recent years in new england  the combination of small increases in the demand for electricity and electric industry deregulation has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding the price of electricity in the wholesale power market 
although great bay s average selling price per kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased from cents in to cents in and to cents in  there can be no assurance that great bay or little bay will be able to sell their power at these prices or higher prices in the future 
risks in connection with joint ownership of seabrook project 
great bay and little bay are required under the joa to pay their share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including without limitation operations and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of seabrook unit s operations 
under certain circumstances  a failure by great bay or little bay to make their monthly payments under the joa entitles certain other joint owners of the seabrook project to purchase great bay or little bay s interest in the seabrook project for of the then fair market value thereof 
in addition  the failure to make monthly payments under the joa by owners of the seabrook project other than great bay and little bay may have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  great bay or little bay could opt to pay a greater proportion of the seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of their share of the seabrook project 
in the past  certain of the owners of the seabrook project other than great bay and little bay have not made their full respective payments 
the electric utility industry is undergoing significant changes as competition and deregulation are introduced into the marketplace 
some utilities  including certain participants  have indicated in state regulatory proceedings that they may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if regulators  as part of the industry restructuring  do not allow for full recovery of stranded costs 
if a participant other than great bay or little bay filed for bankruptcy and that participant was unable to pay its share of seabrook project expenses  great bay or little bay might opt to pay a greater portion of seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of their share of the seabrook project 
in the past  the filing of bankruptcy by a participant has not resulted in a failure to pay seabrook project expenses or an increase in the percentage of expenses paid by other participants 
the seabrook project is owned by great bay  little bay and the other owners thereof as tenants in common  with the various owners holding varying ownership shares 
this means that great bay and little bay  which together own only a interest  do not have control of the management of the seabrook project 
as a result  decisions may be made affecting the seabrook project notwithstanding great bay and or little bay s opposition 
certain costs and expenses of operating the seabrook project or owning an interest therein  such as certain insurance and decommissioning costs  are subject to increase or retroactive adjustment based on factors beyond the control of baycorp or its subsidiaries 
the cost of disposing of unit of the seabrook project is not known at this time 
these various costs and expenses may adversely affect baycorp  great bay and little bay  possibly materially 
risks associated with agreement to sell seabrook ownership interests 
on october   the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an agreement with northeast utilities nu under which great bay and little bay will join with nu in the sale of nu s ownership interests in the seabrook project 
under the terms of the agreement  baycorp will receive the sales price established by an auction process led by nu 
although the auction is expected to begin in the second quarter of with a closing expected the first half of  the company cannot control the procedure or timing of the joint sale of the seabrook project  and the sale may be delayed  abandoned or otherwise affected by factors beyond the company s control 
significantly  the price obtained by great bay and little bay in the sale of their seabrook interests cannot be predicted 
further  the value of the fuel and inventory owned by great bay and little bay  currently estimated at between million to million  may be materially different than estimated 
extensive government regulation 
the seabrook project is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 
in particular  the seabrook project  and great bay and little bay as part owners of a licensed nuclear facility  are subject to the broad jurisdiction of the nrc  which is empowered to authorize the siting  construction and operation of nuclear reactors after consideration of public health and safety  environmental and antitrust matters 
great bay and little bay are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  are required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
noncompliance with nrc requirements may result  among other things  in a shutdown of the seabrook project 
the nrc has promulgated a broad range of regulations affecting all aspects of the design  construction and operation of a nuclear facility  such as the seabrook project  including performance of nuclear safety systems  fire protection  emergency response planning and notification systems  insurance and quality assurance 
the nrc retains authority to modify  suspend or withdraw operating licenses  such as the license pursuant to which the seabrook project operates  at any time that conditions warrant 
for example  the nrc might order seabrook unit shut down i if flaws were discovered in the construction or operation of seabrook unit  ii if problems developed with respect to other nuclear generating plants of a design and construction similar to unit  or iii if accidents at other nuclear facilities suggested that nuclear generating plants generally were less safe than previously believed 
risk of nuclear accident 
nuclear reactors have been used to generate electric power for more than years and there are currently more than nuclear reactors used for electric power generation in the united states 
although the safety record of these nuclear reactors in the united states generally has been very good  accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere  including the well publicized incidents at three mile island in pennsylvania and chernobyl in the former soviet union 
the consequences of such an accident can be severe  including loss of life and property damage  and the available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay all the damages incurred 
waste disposal  decommissioning cost 
there has been considerable public concern and regulatory attention focused upon the disposal of low and high level nuclear wastes produced at nuclear facilities and the ultimate decommissioning of such facilities 
as to waste disposal concerns  both the federal government and the state of new hampshire are currently delinquent in the performance of their statutory obligations 
the joint owners of the seabrook project  through their managing agent naesco  entered into contracts with the doe for high level waste disposal in accordance with the nwpa 
under these contracts and the nwpa  the doe was required to take title to and dispose of the seabrook project s high level waste beginning no later than january  however  the doe has announced that its first high level waste repository will not be in operation until at the earliest 
the seabrook project increased its on site storage capacity for low level waste llw in and that capacity is expected to be sufficient to meet the project s storage requirements through in addition  the managing agent of the seabrook project has advised the joint owners that the seabrook project has adequate on site storage capacity for high level waste until approximately if the seabrook project were unable to store nuclear waste on site or make other disposal provisions  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
see business wholesale electricity generation and trading business nuclear waste disposal 
as to decommissioning  nrc regulations require that upon permanent shutdown of a nuclear facility  appropriate arrangements for full decontamination and decommissioning of the facility be made 
these regulations require that during the operation of a facility  the owners of the facility must set aside sufficient funds to defray decommissioning costs 
while the owners of the seabrook project are accumulating monies in a trust fund to defray decommissioning costs  these costs could substantially exceed the value of the trust fund  and the owners including great bay and little bay would remain liable for the excess 
moreover  the amount that is required to be deposited in the trust fund is subject to periodic review and adjustment by an independent commission of the state of new hampshire  which could result in material increases in such amounts 
factors related to houstonstreet need for additional financing 
based on current levels of operations and planned growth  houstonstreet s management anticipates that the net proceeds from sales of its stock and other securities  from commitments for further cash investments based on houstonstreet s meeting certain performance goals and from cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet houstonstreet s needs through december if houstonstreet is unable to close the sale of its series c units  requires additional funding or determines that it is appropriate to raise additional funding  houstonstreet may be unable to raise additional funds 
further  any such funding may result in significant dilution to existing houstonstreet stockholders  including baycorp 
the inability to obtain sufficient funds from operations and external sources when needed would have a material adverse effect on houstonstreet s business  results of operations and financial condition 
limited operating history 
houstonstreet was incorporated in delaware on april  houstonstreet initially launched its online electricity trading platform in the northeast on july  and nationwide on september  houstonstreet launched its online oil trading floor on may  houstonstreet has only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate its performance 
significant future losses expected 
houstonstreet s business is subject to the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly enterprises in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as electronic trading of energy products over the internet 
houstonstreet s substantial operating expenses and capital expenditures from formation to date have greatly exceeded its revenues over the same period 
houstonstreet expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses until later in however  there is no assurance that houstonstreet will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in or thereafter 
internet based wholesale energy trading is a new and evolving market 
wholesale trading of energy products over the internet is a new and rapidly evolving market 
houstonstreet cannot be certain that a viable market will emerge or be sustainable 
if the market for internet based wholesale energy trading fails to develop  if it develops more slowly than expected  if it becomes saturated with competitors or if it does not achieve widespread market acceptance  houstonstreet would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on internet based wholesale energy trading 
substantially all of houstonstreet s revenues depend on the continued and expanded use of internet based wholesale energy trading platforms 
houstonstreet currently depends on its wholesale crude and refined oil trading platform for substantially all of its current revenues 
during  approximately of houstonstreet s revenue consisted of commission on wholesale electricity trading and the other of houstonstreet s revenue consisted of commissions on wholesale crude oil and refined products trading 
from january  to march   nearly all of houstonstreet s revenue was generated by commissions on wholesale crude and refined products 
houstonstreet will likely depend on other energy trading platforms  including platforms for natural gas trading  if planned expansion is successful 
businesses have only recently begun significant use of the internet for electronic commerce 
although internet usage has grown dramatically  houstonstreet cannot assure you that usage will continue to increase for commerce or trading wholesale energy products 
a decrease in the use of the internet or a reduction in the currently anticipated growth in the use of the internet would have a material adverse effect on houstonstreet 
businesses may reject the internet as a viable commercial medium for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate network infrastructure  slow development of enabling technologies  insufficient commercial support or privacy concerns 
the internet s infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by increased usage 
in addition  delays in developing or adopting new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased government regulation  could cause the internet to lose its viability as a commercial medium 
dependence on trading liquidity 
houstonstreet will need to achieve trading liquidity on its internet based wholesale energy trading exchange in order to increase and sustain revenues 
if the volume and level of trades on the exchange do not increase  houstonstreet will not achieve profitability 
if houstonstreet fails to register additional users or generate increased traffic on its web site  the number of trades completed on the exchange may not increase 
if the number  size and frequency of transactions do not increase  houstonstreet will be unable to increase its revenues and houstonstreet s business will not achieve profitability 
dependence on increased business from unaffiliated customers 
if houstonstreet fails to grow its customer base or generate repeat and expanded business from customers that are not affiliated with houstonstreet  houstonstreet will be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
during  equiva trading company  the oil trading alliance of shell oil company  texaco and saudi aramco  was a party to of all crude and refined oil trades on houstonstreet 
in addition  sithe energies  inc was a party to of all electricity trades on houstonstreet 
houstonstreet earns standard commissions from all trades on houstonstreet  including trades by equiva trading company and sithe energies  inc and its counterparties 
equiva trading company and sithe energies  inc have made private investments in houstonstreet and are holders of houstonstreet capital stock 
to date  a substantial majority of houstonstreet s revenue has been derived from commissions from trades involving affiliated parties and their counterparties 
houstonstreet s management expects that commissions from trades involving affiliated parties and their counterparties will be a less significant portion of revenue in the future as the number of registered traders and the volume of trades increases 
if trading volume does not increase as anticipated  houstonstreet s revenue will not increase and houstonstreet s business and financial results will be materially adversely affected 
reliance on strategic relationships 
houstonstreet may be unable to implement its strategic growth plans without successfully identifying  forming  maintaining and enhancing strategic relationships  such as its strategic relationship with equiva 
houstonstreet s ability to achieve significant future revenue growth will depend in part on adding new strategic partners 
if houstonstreet is unable to form or successfully develop additional strategic relationships  houstonstreet may be unable to grow its revenues and houstonstreet could be materially adversely affected 
international expansion 
houstonstreet currently has foreign subsidiary offices located in amsterdam and london 
houstonstreet expects to continue expanding its international presence 
if houstonstreet is unable to expand its international presence further  houstonstreet may be unable to take advantage of the potential revenue associated with energy trading on a global level 
while houstonstreet s management believes that houstonstreet can become profitable if its services are widely adopted by power traders in the united states  the global energy market represents a much larger source of revenue 
to be successful  houstonstreet s management believes that houstonstreet must expand further its operations in international markets 
international operations subject houstonstreet to a number of risks that may increase houstonstreet s costs and require significant management attention 
these risks include difficulties and increased expenses associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  differing technology standards that may impede houstonstreet s ability to integrate its trading platforms across international borders  reluctance or inability of energy traders abroad to accept internet based wholesale energy trading as a method of conducting business  changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings 
regulatory risks and privacy concerns 
as use of the internet evolves  federal  state and foreign agencies could adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  government regulations could limit the market for houstonstreet s services 
in order to use houstonstreet s trading exchange  traders must first register with houstonstreet 
the registration process requires that users provide certain information about themselves and the companies for which they trade 
although houstonstreet collects this data only with the consent of a visitor  privacy concerns may cause visitors to resist registering to use the exchange 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten privacy concerns 
other countries and political entities  such as the european economic community  have adopted legislation or regulatory requirements relating to privacy 
the united states may adopt similar legislation or regulatory requirements 
if privacy legislation is enacted or privacy concerns are not adequately addressed  houstonstreet s business could be materially adversely affected 
unpredictability of future revenues  potential fluctuation in quarterly operating results 
as a result of houstonstreet s limited operating history and the emerging nature of the market for internet based trading of wholesale energy products  houstonstreet is unable to forecast its revenues accurately 
houstonstreet expects to experience significant fluctuations in its future quarterly operating results due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside houstonstreet s control 
these factors include the demand for houstonstreet s trading services  the introduction and market acceptance of new services in the industry  reductions in trading commissions or changes in how services are priced  and the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to expanding houstonstreet s business  operations and infrastructure 
quarterly results also can be affected by changes in the use of the internet and electronic commerce  changes in governmental regulations  and changes in general economic conditions and economic conditions specifically related to the internet and energy trading markets 
in addition  trading volumes can fluctuate due to the seasonal nature of the wholesale electricity trading market 
typically  there are substantial declines in the volume of wholesale electricity trading during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
houstonstreet s management believes that fourth quarter trading can be adversely affected by seasonal trading patterns  the inclination of some utilities  independent power producers and power marketers to maintain existing trading positions near year end and other factors 
it is difficult to forecast the effect such factors  or the combination of any of these factors  would have on houstonstreet s results of operations for any given fiscal quarter 
houstonstreet s management believes that houstonstreet s quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
system maintenance and protection 
unanticipated problems at the third party facility that houses substantially all of houstonstreet s computer and communications hardware systems could cause interruptions or delays in houstonstreet s business  loss of data or render houstonstreet unable to process wholesale energy trades 
any such interruptions or delays at the facility would harm houstonstreet s revenue and results of operations 
in addition  these third party systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from intentional malicious acts  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquake and similar events 
houstonstreet does not carry business interruption insurance 
in addition  the failure by the third party facility to provide the data communications capacity required by houstonstreet  as a result of human error  natural disaster or other operational disruptions  could result in interruptions in houstonstreet s service 
the occurrence of any or all of these events could harm houstonstreet s reputation and brand and business 
traders on the houstonstreet 
com may also be harmed by any system or equipment failures experienced by houstonstreet 
in that event  houstonstreet s relationship with these traders may be adversely affected  houstonstreet may lose traders  houstonstreet s ability to attract new users may be adversely affected and houstonstreet could be exposed to liability 
if users of houstonstreet s trading platform suffer similar interruptions in their operations  for any of the reasons discussed above or for other reasons  houstonstreet s business could also be adversely affected 
in addition  if traders computer systems suffer interruptions  the link to houstonstreet s web site could be severed and the traders wholesale energy trades could be delayed or stopped 
rapid technological change 
to remain competitive  houstonstreet must continue to enhance and improve its services 
the internet is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices 
houstonstreet s success will depend  in part  on its ability to develop leading internet based technologies useful for wholesale energy trading  enhance its existing services  develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of wholesale energy traders  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
houstonstreet would be materially adversely affected if it is unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements 
intense competition 
wholesale energy trading markets are dynamic and intensely competitive 
competition is likely to increase in the future as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their products and services 
see business internet based energy trading and information business competition 
many of these potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including larger technical  production and marketing staffs  a more established presence in the wholesale energy trading community  greater brand recognition  and substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
if houstonstreet does not compete effectively or if it experiences pricing pressures  reduced margins or loss of market share resulting from increased competition  houstonstreet s business would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on management and key employees 
houstonstreet is  and for the foreseeable future will be  dependent upon the services of its directors  executive officers and key employees 
houstonstreet s future success depends on its ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  sales and customer service personnel 
the loss of the services of current key personnel and the failure to hire new personnel could have a material adverse effect upon houstonstreet s results of operations  product development efforts and ability to grow 
in  each of baycorp and houstonstreet entered into a new employment agreement with frank w 
getman jr 
mr 
getman serves as the president and chief executive officer of each company and is separately compensated by each company 
although houstonstreet purchased key man term life insurance on the life of frank w 
getman jr 
in  houstonstreet does not plan to purchase life insurance on the lives of any of its other key personnel 
management of growth 
in  houstonstreet experienced significant growth in its business operations 
this growth placed a substantial strain on houstonstreet s resources 
houstonstreet s need to manage its growth successfully will require it to implement appropriate operational  financial  accounting and management information systems and controls 
houstonstreet s failure to manage its growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on houstonstreet 
protection of proprietary rights 
houstonstreet s ability to compete depends significantly on the proprietary nature of its web site technology as well as its patent applications 
houstonstreet has filed three patent applications to date 
houstonstreet seeks to protect its proprietary rights through a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that a third party will not misappropriate or otherwise obtain access to houstonstreet s proprietary technology or develop similar technology independently 
competitors may also be able to circumvent any patents that houstonstreet obtains 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
houstonstreet could incur substantial costs to prosecute or defend any intellectual property litigation 
if houstonstreet litigated to enforce its rights  it would be expensive  would divert management resources and may not be adequate to prevent the use of its intellectual property by third parties 
potential intellectual property infringement 
while houstonstreet currently is not aware that it infringes any other patents  it is possible that houstonstreet s technology infringes patents held by third parties 
if houstonstreet were to be found infringing  the owner of the patent could sue houstonstreet for damages  prevent houstonstreet from making  selling or using the owner s patented technology or could impose substantial royalty fees for those privileges
