in connection with the acquisition of human code  we assumed the outstanding options granted under the human code stock option stock issuance plan 
prior to the acquisition  options to purchase approximately  shares of human code common stock were outstanding at exercise prices between and per share 
as a result of the acquisition  we replaced the outstanding human code stock options with options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the options will vest ratably over periods up to four years 
we recorded deferred compensation of million related to the intrinsic value of the unvested options 
stock based compensation expense  relating to these options  was approximately million for the year ended december  the deferred compensation will be charged to operations at the rate of approximately million per quarter for the next six quarters  and million in total thereafter  spread over approximately eight quarters 
in connection with the acquisition of adjacency  we assumed the outstanding options granted under the adjacency stock option plan the adjacency plan 
the adjacency plan was originally adopted by adjacency in and provided for the grant of stock options for up to an aggregate of  shares of class b common stock of adjacency 
in november  prior to the acquisition  adjacency had granted a total of  options to its employees at exercise prices between and per share 
the shares vested ratably over three years starting on the date of employment  except for certain employees who were granted accelerated vesting upon a change in control of adjacency 
the total compensation charge to be taken over the vesting period is approximately million  resulting from the fact that the options were granted at below fair market value 
the charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million was the result of certain employees being substantially vested by december  a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of was the result of the change in control provisions 
we expect this charge to be approximately  per quarter for the next three quarters 
stock based compensation expense  relating to these options  was approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the acquisition  we have assumed the obligations related to options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
no further grants may be made pursuant to the adjacency plan 
previously outstanding options under the adjacency plan remain outstanding  and are exercisable for shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acquisition of studio archetype in the third quarter of  the company allocated million to in process technology and recorded a corresponding income tax benefit of million 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value of such technology based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the development of projects that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition and with respect to which the in process research and development had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  this allocation was charged to expense as of the acquisition date 
the company allocated values to the acquired in process research and development projects by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of studio archetype s next generation enterprise wide suite of development  scheduling  bug tracking and content management applications 
the integrated solution is composed of the following technologies content management systems cms  an intranet  an extranet  an issues server and an on line user interface lab ui lab  which together allow developers and clients to access prototypes and trial deliverables and fully integrate user interface tools with client server  advanced database and legacy systems 
the cms  intranet and extranet components of the system were released in june the ui lab was completed in march and the issue server was completed in september the integrated solution is a comprehensive enterprise scale system 
all components of the in process r d project acquired by us with the acquisition of studio archetype were rolled out as an integrated  enterprise wide solution in at the time of the acquisition  expenditures on these projects were approximately million  and estimated costs to complete these projects were expected to total approximately  the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products and services principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the efforts to develop the purchased in process technology also included testing of the technology for compatibility and interoperability with other applications 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting them to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by studio archetype and its competitors 
we did not experience any material variations in costs to complete or completion dates from our initial assumptions 
following the acquisition of studio archetype  studio archetype was fully integrated into our operations  making the isolation of specific revenues attributable to the in process technologies difficult 
however  nothing has occurred to materially change our expectations with respect to the underlying assumptions used in projecting the expected future revenues associated with this in process r d 
the rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to percent were used for the business enterprise and for the in process research and development 
the company believes that these discount rates were commensurate with studio archetype s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of future technological advances at that time 
results of operations overview our revenue is derived from business and technology consulting services 
although we have historically experienced growth in our revenues  the market for advanced technology consulting skills has declined significantly over the last several months 
as a result of this decline  our revenues for the three months ended december  increased less than from our revenues for the three months ended september   and our net earnings decreased approximately over the same period 
we expect to experience a further decline in our revenues and earnings for the quarter ended march   which could continue into future quarters 
as of december   we had  full time employees  composed of  project personnel  employees in general and administration and employees in sales and marketing 
as a result of a reduction in our work force which was announced in march  we had  full time employees as of march   composed of  project personnel  employees in general and administration and employees in sales and marketing 
we expect to take a restructuring charge in the first quarter of of approximately to million  which will consist of severance and related expenses from the reduction in workforce  and other charges related to the sydney office closing and office space consolidation elsewhere 
the company expects cost savings from these actions of approximately million in the first quarter of  and to million on an annualized basis

these costs represent the most significant expense we incur in providing our services 
the increase in project personnel costs for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the number of project personnel from  at december  to  at december  and to higher compensation for project personnel 
project personnel costs increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in due to lower billable utilization of project personnel 
project personnel costs increased as a percentage of revenues from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of this was due primarily to a decline in revenue growth in the fourth quarter resulting in lower employee utilization

the options vest ratably over periods up to four years

in connection with the tlg acquisition  we will issue million of restricted sapient common stock 
we will amortize the million of restricted stock over the vesting period of years commencing on the date of acquisition

prior to our acquisition of adjacency in march  adjacency granted stock options at below fair market value 
the options were granted in november of with a three year vesting schedule commencing on the date of employment

we expect the effective tax rates to be higher than the statutory rates in the future due to the non deductible amortization charges 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on our future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions

borrowings under this line of credit  which expires on june   bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit includes covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limits the payment of dividends 
at december   we had no bank borrowings outstanding  letters of credit of million were outstanding under the agreement 
there were no material capital commitments at december  we invest predominantly in instruments that are highly liquid  investment grade securities and have maturities of less than one year 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  this resulted primarily from net income of million  net non cash charges of million  increases in accrued expenses and accrued compensation of million  increases in accrued income taxes payable of million  decreases in unbilled revenues on contracts of million and increases in other long term liabilities of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and increases of million in prepaid expenses and other current and non current assets  all of which were principally related to the overall growth of the company

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement was amended by the issuance of sfas  deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which changed the effective date of sfas to all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if so  the type of hedge transaction 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
