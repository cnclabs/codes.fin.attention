increases in other income also contributed to the higher net income in net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid for the liabilities used to support those assets 
it is the largest component of the company s earnings and changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on net income 
variations in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and their relative sensitivity to interest rate movements determine changes in net interest income 
during the company recorded net interest income of million  a increase from the net interest income of million 
this is compared to net interest income of million for the increase in net interest income in is directly related to the increase in the average earning assets and interest bearing liability volume of the bank of and  respectively  offset somewhat by the basis point decrease in net interest margin during the year 
net interest income increased in related to the higher average loan and interest bearing deposit volume of the bank which was up from by and  respectively  combined with the overall reduction in the cost of funds in for the year ended december   the company s net interest margin was  compared to in and for the net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the margin for decreased basis points from the prior year due primarily to the higher cost of funds related to the general rise in interest rates during and promotions offered on certificates of deposit cds during the year 
the margins between and increased basis points due to the reduction in the cost of funds as cds with higher rates matured and were replaced with lower market rate deposits during the declining rate period between late and mid year interest income interest income for was million  which was a million or increase over the million for interest income for was million 
the increases each year are primarily a result of the higher levels of earning assets which averaged million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes in average yield on earning assets also affect the interest income reported each year 
the average yield  on a fully tax equivalent basis  decreased from in to in  and increased to in due to fluctuations in the general interest rate environment during the three year period 
the majority of the increase in average earning assets between and and between and was in loans  which are the company s highest yielding assets that accounted for of average earning assets for the year ended consolidated loans averaged million in with an average yield of  compared to million in with an average yield of  and million in with an average yield of

the reduction in the interest expense in from was a result of the increase in average interest bearing liabilities being more than offset by the basis point reduction in the cost of funds 
the higher average cost of funds in was primarily a result of the maturity of cds renewed at higher current market rates as the prime rate increased in the latter half of and into  combined with promotional rates offered on cds during interest bearing liabilities averaged million in with an average rate of  compared to million in with an average rate of  and an average of million with an average rate of during average yields and rates for the years ended december  on a fully tax equivalent basis earning assets loans securities short term investments total earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits short term borrowings fhlb advances total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin average prime interest rate provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in   in  and  in the change in the provision each year was directly related to the level of net originations in each year as follows million in  million in  and million in other factors influencing the amount charged to the provision each year is the total amount of past due and classified loans and the total outstanding loans and charge off activity of the finance company  which have higher inherent risk than do loans of the bank 
estimates charged to the provision for loan losses are based on management s judgment as to the amount required to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio and are adjusted as necessary 
noninterest income and expenses noninterest income increased  or  to million in from million in and million in credit card fees and income  the largest single item in noninterest income  rose to  in from  in and  in the increase is related to the higher volume of transactions and merchant activity in the bank s credit card portfolio each year

loans the loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial loans  commercial loans secured by real estate  loans secured by one to four family residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
substantially all of these loans are located in the upstate of south carolina and are concentrated in the company s market area 
at december   the company had no loans for highly leveraged transactions and no foreign loans 
the bank s primary focus has been on commercial lending to small and medium sized businesses in its marketplace 
commercial loans are spread throughout a variety of industries  with no industry or group of related industries accounting for a significant portion of the commercial loan portfolio 
as of december   the company had total loans outstanding  net of unearned income  of million which represents an increase of million or from the outstanding loans of million 
outstanding loans represent the largest component of earning assets at of average earning assets for compared to for gross loans were and  respectively  of total assets at december  and the increase in loans between and is attributable to internal growth and the bank s expansion into a new market during as the company did not purchase any loans during the year 
freedom s outstanding loans  net of unearned income  totaled million  or of consolidated loans at december  this is compared to million or of consolidated loans at december  for  the company s loans averaged million with a yield of 
this is compared to million average loans with a yield of in the increase in the loan yield reflects the general increasing rate environment experienced through the interest rates charged on loans of the bank vary with the degree of risk  maturity and amount of the loan 
competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government policy and regulations also influence interest rates 
loans of the finance company are regulated under state laws which establish the maximum loan amounts and interest rates  and the types and maximum amounts of fees  insurance premiums  and other costs that may be charged 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loan losses and recoveries are charged or credited directly to the allowance 
the amount charged to the provision for loan losses by the bank and the finance company is based on management s judgment as to the amounts required to maintain an adequate allowance 
the level of this allowance is dependent upon growth in the loan portfolios  the total amount of past due loans  nonperforming loans  and known loan deteriorations and or concentrations of credit 
other factors affecting the allowance are trends in portfolio volume  maturity and composition  collateral values  and general economic conditions 
finally  management s assessment of probable losses based upon internal credit grading of the loans and periodic reviews and assessments of credit risk associated with particular loans is considered in establishing the allowance amount 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses which it believes adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  management s judgment is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
there are risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management uses the best information available to make evaluations  however  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making evaluations 
the company is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to the adequacy of the allowance  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance in comparison to a group of peer companies identified by the regulatory agencies 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans at the end of this is compared to a million allowance or of total loans at december  for the year ended december   the company reported net charge offs of  or of consolidated average loans 
this is compared to consolidated net charge offs of  or of average loans for the year ended december  loans past due days and greater totaled  or of gross loans at december  compared to  or of gross loans at december  loans on non accrual totaled  and  respectively  at december  and generally  loans of the bank are placed on non accrual status at the earlier of when they are days past due or when the collection of the loan becomes doubtful 
loans of the finance company are not classified as non accrual  but are charged off when such become days contractually past due or earlier if the loan is deemed uncollectible 
at december  and  the bank held no other real estate owned acquired in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans 
at december   loans considered to be impaired under statement of financial accounting standards totaled million  which includes the  non accrual loan 
there were no impaired loans at december  interest bearing liabilities during  interest bearing liabilities averaged million with an average rate of compared to million with an average rate of in the increase in the average rate reflects the general increasing rate environment experienced throughout in pricing deposits  the company considers its liquidity needs  the direction and levels of interest rates and local market conditions 
at december   interest bearing deposits comprised approximately of total deposits and of interest bearing liabilities 
the remainder of interest bearing liabilities consists principally of federal home loan bank advances 
the company uses its deposit base as a primary source with which to fund earning assets 
deposits increased from million at december  to million as of year end the increase was primarily in the non interest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts and time deposits greater than  noninterest bearing deposits  which increased during the year  averaged of total deposits for the year compared to in the company s core deposit base consists of consumer and commercial money market accounts  checking accounts  savings and retirement accounts  now accounts  and non jumbo time deposits less than 
although such core deposits continue to be interest sensitive for both the company and the industry as a whole  these deposits continue to provide the company with a large and stable source of funds 
the company closely monitors its reliance on certificates of deposit greater than  which are generally considered less stable and more interest rate sensitive than core deposits 
certificates of deposit in excess of  represented and  respectively  of total deposits at december  and the company has no brokered deposits 
capital resources total shareholders equity amounted to million  or of total assets  at december  this is compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the million increase in total shareholders equity resulted principally from retention of earnings and stock issued pursuant to the company s stock option plans  combined with the decrease in unrealized loss on investments available for sale 
book value per share at december  and was and  respectively 
on november   the company issued its ninth stock dividend to shareholders of record as of november  this dividend resulted in the issuance of approximately  shares of the company s par value common stock 
all weighted average share and per share data has been restated to reflect all stock dividends 
to date  the capital needs of the company have been met through the retention of earnings and from the proceeds of its initial offering of common stock 
the company believes that the rate of asset growth will not negatively impact the capital base 
the company has no commitments or immediate plans for any significant capital expenditures outside of the normal course of business 
the company s management does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in the company s capital resources materially increasing or decreasing 
the following table sets forth various capital ratios for the company and the bank at december  and the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
at december  and  the company and the bank were in compliance with each of the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
the bank exceeded the well capitalized standard under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
capital summary the company the bank as of as of as of as of total risk based capital tier risk based capital leverage capital liquidity liquidity management involves meeting the cash flow requirements of the company 
the company must maintain an adequate liquidity position in order to respond to the short term demand for funds caused by withdrawals from deposit accounts  maturities of other borrowings  extensions of credit  and for the payment of operating expenses 
maintaining an adequate level of liquidity is accomplished through a combination of liquid assets  those which can easily be converted into cash  and access to additional sources of funds 
the company s primary liquid assets are cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  unpledged investment securities available for sale  other short term investments and maturing loans 
these primary liquidity sources accounted for and of average assets for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
in management s opinion  the company maintains adequate levels of liquidity by retaining sufficient liquid assets and assets which can be easily converted into cash and by maintaining access to various sources of funds 
the primary sources of funds available through the bank include advances from the federal home loan bank  purchasing federal funds from other financial institutions  lines of credit through the federal reserve bank  and increasing deposits by raising rates paid 
summit financial corporation summit financial  the parent holding company  has limited liquidity needs 
summit financial requires liquidity to pay limited operating expenses and to provide funding to its consumer finance subsidiary  freedom finance 
summit financial has approximately million in available liquidity remaining from its initial public offering and the retention of earnings 
a total of million of this liquidity was advanced to the finance company to fund its operations as of december  summit financial also has an available line of credit totaling million with an unaffiliated financial institution  all of which was available at december  further sources of liquidity for summit financial include borrowings from individuals  and management fees and debt service which are paid by its subsidiary on a monthly basis 
liquidity needs of freedom finance  primarily for the funding of loan originations  paying operating expenses  and servicing debt  have been met to date through the initial capital investment of  made by summit financial  borrowings from an unrelated private investor  and line of credit facilities provided by summit financial and summit national bank 
the company s management believes its liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs and does not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse affect on the company s liquidity position 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars  without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
unlike most other industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect in a financial institution s performance than does the effect of inflation 
the yield on a majority of the company s earning assets adjusts simultaneously with changes in the general level of interest rates 
approximately of the company s liabilities at december  had been issued with fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity 
during periods of rising interest rates  as experienced through  the company s assets reprice faster than the supporting liabilities 
this causes an increase in the net interest margin until the fixed rate deposits mature and are repriced at then higher current market rates  thus narrowing the difference between what the company earns on its assets and what it pays on its liabilities 
given the company s current balance sheet structure  the opposite effect that is  a decrease in net interest income is realized in a falling rate environment 
accounting  reporting and regulatory matters in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes  for the first time  comprehensive accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for accounting purposes  sfas comprehensively defines a derivative instrument 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for the gain or loss due to change in fair value of the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge  the gains or losses are reported in earnings when they occur 
however  if the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge  the accounting varies based on the type of risk being hedged 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of sfas  delayed the effective date of this statement for one year 
sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of statement no 
 addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for entities that apply sfas sfas applies to all entities and is effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  the company adopted sfas effective january  with no material impact on its financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity achieving consistent growth in net interest income  which is affected by fluctuations in interest rates  is the primary goal of the company s asset liability function 
the company attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings and to achieve consistent growth in net interest income  while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the company s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the company s asset liability committee alco uses a simulation model  among other techniques  to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account  over a month period or longer if necessary  interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the company s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios and rate shocks 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated as necessary throughout the year in order to maintain a current forecast as assumptions change 
according to the model  the company is presently positioned so that net interest income will increase slightly if interest rates rise in the near term and will decrease slightly if interest rates decline in the near term 
the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship between the maturity and repricing of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period 
the static interest sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is also reviewed periodically to provide insights related to static repricing structure of assets and liabilities 
at december   on a cumulative basis through months  rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  resulting in a month period liability sensitive position of approximately  when the effective change ratio the historical relative movement of each asset s and liability s rates in relation to a basis point change in the prime rate is applied to the interest gap position  the company is actually in an asset sensitive position over a month period and the entire repricing lives of the assets and liabilities 
this is primarily due to the fact that approximately of the loan portfolio moves immediately on a one to one ratio with a change in the prime rate  while the deposit accounts do not increase or decrease as much relative to a prime rate movement 
the company s asset sensitive position means that assets reprice faster than the liabilities  which generally results in increases in the net interest income during periods of rising rates and decreases in net interest income when market rates decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  investing  deposit gathering and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  including credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and it could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
the bank s alco monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items over a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
a primary purpose of the company s asset and liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a periodic basis by the board of directors and the alco which is charged with the responsibility to maintain the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value within board approved limits 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
the company s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum allowable decreases in npv in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels as of year end 
at december   the company s estimated changes in npv were within the limits established by the board 
market value of portfolio policy equity percent change in interest rates limit s change basis point rise  basis point rise  basis point rise  no change  basis point decline  basis point decline  basis point decline
