revenues our revenues are derived from the sale of software products and related services including subscription contracts 
total revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing year to year increases of between and and between and we had no customers that accounted for more than of our revenues in   or revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in the united kingdom and europe  represented approximately  and in  and  respectively 
licenses 
license revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in license revenues over these periods is a result of continued market acceptance of the bv control product family and revenues generated from new product introductions 
services 
service revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in our service revenues over these periods is a result of an increase in purchases and renewals of subscription contracts by our growing installed customer base as well as increased revenue from professional services activities 
because we recognize revenues from subscription contracts ratably over the contract term  this increase in these revenues as a percentage of total revenues results in greater deferred revenue balances 
however  we recognize the costs associated with these services as they are incurred 
as revenues from professional services are recognized when the services have been completed  quarter to quarter service revenue could fluctuate materially as larger service contracts are completed 
cost of revenues cost of licenses 
cost of licenses includes product manuals  packaging  distribution and media costs for our software products 
cost of licenses were million  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively  with each year representing approximately to of license revenues 
the cost of licenses increased primarily due to increases in product shipments and the cost of product packaging and documentation 
we believe these costs will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue  although there will continue to be quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of certain expenses 
cost of services 
cost of services includes personnel and other costs related to technical support and professional services 
cost of services were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of service revenues in the respective periods 
the cost of services has increased primarily due to increases in the cost of technical support staff providing support to our growing customer base and increases in the cost of professional services staff providing customer training and customization services 
we believe the services gross margin  as a percentage of service revenues in the foreseeable future will remain relatively consistent with services gross margins realized in professional service revenues generally result in a lower gross margin than other types of revenues 
if professional service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues  our overall gross margin may be adversely affected 
costs and expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  general office expenses  travel and entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the absolute dollar cost of sales and marketing expenses is related to the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the building of our telesales and field sales force and the additional facilities and computer systems required by these additional personnel 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is related to our efforts to recruit  train  and deploy sales representatives with a higher level of experience  and thus with a higher associated compensation level  our attempt to increase the ratio of sales related software engineers to sales representatives  and the incurrence of more travel and remote deployment of sales representatives in an effort to secure larger orders 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is related to the reduction of duplicative marketing efforts associated with netect over these periods  the start up costs incurred with the launch of our direct telesales organization in germany and france in and our ongoing efforts to manage operating expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for product development  product management and quality assurance personnel  payments to contract programmers and expendable equipment purchases 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the absolute dollar cost of research and development expenses is related to increased personnel  additional facilities and an increase in the computer systems and software development tools required by the additional personnel 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is related to the ramp up of research and development expenses for new product lines requiring additional research and development effort relative to the respective license revenue generated by these products in the periods 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is related to the reduction in development expenses related to netect s worldwide development operations 
we believe that a significant research and development investment is essential for it to maintain and grow our market position and continue to expand our product lines 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to product research 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  personnel and related costs for the company s executive  administrative  finance and information services staff 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing  and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increase in the general and administrative expenses is related to the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts over this period and increased staffing  facilities costs and associated expenses necessary to manage and support our increased scale of operations 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is related to the reduction of duplicative administrative expenses associated with netect over these periods 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is a result of duplicative staff associated with the entevo acquisition and the increase in staff to support our growing scale of worldwide operations 
acquisition related earnout at december   we were obligated to make an earnout payment of million to certain former owners of curasoft  based on the achievement of revenue targets related to an existing product  as well as their continued employment with us 
we are not obligated to any other future earnout payments related to this acquisition 
merger and restructuring expenses product realignment restructuring in december  we realigned our product offerings and strategic plans for product development 
as a result  management determined certain capitalized software costs  prepaid royalties and equipment were impaired as of december  we recognized an impairment charge totaling  in connection with this product realignment  which has been included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
in connection with this product realignment  management approved restructuring plans to eliminate certain management and staff positions and to close the operations in freemont  california 
the restructuring plans were based on management s best estimate of those costs based on the information available at that time 
the restructuring expenses related to this plan include involuntary employee separation expenses for employees and other miscellaneous restructuring expenses 
the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december  were as follows beginning cash accrueds at accrual expenditures december  employee severance other restructuring costs total acquisition of entevo corporation on february  we merged with entevo corporation entevo in a stock for stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
entevo provided directory management solutions that help organizations deploy  integrate  administer and maintain enterprise directory services  in windows nt and windows environments 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of common stock 
we incurred transaction costs of  and restructuring costs of  as a result of this merger 
the historical financial data included herein has been restated to reflect the merger with entevo by combining our historical results and entevo s for all periods presented 
there were no material transactions between entevo and us during the periods prior to the merger 
at the time of the merger  management approved restructuring plans to eliminate duplicate positions and integrate entevo s and bindview s worldwide operations 
the restructuring plans were based on management s best estimate of those costs based on the information available at that time 
the restructuring expenses related to this plan include involuntary employee separation and relocation expenses  contract cancellation provisions  product reorganization  integration related expenses and other miscellaneous restructuring expenses 
the transaction costs related to the acquisition include investment banking fees of  professional expenses of  product due diligence and transfer fees of  and other miscellaneous transaction expenses of we believe the actions under the plan are complete 
the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december   were as follows beginning cash accrued expenses at accrual expenditures december  employee severance and relocation costs   elimination of duplicative operating expense product reorganization integration and other restructuring costs total   acquisition of netect  ltd on march   we merged with netect  ltd 
netect in a stock for stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
netect developed and marketed corporate security solutions for internet intranet networks 
in connection with the merger  we issued  shares of common stock 
we incurred transaction costs of  and restructuring costs of as a result of this merger 
the historical financial data included herein has been restated to reflect the merger with netect by combining our historical results and netect s for all periods presented 
there were no material transactions between netect and us during the periods prior to the merger 
at the time of the merger  management approved restructuring plans to eliminate duplicate senior management positions and to close the israeli operations of netect 
the restructuring plans were based on management s best estimate of those costs based on the information available at that time 
the restructuring expenses related to this plan include involuntary employee separation expenses for approximately former netect employees  the costs to close netect s israeli operations and other miscellaneous restructuring expenses 
the restructuring expense adjustment was recognized in the second quarter of and relates to additional costs to close netect s israeli operations that exceeded management s initial estimate 
we have completed the actions related to the restructuring plans 
the transaction costs related to the acquisition include investment banking fees of  accounting and legal expenses of  transfer fees of  and other miscellaneous transaction expenses of the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december   were as follows beginning cash accrued expenses at accrual expenditures adjustment december  employee severance and related costs israeli office closing other restructuring costs total purchased in process research and development in december  we committed to deliver shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interests in curasoft  inc in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
these shares were issued in the first quarter of the purchase price allocation resulted in an immediate write off of approximately million in for purchased in process research and development costs related to a curasoft product curaslam undergoing development at the time of the acquisition 
curaslam has been designed as a stand alone product by curasoft and is not related to the curasoft enr product family 
this product is currently being designed to enable customers to improve the service levels of their computing environments and will help customers better align business processes with their it functions 
we determined that the purchased in process technology had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use based on the status of design and development activities at the acquisition date 
to determine the fair value of the purchased in process research and development activities  we used values determined by an independent valuation firm  which applied the percentage of completion approach 
before the acquisition  curasoft conducted in depth market research  designed the product architecture  substantially completed the coding of the user interface and began the coding of the other modules 
we estimate that the development effort of this product was complete at the date of acquisition 
the percentage completed of was applied to the estimated fair value of the completed product to determine the in process research and development charge upon acquisition 
the estimated fair value of the completed product was determined using the future revenue streams expected from the product  net of related expenses  discounted at a rate based upon the specific level of risk associated with achieving the forecasted revenues 
we continued to develop this product and invested over million in the development costs associated with its operations in fremont  california during in december of  we determined that this product would not be complementary to its planned product offerings for as a result  we abandoned the development efforts on this product and therefore estimate no future revenues related to this product 
other income  net we had other income of million  million and million in fiscal  and this increase is primarily due to an increase in interest income related to higher investment balances and return rates during provision for income taxes our historical restated results related to the acquisition of netect in march and entevo in february do not recognize a tax benefit for certain net operating losses generated by netect and entevo because our ability to realize the net operating losses is limited 
these net operating losses are also subject to limitations under internal revenue code section the effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
valuation allowances booked on foreign net operating losses adversely impacted  and rates 
certain transaction expenses recorded in connection with our merger with netect and entevo are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and adversely impacted the and effective tax rates 
purchased in process research and development expenses recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of curasoft  inc are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and adversely impacted the rate 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately for liquidity and capital resources our working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments balance decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to the transaction and restructuring costs related to the acquisition of entevo  the purchase of our stock as part of the stock repurchase program  as well as investments in the operations of the business including  but not limited to  the purchase of property  equipment  leasehold improvements  and an increase in our accounts receivable balance as a result of increased amounts of large scale transactions to multinational corporations 
to provide immediate short term liquidity  should we need it  we maintain a million line of credit arrangement that is secured by cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
this facility expires on september   but we may renew it for up to four years 
any borrowings against this line will bear an interest rate of libor plus 
we are not obligated to pay any fees for the unused portion of this line 
to date  we have not borrowed against this line 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and a line of credit will be sufficient to meet our normal working capital requirements for at least the next months 
proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we believe that such measures afford only limited protection 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our copyrights and trade secrets 
we license our software products primarily under click through licenses agreements our click through license agreements are displayed to the user by the installation program s for our software  they require the user to signify assent to the agreement by taking action such as clicking on an i agree button 
click through license agreements are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees  and take effect upon the user s taking action required by the installation program 
we believe  however  that these measures afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that competition will not independently develop similar or superior technology 
we are not aware that we are infringing any proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to either license the infringed or similar technology or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
demand for our products softens in a weakened economy 
in a general economic downturn  our customers are apt to curtail it expenses 
this can result in lower sales  lower sales revenues and a lengthening of sales cycles during these periods 
further  in some cases  sales we have made and recorded could be unwound if customers decide not to keep a purchased license 
this circumstance is historically much more prevalent in an economic downturn than in more positive economic times 
specifically  in late january and february of  we experienced a substantial increase in product returns over historical returns as our customers curtailed it spending over concerns about a generally weakening economy 
if demand for our products decreases substantially  we might embark on certain cost cutting measures  which may include but are not limited to  employee reductions  office closings and product consolidations 
we may experience decreased sales or further increased customer returns in the future 
if we experience a decrease in demand for our products  we can t assure you that we will be able to cut costs quickly and effectively in response to decreased sales or increased returns 
our quarterly and annual revenues  expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly 
these fluctuations may be due to a number of factors  including demand for our products  size and timing of significant orders and their fulfillment  our ability to develop and upgrade our technology  changes in our level of operating expenses  our ability to compete in a highly competitive market  undetected software errors and other product quality problems  changes in our sales incentive plans and staffing of sales territories  and changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues and the level of international expansion 
absence of backlog 
generally  we do not operate with a backlog because we ship our products and recognize revenue shortly after orders are received 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop or statement of position no 
modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  as applicable 
as the company s sales transactions and product mix becomes more complex  revenue recognition under sop or sop could require the company to defer a significant portion of the total contract and recognize this deferred revenue in future periods 
intra quarter fluctuations 
orders booked throughout a quarter may substantially impact product revenues in that quarter 
our sales also fluctuate throughout the quarter as a result of customer buying patterns 
we generally record a significant portion for our revenue in the later portion of each quarter 
in addition  we base our expenses to a significant extent on our expectations of future revenues 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to reduce spending quickly if our revenues are lower than we had projected 
if our revenue levels do not meet our projections  we expect our operating results to be adversely and disproportionately affected 
fixed expenses 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our expectations of future revenues 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to reduce spending quickly if our revenues are lower than we had projected 
if our revenue levels do not meet our projections  we expect our operating results to be adversely and disproportionately affected 
seasonal fluctuations 
our quarterly operating results also are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations 
year end customer buying patterns and compensation policies based on annual revenue quotas have caused our revenues to be strongest in the fourth quarter of the year and to decrease in the first quarter of the following year 
in future periods  we expect that these seasonal trends may cause first quarter revenues to be significantly lower than the level achieved in the preceding fourth quarter 
however  first quarter revenues in any given fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of  and should not be used as a basis for prediction of higher revenues in any future quarter 
maintenance subscription revenues 
before january   we provided telephone support free of charge and sold product upgrades separately or through maintenance subscription contracts 
we now require our customers to purchase a maintenance subscription to receive product upgrades and technical support 
unlike software license revenues  which we generally recognize upon shipment of the product  we recognize maintenance subscription contract revenues ratably over the life of the contract term 
as a result  if we derive a larger percentage of our revenues from maintenance subscription contracts  we will experience an increase in deferred revenue that is likely to decrease our operating margins 
decreased operating margins may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
quarter to quarter comparisons 
we believe quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues  expenses and results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly revenues  expenses and results of operations to predict our future performance 
we have a limited operating history in certain respects 
we have extensive experience in developing  marketing  and supporting our flagship products  bv control for windows nt  bv control for netware  and bv control for nds formerly branded as nosadmin for windows nt and nosadmin for netware 
we have a more limited operating history with certain new and acquired products 
an investor in our company must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by software companies working with early stage products  particularly those faced by companies in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving systems management software market 
to compete in this market  we believe that we must devote substantial resources to expanding our sales and marketing organization and to continue product development 
as a result  we will need to recognize significant quarterly revenues to remain profitable 
our revenues have increased in recent years  and revenues for recent quarters have exceeded revenues for the same quarter for the prior year 
however  we cannot be certain that we can sustain these growth rates or that we will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our markets are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
our markets are highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we face competition from small companies with niche offerings as well as public companies with a breadth of offerings 
new competitors have arisen and can be expected to continue to arise in a rapidly evolving market 
currently  our products compete with products from the following organizations providers of security analysis and audit products  such as symantec inc  intrusion 
com  iss group  inc  pentasafe  inc  and network associates inc providers of stand alone inventory and asset management products  such as tally systems corp  providers of lan desktop management suites  such as intel corporation  hewlett packard company and microsoft corporation  providers of event notification and response technology  such as attention software  inc  providers of windows nt management and migration tools  such as aelita corporation  netiq corporation and quest software  certain management features included in our products compete with the native tools from novell  inc and microsoft and third party tools from certain vendors  providers of enterprise resource planning application add ons for sap security administration and vulnerability assessment  such as csi international and kpmg consulting  and providers of network security scanning technology  such as network associates  iss group  inc and symantec corporation in addition  companies such as novell and microsoft also offer native tools with their products that provide a basic set of management tools 
while these tools provide help in certain administrative tasks for their own platform  they do not help large company administrators cope with the day to day management tasks that they are challenged with 
bindview solutions provide an easy to use interface  and scale to the largest of the heterogeneous environments 
bindview is in a unique position to help address the growing demand for cross platform security and administration solutions in these installations 
we expect competition in the network management software market to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines and services 
in addition  we have noted what appears to be a recent trend of consolidation in that market through mergers and acquisitions 
three recent examples are mission critical software s merger with netiq  symantec s acquisition of axent technologies  quest software s acquisition of fastlane technologies inc  and braintree software s announced acquisition by pentasafe 
if such consolidation continues  it could result in the creation of new competitors and or enhancement of the competitive capabilities of existing competitors 
many of these existing and potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater resources that can be devoted to the development  promotion and sale of their products  more established sales channels  greater software development experience  and greater name recognition 
our competitors compete with us not only for sales  but also for employees 
we have noted that from time to time  certain competitors seem to target our sales force  and to a lesser extent our software development staff  in their recruiting efforts 
in some respects this is a consequence of our growth in headcount  because we have succeeded in building up a pool of talent that has become an attractive target for raiding by recruiters 
we have taken steps that we deem appropriate to remind departing employees and certain competitors of our employees confidentiality and non competition obligations 
if we continue to increase the size of our talent pool as we intend  we expect that this raiding will continue 
we also believe that operating system software vendors  particularly microsoft and novell  could enhance their products to include functionality that we currently provide in our products 
if these vendors include our software functionality as standard features of their operating system software  our products could become obsolete 
even if the functionality of the standard software features of these vendors is more limited than ours  there is a substantial risk that a significant number of customers would elect to keep this limited functionality rather than purchase additional software 
to be competitive  we must respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological change  evolving standards and our competitors innovations by continuing to enhance our products  services and sales channels 
in addition  we have and may continue to bundle and offer discounts to our customers 
bundling or discounting our products may result in reduced operating margins  reduced profitability and increase the complexity of revenue recognition 
any pricing pressures  reduced margins or loss of market share resulting from our failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business 
our products are subject to rapid technological change 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if new products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
we rely heavily on our relationships with microsoft and novell and attempt to coordinate our product offerings with the future releases of their operating systems 
these companies may not notify us of feature enhancements prior to new releases of their operating systems in the future 
in that case  we may not be able to introduce products on a timely basis that capitalize on new operating system releases and feature enhancements 
client server computing environments are inherently complex 
as a result  we usually cannot precisely estimate our software product life cycles 
new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods  which depend significantly on our ability to hire and retain increasingly scarce and technically competent personnel 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in installing or implementing new product releases could seriously damage our business 
we have  on occasion  experienced delays in the scheduled introduction of new and enhanced products and cannot be certain that such delays will not occur again 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  the products  capabilities or technologies developed by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or shorten their life cycles 
we are dependent upon continued growth of the market for windows nt and novell netware operating systems 
we depend upon the success of microsoft s windows nt and novell s netware operating systems 
in particular  market acceptance of our products depends on the increasing complexity of these operating systems and the lack of effective tools to simplify system administration and security management for these environments 
although demand for windows nt and netware operating systems has grown in recent years  we cannot be certain that it will continue to grow 
if the market does continue to grow  we cannot be certain that the market for our products will continue to develop or that our products will be widely accepted 
if the markets for our products fail to develop or develop more slowly than we anticipate  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the percentages of our revenues attributable to software licenses for particular operating system platforms can change from time to time 
a number of factors outside our control can cause these changes  including changing market acceptance and penetration of the various operating system platforms that we support and the relative mix of development and installation by value added resellers vars of application software operating on such platforms 
we are affected by the migration rate to windows our ability to sell licenses for some of our bv admin migration products will depend in part on the rate at which customers and potential customers elect to migrate their networks to microsoft s windows operating system 
some observers have noted that this migration rate has been slower than expected 
if the migration rate continues to remain comparatively slow  it could materially and adversely affect our revenues from such migration products 
product concentration 
a majority of our revenues are from the sale of our bv control product 
we anticipate that these products  along with product added as a result of the curasoft  netect and entevo acquisitions  will account for a majority or all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future operating results will depend on continued market acceptance of our bv control product family  introduction of new products from the curasoft  netect and entevo acquisitions  enhancements to these products and the continued development of additional snap in modules for our rms console software 
competition  technological change or other factors could reduce demand for  or market acceptance of any or all of our products and could substantially damage our business 
although we currently plan to broaden our product line  we cannot be certain that we will be able to reduce our product concentration or that we will be able to generate material revenues from products acquired as a result of the curasoft  netect and entevo acquisitions 
risks associated with length of sales cycle 
we have sold our products to customer workgroups and corporate divisions 
as a result  our sales cycle has ranged from three to six months 
recently  we have increased our product offerings and have also focused more of our selling effort on products for the customer s entire enterprise and as a result  have found that our sales cycle to enterprises has ranged from six to beyond twelve months 
in addition  we are currently transitioning our telesales force into a direct sales model 
our ability to effectively transition our sales force to this model can directly impact the length of our sales cycle 
the sales cycle to enterprises is typically longer for a number of reasons  including the significant resources committed to an evaluation of network management software by an enterprise require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them on the value of our products and services  and decisions to license and deploy enterprise wide software generally involve an evaluation of our software by a significant number of personnel of the enterprise in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
as a result  we cannot predict the timing and amount of specific sales 
our inability to complete one or more enterprise wide sales in a particular quarter or calendar year could materially adversely affect our business and could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
need to manage changing operations 
we have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years 
we intend to continue to expand in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement and improve these systems  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel 
our success depends largely on the efforts of our senior executive officers  particularly eric j 
pulaski  chairman of the board and chief technology officer of bindview  richard p 
gardner  president and chief executive officer  kevin weiss  chief marketing officer  paul j 
cormier  vice president of research and development  and william d 
miller  vice president of worldwide sales at bindview 
on january   scott r 
plantowsky  bindview s vice president and chief financial officer  resigned 
we are currently looking for a replacement officer 
if a suitable replacement is not located  this could affect our operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our senior executive officers 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled research and development  technical support and sales and marketing personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  and we cannot be certain that we will successfully attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key individuals or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could substantially damage our business 
risks associated with international sales and operations 
during  and  we derived approximately  and of our revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america 
over the last months  we have opened direct telesales offices outside the united states 
we have historically generated revenues outside north america through indirect channels  including vars and other distributors 
we are in the early stages of developing our indirect distribution channels in certain markets outside the united states 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract third parties that will be able to market our products effectively or to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our reseller arrangements generally provide that resellers may carry competing product offerings 
we cannot be certain that any distributor or reseller will continue to represent our products 
the inability to recruit  or the loss of  important sales personnel  distributors or resellers could materially and adversely affect our business 
as we expand our sales and support operations internationally  we anticipate that international revenues will grow as a percentage of our total revenues 
to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional international direct telesales offices  expand the management and support organizations for our international sales channel  hire additional personnel  customize our products for local markets  recruit additional international resellers where appropriate  and expand the use of our direct telesales model 
if we are unable to generate increased sales through a direct telesales model  we will incur higher personnel costs without corresponding increases in revenue  resulting in lower operating margins for our international operations 
in addition  employment policies vary among countries outside the united states  which may reduce our flexibility in managing headcount and  in turn  managing personnel related expenses 
if we do not address the risks associated with international sales in a cost effective and timely manner  our international sales growth will be limited  operating margins could be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected 
however  even if we are able to successfully expand our international operations  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
limited protection of proprietary technology  risks of infringement 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our software and other proprietary technology 
the software industry has experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products 
we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret law as well as contractual restrictions to protect our technology 
these legal protections provide only limited protection 
the steps we have taken may deter competitors from misappropriating our proprietary information 
however  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we litigated to enforce our rights  litigation would be expensive  would divert management resources and may not be adequate to protect our business 
we also could be subject to claims alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our distribution partners and end users for similar claims made against them 
any claims against us could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims 
as a result  claims against us could materially adversely affect our business 
risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions 
we have made and may continue to make investments in complementary companies  technologies  services or products if we find appropriate opportunities 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel and operations of the acquired company 
if we make other types of acquisitions  assimilating the technology  services or products into our operations could be difficult 
acquisitions can disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures 
we may not succeed in overcoming these risks or in any other problems we might encounter in connection with any future acquisitions 
we may be required to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions of netect and entevo or that we will be able to integrate the products and technology we acquired into our sales model or product offerings 
risks of undetected software errors 
our software products are complex and may contain certain undetected errors  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have previously discovered software errors in certain of our new products after their introduction 
we cannot be certain that  despite our testing  such errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
such undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance or claims against us by customers  all of which could materially adversely affect our business 
risk of liability claims 
because our products provide network management services  it is possible that we could receive liability claims 
our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims 
these limitations may not  however  preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
as a result  any such claims  whether or not successful  could damage our reputation and our business 
anti takeover provisions 
incumbent management and our board of directors could use certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if the change in control might be beneficial to our stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency exchange rates we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at december   we estimate that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur 
interest rate risk we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on liquid assets 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments approximated million and million at december  and  respectively 
such amounts were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a value at risk var model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur
