we enable organizations to leverage it infrastructure investments by maximizing the performance and availability of enterprise applications with solutions for high availability  application monitoring  database management  sql development  and report management 
our acquisitions of foglight software  inc foglight and fastlane technologies  inc fastlane were highlights of  a year in which we experienced significant growth in our sales  support  professional services and research and development headcount and expanded our executive management and administrative team to meet the needs of our customers and employees worldwide 
our integration activities relative to these acquisitions during has been primarily dedicated to modifying  enhancing  testing  documenting and otherwise integrating acquired technologies into our product offerings 
we have dedicated significant development resources to create versions of foglight for a variety of applications and database platforms  and have used fastlane s position in the directory management solutions market as a platform on which to promote our entry into the microsoft solutions and systems management market 
we believe these integration activities  together with our internal research and development efforts  will help us position quest as the leading provider of application management solutions  with a comprehensive set of software solutions supporting the leading database platform vendors with specific solutions for leading business critical applications 
all of our acquisitions in were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and our operating results reflect the activities of acquired business only from their respective acquisition dates 
as a result of our acquisitions in  we recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets of approximately million in total 
these assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives  and will result in charges to operations of at least million per quarter through the second quarter of for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss due to the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to these acquisitions 
these acquisitions also contributed to increases in all operating expense categories  and the impact of acquisitions on operating expenses may be greater in  which will reflect a full year of operations 
due to the integration that has taken place to date  it is not possible to quantify the portion of increases in revenues or operating expenses attributable to these acquisitions 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of software licenses and related annual maintenance fees 
our total revenues have increased over each of the past five fiscal years  from million in to million in pricing of our software licenses is based on the number of servers  workstations and or users of our products 
services consist primarily of annual maintenance contracts for technical support and product enhancements  and consulting services 
we recognize software license revenues when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed with a customer  delivery of the software has occurred  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant post delivery vendor obligations remain and collection is deemed probable 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically one year 
revenues for consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
international revenues from licenses and services sold to customers outside of north america were million in  million in and million in we intend to expand our international sales activities as part of our business strategy 
all of our current international revenues are derived from the operations of our wholly owned international subsidiaries  which consist of both direct sales and sales through distributors 
our international subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate with the exception of mexico and brazil where the us dollar is used  exposing us to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains which are outside of our control 
historically  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our business 
we have not  to date  conducted any hedging transactions to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations 
in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  our software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant  and all costs related to internal research and development have been expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues licenses services total revenues cost of revenues licenses services amortization of purchased intangible assets total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative other compensation costs and goodwill amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income other expense  net income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss years ended december   and revenues revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to  and million  or  from to international revenues accounted for  and of total revenues for  and  respectively

international licenses accounted for  and of total licenses in  and  respectively 
the increase in licenses from to was due to expansion of our worldwide sales force  as well as the introduction of new products in the increase in licenses from to was due to continued expansion of our worldwide sales force  as well as increased market acceptance of our software products and introduction of new products 
services services were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to  and million  or from to services represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increases in services reflect an increase in the number of software licenses sold with maintenance agreements and renewals of maintenance agreements on existing licenses  as well as increased consulting and training revenues

cost of revenues cost of licenses cost of licenses was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from to  and an increase of million  or  from to cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of licenses from to was due to decreases for both royalties and amortization as a result of reaching several royalty maximums and completion of amortization of certain purchased technology 
the increase in cost of licenses from to was principally a result of an increase in product media  duplication and printing costs 
the decreases in cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues in resulted from increased license revenues without a corresponding increase in amortization of acquired software licenses  which does not vary by the number of licenses sold 
cost of services cost of services was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from and  and million  or  from to cost of services as a percentage of service revenues was  and for  and  respectively 
the increases in cost of services in these periods are primarily due to the increase in the number of technical support personnel required to manage and support our growing customer base as well as increased product offerings 
we also formed a professional services consulting organization during the first half of  which did not exist in or our gross margins on services revenues could fluctuate in the future  reflecting the timing differences between increasing our organization investments and the corresponding revenue growth that we expect as a result 
we expect the cost of services to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as additional customer support and consulting personnel are hired 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets was million in  which includes amortization of the fair value of acquired technology  workforce and customer lists associated with the acquisitions made during there were no similar costs during and operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to  and million  or  from to the increases reflect our increasing investment in our sales and marketing organization  which from to included an increase in salaries and related expenses of million  a million increase in commissions and a million increase in marketing communications expenses 
the increases from to included an increase in salaries and related expenses of million  a million increase in commissions  million increase in travel and related costs  and a million increase in promotional  conference and tradeshow expenses

we believe significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive  and expect these expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to  and million  or  from to the most significant expense increases during both periods were for salaries and related expenses  rent and depreciation  which were the result of increased number of related personnel 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance our infrastructure and support expansion of our operations 
other compensation costs and goodwill amortization other compensation costs and goodwill amortization was million in and million in included in was million related to the severance package provided to one of our founders and a director  which will be paid out over a three year period  million of compensation costs related to the grant of stock options at less than fair market value and million of goodwill amortization related to acquisitions

see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business  to date  primarily from cash generated by our operations  net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in august and net proceeds of million from our secondary offering in march our sources of liquidity as of december  consisted principally of cash and cash equivalents of million  and million in both short and long term high grade corporate and government marketable securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to increases in net income after excluding non cash depreciation and amortization expense and increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenue  offset by increases in accounts receivable and deferred income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to net purchases of marketable securities of million  acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on acquisitions 
capital expenditures primarily consisted of equipment and related purchases to support our worldwide expansion and related infrastructure needs 
financing activities used  in  and generated million and million in and  respectively 
in april  we raised million through the sale of preferred stock and an additional million in term debt from a commercial bank in order to purchase shares of common stock from a shareholder and founder for million 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in august  we raised net proceeds of million from our initial public offering 
a portion of the proceeds was utilized to retire debt of million and redeem the outstanding series b preferred stock for million 
in march  we raised net proceeds of million from a secondary public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
of the shares sold in the offering million shares were sold by the company and million shares were sold by existing shareholders 
the company did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling shareholders 
in december  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company may purchase up to two million shares of its common stock 
under the repurchase program  the company may purchase shares from time to time at varying prices in open market or private transactions 
as of december   the company had repurchased million shares for million under the plan 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june   and establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative which would be required to be reported as assets or liabilities and carried at fair value 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
on december   the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
is effective for the fourth quarter in fiscal year the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements  as the company believes its revenue recognition policies comply with sab no 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the definition of an employee for purposes of applying accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
this interpretation is effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the provisions of fin change the accounting for an exchange of unvested employee stock options and restricted stock awards in a purchase business combination 
the new rules require the intrinsic value of the unvested awards be allocated to deferred compensation and recognized as non cash compensation expense over the remaining future vesting period 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements  other than the effect of the application of fin as it relates to the company s acquisitions as described in note risk factors an investment in our shares involves risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the factors described below before making an investment decision in our securities 
the risks described below are the risks that we currently believe are material risks of business and the industry in which we compete 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the following risks 
if we are adversely affected by such risks  then the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and  as a result  we may fail to meet expectations of investors and analysts  causing our stock price to fluctuate or decline our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
these factors include the following the size and timing of customer orders 
see the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues 
the unpredictability of the timing and level of sales through our indirect sales channel  the timing of revenue recognition for sales of software products and services  the extent to which our customers renew their maintenance contracts with us  the possibility that our customers may cancel or defer purchases as a result of reduced it budgets or in anticipation of new products or product updates by us or by our competitors  the possibility of an economic slowdown generally  the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  our ability to attain market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements to our existing products  lack of order backlog  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  the relative growth rates of the windows nt and unix markets  as well as the rate of adoption of microsoft s release of windows by users  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  including amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and the timing of releases of new versions of third party software products that our products support 
fluctuations in our results of operations are likely to affect the market price of our common stock that may not be related to our long term performance 
the size and timing of our customer orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter which could cause fluctuations in our revenues in any given quarter  sales of some of our products have involved large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers  and cancellation or deferral of these large contracts would reduce our revenues 
in addition  the sales cycles for certain of our software products  such as vista plus and shareplex  can last from three to nine months and often require pre purchase evaluation periods and customer education 
these relatively long sales cycles may cause significant periodic variation in our license revenues 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month or weeks of each quarter and delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall short of anticipated levels 
finally  while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from previously deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
many of our products are dependent on oracle s technologies  if oracle s technologies lose market share or become incompatible with our products  the demand for our products could suffer we believe that our success has depended in part  and will continue to depend in part for the foreseeable future  upon our relationship with oracle and our status as a complementary software provider for oracle s database and application products 
many versions of our products  including shareplex  sqlab vision  and sql navigator  are specifically designed to be used with oracle databases 
although a number of our products work with other environments  our competitive advantage consists in substantial part on the integration between our products and oracle s products  and our extensive knowledge of oracle s technology 
currently  a significant portion of our total revenues are derived from products that specifically support oracle based products 
if oracle for any reason decides to promote technologies and standards that are not compatible with our technology  or if oracle loses market share for its database products  our business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
many of our products are vulnerable to direct competition from oracle we currently compete with oracle in the market for database management solutions 
we expect that oracle s commitment to and presence in the database management product market will increase in the future and therefore substantially increase competitive pressures 
we believe that oracle will continue to incorporate database management technology into its server software offerings  possibly at no additional cost to its users 
we believe that oracle will also continue to enhance its database management technology 
furthermore  oracle could attempt to increase its presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  and oracle may be in better position to withstand and respond to the current factors impacting this industry 
oracle has a longer operating history  a larger installed base of customers and substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and technical resources than we do 
in addition  oracle has well established relationships with many of our present and potential customers 
as a result  we may not be able to compete effectively with oracle in the future  which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to develop new and enhanced products that achieve widespread market acceptance our future success depends on our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing and introducing new products  product updates and services on a timely basis  by extending the operation of our products on new platforms and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards 
in order to grow our business  we are committing substantial resources to developing software products and services for the applications management market 
if this markets does not continue to develop as anticipated  or demand for our products in these markets does not materialize or occurs more slowly that we expect  or if our development efforts are delayed or unsuccessful  we will have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenue  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business and diversion of management attention we have in the past made and we expect to continue to make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make any additional acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition or may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our shareholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisition 
our ability to increase our revenues depends on our ability to expand our indirect sales channels we intend to aggressively pursue expansion of our indirect sales channels through arrangements with resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
in certain domestic and international markets we may miss sales opportunities if we are unable to enter into successful relationships with locally based resellers 
we may become more dependent on these type of relationships 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these relationships or that the expansion of indirect sales distribution methods will increase revenues 
our past and future growth may strain our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure we have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our operations that has placed and will continue to place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
during this period  we have experienced an increase in the number of our employees  increasing demands on our operating and financial systems and personnel  and an expansion in the geographic coverage of our operations 
the number of our full time employees increased from as of december  to as of december   to as of december  and to  as of december  our ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls  and reporting systems and procedures 
we may need to expand our facilities or relocate some or all of our employees or operations from time to time to support growth 
these relocations could result in temporary disruptions of our operations or a diversion of management s attention and resources 
in addition  we will be required to hire additional management  financial and sales and marketing personnel to manage our expanding operations 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we may not generate increased business from our current customers  which could slow our revenue growth in the future most of our customers initially make a purchase of our products for a single department or location 
many of these customers may choose not to expand their use of our products 
if we fail to generate expanded business from our current customers  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  as we deploy new modules and features for our existing products or introduce new products  our current customers may choose not to purchase this new functionality or these new products 
moreover  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues would be materially adversely affected 
we expect to incur significant increases in our operating expenses in the foreseeable future  which may affect our future profitability we intend to substantially increase our operating expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our direct sales and telesales forces  increase our research and development activities  expand our general and administrative activities  and expand our customer support organizations 
accordingly  we will be required to significantly increase our revenues in order to maintain profitability 
these expenses will be incurred before we generate any revenues by this increased spending 
if we do not significantly increase revenues from these efforts  our business and operating results would be negatively impacted 
our international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations exposes us to certain risks substantially all of our current international revenues are derived from the operations of three of our wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  the united kingdom and germany 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside of north america were million in  representing of total revenues  million in  representing of total revenues  and million in  representing of total revenues 
as a result  we face increasing risks from doing business on an international basis  including  among others difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  delays in localizing our products  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  because our international subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  we are subject to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains which are outside of our control 
we plan to expand our international operations as part of our business strategy 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources and will place additional burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability 
in addition  we have sold our products internationally for only a few years and we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and marketing and distributing them internationally 
as our international operations expand  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will increase as we use an increasing number of foreign currencies 
we have not yet entered into any hedging transactions to date to mitigate our expense to currency fluctuations 
our recently implemented strategy of investing in development stage companies involves a number of risks and uncertainties we have and may continue to make investments in development stage companies that we believe provide strategic opportunities for quest 
each of these investments involves a number of risks and uncertainties  including diversion of management attention  inability to identify strategic opportunities  inability to value investments appropriately  inability to manage investments effectively and loss of cash invested 
we intend that these investments will complement our own research and development efforts  provide access to new technologies and emerging markets  and create opportunities for additional sales of our products and services 
however  we cannot assure you that this initiative will have the above mentioned desired results  or even that we will not lose all or any part of these investments 
failure to develop strategic relationships could harm our business by denying us selling opportunities and other benefits our current collaborative relationships may not prove to be beneficial to us  and they may not be sustained 
we also may not be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
from time to time  we have collaborated with other companies  including hewlett packard and oracle and certain of the national accounting firms that provide system integration services  in areas such as product development  marketing  distribution and implementation 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties 
moreover  we expect that maintaining and enhancing these and other relationships will become a more meaningful part of our business strategy in the future 
however  many of our current partners are either actual or potential competitors with us 
in addition  many of these third parties also work with competing software companies and we may not be able to maintain these existing relationships  due to the fact that these relationships are informal or  if written  are terminable with little or no notice 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected  and there is risk of infringement claims or independent development of competing technology that could harm our competitive position our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate and competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also believe that  because of the rapid rate of technological change in the software industry  trade secret and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of our employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of customer support services 
our success and ability to compete are also dependent on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to either license the infringed or similar technology or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  we may incur substantial licensing fees  be liable for infringement damage  or be unable to market our products 
our business will suffer if our software contains errors the software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate it with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our operating margins could be harmed 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the shipping of  our products certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology licensed to us  such alternate sources may not provide us with the same functionality as that currently provided to us 
natural disasters or power outages could disrupt our business a substantial portion of our operations are located in california  and we are subject to risks of damage and business disruptions resulting from earthquakes  floods and similar events  as well as from power outages 
we have recently experienced limited and temporary power losses in our california facilities due to power shortages  and we expect in the future to experience additional power losses 
while the impact to our business and operating results has not been material  we cannot assure you that power losses will not adversely affect our business in the future  or that the cost of acquiring sufficient power to run our business will not increase significantly 
since we do not have sufficient redundancy in our networking infrastructure  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem could have an adverse effect on our business  including both our internal operations and our ability to communicate with our customers or sell and deliver our products 
risks related to our industry the demand for our products will depend on our ability to adapt to rapid technological change our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards characterize the market for our products 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers for embedded databases and web based products  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
as a result  significant delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  avoiding difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of these products  or achieving market acceptance for our new products and product enhancements 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel our future success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing and support personnel  many of whom have recently joined our company 
in addition  the success of our business is substantially dependent on the services of our chief executive officer and our president and chief technical officer 
we intend to hire a significant number of additional sales  support  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel over at least the next months 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
competition for skilled personnel is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business may not be able to grow if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
hiring qualified sales  marketing  administrative  research and development and customer support personnel  is very competitive in our industry  particularly in southern california  where quest is headquartered 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenues and operating expenses in australia  the united kingdom and germany denominated in the respective local currency 
to date  we have not used hedging contracts to hedge our foreign currency fluctuation risks 
we will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we also do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio

available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
at december   the net gain on available for sale securities of  comprises positions  of which positions have unrealized gains and seven positions have unrealized losses
