item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s environmental matters 
safety matters the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act osha and similar state statutes 
the company has an extensive health and safety program and employs a staff of safety inspectors and industrial hygiene technicians whose primary functions are to develop company policies that meet or exceed the safety standards set by osha  train production supervisors and make periodic inspections of safety procedures to insure compliance with company policies on safety and industrial hygiene 
all employees are required to attend regularly scheduled safety training meetings 
backlog at april  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of million and million at april  and march  respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are awarded 
investments and acquisitions the company has from time to time pursued opportunities to diversify its business  in areas such as metal fabrication  marine transportation  other marine industries and businesses unrelated to the shipyard 
the company continues to evaluate suitable investment opportunities  which it believes will appropriately utilize the company s resources 
during fiscal year the company did not make any direct investments in other businesses  either related or unrelated to ship repair and overhaul activities 
item properties during the company s fourth quarter  the puget sound region experienced the effects of a moderate earthquake 
the company sustained damage to its physical plant that required certain emergency repairs to be made 
additional earthquake repairs  of a non emergency nature will be required to be made during fiscal year the company is continuing to evaluate its alternatives and plans for repairing this damage  as well as potential recoveries under its insurance coverage see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statement in item 
the company does not anticipate that these repairs will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operation 
the company is required to maintain navy certification on its drydocks and cranes in order to qualify its facilities to bid on and perform work under certain navy and united states coast guard coast guard contracts 
damage caused by the earthquake resulted in the navy temporarily suspending its certifications of the company s three drydocks 
after completing certain repairs  the company s certification on drydock yfd was reinstated prior to the end of fiscal year the company s certification on the emerald sea drydock was reinstated subsequent to the end of fiscal year drydock yfd  is not currently certified  however  the company plans to complete repairs and obtain reinstatement during the second quarter of fiscal year the current de certification of drydock yfd is not expected to impact current drydock schedules or shipyard operations 
in addition  damage caused by the earthquake resulted in the company making certain repairs to various cranes 
repairs to all cranes that are critical to shipyard operations were made prior to the end of fiscal year and the company obtained re certification on these cranes 
the design capacities of the company s three drydocks  all of which are located at the shipyard  are as follows year type max 
design date of lease name built owned leased capacity in tons expiration emerald sea steel  yfd steel  yfd wood  during fiscal year  the company extended the leases on each of its leased drydocks for a period of five years 
under terms of the expiring leases  the company was required to make annual lease payments  as well as perform a minimum amount of annual maintenance on each dock 
the new lease terms on drydock yfd contain a nominal annual lease payment and an increase in the minimum amount of annual maintenance that the company must perform 
the new lease also includes minimum levels of maintenance that the company must perform during the life of the lease 
the new lease terms on drydock yfd call for a continuation of both an annual lease payment and a certain minimum amount of annual maintenance to be performed by the company 
the company has included the nominal lease payment and the amortized maintenance cost that must be performed over the life of the lease on drydock yfd  as well as the annual lease payments that must be made on drydock yfd in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item the company s current navy certifications are less than the maximum design capacity  however they are sufficient to allow the company to perform work on all non nuclear navy vessels homeported in puget sound  as well as all coast guard vessels 
the company believes that its owned and leased properties at the shipyard are in reasonable operating condition given their age and usage  although  from time to time  the company has been required to incur substantial expenditures to ensure the continuing serviceability of its owned and leased machinery and equipment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company determined that such serviceability repairs would be required on the emerald sea to maintain navy certification on a long term basis 
certain repairs began subsequent to the end of fiscal year and will continue into fiscal year the company is currently evaluating several factors  including but not limited to  alternative repair scenarios and management s plans for future operations to develop a more comprehensive  multi year refurbishment plan that will allow the company to maintain certification into the future 
this multi year plan may include increased annual maintenance costs and or increased capital expenditures 
although the ultimate course of action cannot be predicted  based on current information management believes that fiscal year maintenance costs for existing dry dock facilities will increase over fiscal year item legal proceedings the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these laws 
such laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for acts of the company  which are or were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the company faces potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company is identified as a prp by the environmental protection agency epa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund in connection with matters pending at three superfund sites 
additionally  the company has been named as a prp in three superfund cases and has received information requests in two superfund cases where the company has asserted that its liability was discharged when it emerged from bankruptcy in generally these environmental claims relate to sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the matters relating to the harbor island site  where the company s shipyard is located  are discussed below

included in the company s million total reserve for environmental matters is a reserve of million to address the harbor island site 
harbor island site insurance on january   the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of all of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount equal to and exceeding the company s current booked reserves of approximately million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from current cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year the second payment was made subsequent to the end of fiscal year the company has recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable as of april  in accordance with its environmental accounting policies 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
harbor island site history to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect the company the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
the company  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
the company entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which the company has agreed to remediate the designated contamination on its property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year the company and the epa are currently negotiating the extent and methodology of the soil remediation 
the company estimates remediation of the entire soil unit will take approximately to months from the clean up start date 
during the third quarter of the fiscal year  the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative solutions for the ssou remediation and identifies the epa s selected remedy 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
the company evaluated what it believed was the financial impact of the epa s actions and increased its reserves to million for the remedial effort 
this reserve increase resulted in a million charge against fiscal year earnings 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
the management believes that the timing and cost of the ssou clean up will remain significantly uncertain until a remedial design has been finalized with the epa that identifies the scope of remediation and the method of sediment disposal 
during the company s fiscal year  several species of salmon in washington state were designated under the endangered species act 
the potential impact the designation could have on the remedial efforts on the harbor island superfund site is unknown at this time  although any related costs within aggregate policy limits will be covered by insurance purchased in january during january  the company was notified by the epa that testing would be required in the west waterway of the duwamish river outside the borders of the ssou as part of the sou 
the company during may entered into an administrative order on consent to perform certain limited testing as part of the sou investigation 
after an evaluation of the results  the epa issued a draft no action rod on the sou for public comment which if issued in final form would end the investigation of the sou  requiring no remedial action 
the public comment period closed during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and the epa has not yet announced the results 
the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the company has approximately cases involving plaintiffs pending against it and other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers and equipment manufacturers  involving injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
most of these cases have been filed since by heirs of retired employees or employees of subcontractors who allegedly worked at company sites  and allege contact with asbestos for varying periods of time and allege that such exposure caused illness and or death 
the cases are generally filed with multiple claimants and multiple defendants and are generally insured matters 
suits of this nature generally seek amounts in excess of  on behalf of each claimant as against all defendants 
claims resolved to date have been settled for net amounts that are immaterial to the company s financial condition and operating results 
by their very nature  civil actions relating to toxic substances vary according to the cases fact patterns  jurisdiction and other factors 
potential additional future expenses related to alleged damages from past exposure to toxic substances is not quantifiable due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements 
accordingly  the company cannot predict the eventual number of such cases or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
the company has included an estimate of its potential liability for known cases in its environmental reserves net of insurance recoveries

item management s discussion analysis of financial condition and results of operations the notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction herewith 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results in future periods may differ significantly from the results discussed in or anticipated by such forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may impact results for future periods are discussed below under the captions overview profitability  and environmental matters 
readers should also consider the statements and factors discussed under the caption operations overview in item of the company s annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission for the fiscal year ended april   and in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year then ended 
overview during fiscal year  the company recorded revenue of million  which represented a decrease of million  or  over fiscal year revenue 
this revenue decline would have been greater if not for the favorable impact of two significant events 
first  the company reached an agreement with the us navy in the fourth quarter to share in certain environmental insurance costs 
under terms of the agreement  the company was able to invoice and record revenue of million 
second  the company received a favorable arbitration award on the margarita ii  a floating electrical power plant that was completed in fiscal year the award allowed the company to recognize million of revenue in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
excluding these two events  fiscal year revenues reported would have been million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year revenue 
decreases in the fiscal year revenues primarily reflect commercial and government ship owners cyclical overhaul schedule considerations  partially offset by the favorable impact of the two significant events discussed above 
repair and overhaul activities represented approximately and of fiscal year and fiscal year revenues  respectively 
the high concentration of repair and overhaul activities in relation to overall revenue during the past two fiscal years reflects the company s business strategy of emphasizing repair and overhaul activities  while discontinuing the pursuit of new construction opportunities 
this strategy has been a central component of the company s business plan since the completion of the margarita ii in fiscal year during fiscal year the company recorded operating income of million on revenue of million  or of revenue 
operating income for fiscal year was impacted favorably by the agreement reached with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs  as well as the arbitration award on the margarita ii 
in addition to the favorable impact of these two items  the company recorded a net environmental insurance settlement of million  which was partially offset by a million environmental reserve charge  which resulted in a net increase to operating income of million for the fiscal year 
excluding the favorable impact of these items  fiscal year operating income reported would have been million  or of adjusted revenue of million 
the company also recognized a net gain of million from the sale of available for sale securities  and million in non operating investment income during fiscal year these amounts in addition to the operating income reported  resulted in fiscal year income before income tax expense of million 
combatant maintenance team cmt contract during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded  by the department of the navy on a sole source basis  a five year  cost type contract for the repair and maintenance of six surface combatant class vessels frigates and destroyers stationed in the puget sound area 
although the navy has not released a notional value of the maintenance work  the company believes that the value may be approximately million to million if all options are exercised 
work on this contract  which will be performed primarily in the company s seattle shipyard  began late in the company s first quarter 
auxiliary oiler explosive aoe contract in may  the company was awarded a cost type contract for phased maintenance repairs to four navy aoe class supply ships stationed in the puget sound area during a five year availability schedule 
the contract  which has been performed primarily at the company s seattle shipyard  had an original  notional value of million 
based on current availability schedules the contract is anticipated to conclude during the second quarter of the company s fiscal year in response to the impending conclusion of the current contract  the navy announced during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year its intention to renew the existing aoe contract with the company on a sole source basis for an additional six years 
this contract will represent the fourth consecutive  multi year contract that the company has been awarded by the navy on the aoe class vessels 
the three previous contracts  which were each five years in duration  were all awarded on a competitive basis 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the company completed negotiations with the navy and was awarded a renewal contract on june  the notional value of this contract is expected to be approximately million over a six year period if all options are exercised 
planned incremental availability pia in january  the department of the navy awarded the company a five year cost type contract for phased maintenance on three cvn class aircraft carriers 
the notional value for this five year contract is approximately million 
work on this contract is performed primarily at the puget sound naval shipyard  located in bremerton  washington 
preservation contract during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company was awarded a million overhaul contract to renovate the washington state ferry  mv yakima 
work on this project commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year and called for the replacement or renovation of the majority of the vessel s interior structures  including the replacement of steel plating  passenger area furniture  galley  fixtures  windows  and the removal of hazardous materials 
on january   the company successfully completed and delivered the vessel to the washington state ferry system ahead of the contractually scheduled delivery date 
the company earned financial incentives for the early delivery of the vessel and these incentives have been recognized in its current year contract revenue 
power barge contract margarita ii in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company commenced work on a floating electrical power plant  the margarita ii  under a new construction contract with an estimated price of approximately million 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the margarita ii was delivered to its owner 
to maintain production schedule deadlines and perform customer directed change orders  the company experienced significant contract cost growth in both labor hours and material 
however  agreement was not reached between the company and the owner regarding the potential increase in the contract price  if any  to compensate for all of these changes 
in accordance with the terms of the contract  the company and the vessel owner agreed to settle the remaining change orders through a formal arbitration process 
formal arbitration hearings  which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  concluded during the third quarter of fiscal year  when both parties submitted final written arguments to the arbitration board 
on may   the company was awarded approximately million from the arbitration board 
under the award the company is also entitled to receive interest and reimbursement of certain agreed expenses 
the company recognized the award in fiscal year business volume and backlog at april  the company s backlog consists of approximately million of repair  maintenance  and conversion work 
this compares with backlogs of million and million at april  and march  respectively 
the company s current backlog is primarily attributable to firm repair  maintenance and conversion work scheduled for completion during fiscal year since work under the company s three navy phased maintenance contracts is at the option of the navy  the company cannot provide assurance as to the timing or level of work that may be performed under these contracts 
therefore  projected revenues from these contracts are not included in the company s backlog until contract options are awarded 
profitability the company s future profitability depends largely on the ability of the shipyard to maintain an adequate volume of ship repair  overhaul and conversion business to augment its longer term contracts 
the variables affecting the company s business volume include public support provided to competing northwest shipyards  excess west coast and industry wide shipyard capacity  foreign competition  governmental legislation and regulatory issues  activity levels of the us navy  competitors pricing behavior  and company labor efficiencies and work practices 
other factors that can contribute to future profitability include the amounts of annual expenditures needed to ensure continuing seviceability of the company s owned and leased machinery and equipment 
the company continues to respond aggressively to the increasingly competitive shipbuilding and repair industry 
in addition to management s focus on the profitability of existing shipyard operations through reduced operating costs  improved production efficiencies and the pursuit of business volume  management continues to evaluate options for deployment of assets with a view to improving the company s return on investment 
year to year comparisons compared with net income for fiscal year increased by million from fiscal year levels 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of the settlement reached with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs which resulted in the company recognizing million in revenue and the arbitration award on the margarita ii which contributed approximately million in revenue  interest income and reimbursed expenses 
net income for fiscal year was impacted unfavorably by a net environmental reserve charge of million  which contributes to the comparative increase shown in fiscal year net income for fiscal year was also influenced as a result of the following components 
revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represents a decrease of million  or  over fiscal year revenue 
the company recorded revenue of million from repair and overhaul activities during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year in addition to the million decrease in repair and overhaul activities  revenues from new construction decreased million  resulting in the net decrease of in fiscal year revenue of million 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the million in revenue the company recognized on the agreement with the us navy to share in certain environmental insurance costs and the million recognized on the margarita ii arbitration award 
costs associated with these revenues were either incurred in prior years or are not categorized as cost of revenues 
if these amounts were excluded from revenue the resulting cost of revenues as a percentage of revised revenues would be administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  administrative and manufacturing overhead was of revenue in fiscal year this percentage increases to if revenues are adjusted to exclude the favorable impacts to revenue that occurred in fiscal year administrative and manufacturing overhead costs as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year was 
the increase in these costs as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year is primarily attributable to plant utility costs  contract acquisition costs  financial system implementation costs and costs associated with earthquake repairs 
contract reserves activity during fiscal year  the company utilized million in previously recorded contract warranty reserves associated with the margarita ii 
this compares with fiscal year contract reserve utilization of million 
fiscal year reserve utilization offset costs incurred to complete the margarita ii and to cover mediation costs resulting from company s settlement with the ferry system on the mark ii jumbo project  as well as warranty and other post delivery costs associated with the completion of both contracts 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company provided million in additional environmental and other reserves 
in fiscal year  the company provided million in additional environmental reserves associated with the remediation of harbor island 
the reserve increase of million in fiscal year was fully offset by a net environmental insurance settlement of million realized by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year increased by million  or when compared to fiscal year contributing to this increase was approximately million in interest income that the company recognized as a result of the margarita ii arbitration award 
gain on sale of available for sale securities gain on sale of available for sale securities increased million in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year income taxes in fiscal year  the company recognized a million federal income tax benefit after applying available net operating loss carryforwards and business tax credits 
this represents a decrease of million in income tax expense when compared to fiscal year the fiscal year tax benefit is the result of the company recording its net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet based on its ability to utilize this net asset in future years 
the company has recorded its net deferred taxes as a non current deferred tax asset and a current deferred tax liability on its balance sheet at april  compared with net income for fiscal year decreased by million from fiscal year levels primarily due to the impact of the million mediated settlement reached between the company and the ferry system relating to the mark ii ferries in fiscal year and to the additional environmental reserves of million in fiscal year net income for fiscal year was also influenced as a result of the following components 
revenues the company recorded revenue of million during fiscal year  which represented an increase of million  or  over fiscal year revenue 
the company recorded revenue of million from repair and overhaul activities during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year offsetting this increase in repair and overhaul revenues were decreases in new construction revenue of million  resulting in the net increase in fiscal year revenue of million 
fiscal year new construction revenue was significantly influenced by the million mediated settlement reached between the company and the ferry system relating to the mark ii ferries 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal year increased million  or from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year cost of revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in revenues reported for fiscal year cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
administrative and manufacturing overhead administrative and manufacturing overhead increased million  or in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the increase  which was less significant than the increase in revenues  reflects the company s continuing efforts over the past three fiscal years to reduce or maintain current levels of administrative and manufacturing costs 
contract reserves activity during fiscal year  the company utilized million in previously recorded contract forward loss and warranty reserves 
this compares with fiscal year contract reserve utilization of million  offset by an additional million charge  resulting in net utilization of million 
fiscal year reserve utilization offset costs incurred to complete the margarita ii and to cover mediation costs resulting from the company s settlement with the ferry system on the mark ii jumbo project  as well as warranty and other post delivery costs associated with the completion of both contracts 
provision for environmental reserves and other during fiscal year  the company provided million in additional environmental reserves associated with the remediation of harbor island 
the company did not provide additional reserves for environmental liabilities during fiscal year the environmental reserve increase became necessary when the company determined  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the cost impact of the environmental protection agency s final remedial design data report on the shipyard sediments operable unit  which relocates and expands the current sediments boundary 
the expansion of the existing boundaries  which was reported by the company in the period ending january   significantly increases the potential cost of sediment remediation 
this reserve increase was partially offset by a million environmental insurance settlement  also realized by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the resulting net environmental reserve charge of million  which is unrelated to the current shipyard operations  reduced the company s operating income in fiscal year by approximately 
investment and other income investment and other income in fiscal year decreased by million  or from the previous fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the company recognizing in fiscal year  the remaining million gain on the sale of its galveston shipyard facility 
gain on sale of available for sale securities gain on sale of available for sale securities decreased million in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year income taxes for fiscal year  the company recognized million in income tax expense after applying available business tax credits 
this represents a decrease of million in income tax expense when compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recognized income tax expense of million after applying available net operating loss carryforwards and business tax credits 
environmental matters ongoing operations recurring costs associated with the company s environmental compliance program are not material and are expensed as incurred 
capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance are not material to the company s financial statements 
past activities the company faces significant potential liabilities in connection with the alleged presence of hazardous waste materials at its seattle shipyard and at several sites used by the company for disposal of alleged hazardous waste 
the company has also been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances at company facilities 
to date  the epa has separated the harbor island site into three operable units that affect the company the soil and groundwater unit the soil unit  the shipyard sediments operable unit the ssou and the sediments operable unit the sou 
the company  along with a number of other harbor island prps  received a special notice letter from the epa on may  pursuant to section e of cercla 
the company entered into a consent decree for the soil unit in september under which the company has agreed to remediate the designated contamination on its property 
removal of floating petroleum product from the water table began in october and is anticipated to continue through fiscal year the company and the epa are currently negotiating the extent and methodology of the soil remediation 
the company estimates remediation of the entire soil unit will take approximately to months from the clean up start date 
during the quarter ended december   the epa issued its record of decision rod for the ssou 
the rod identifies four alternative clean up remedies and specifies the epa s selected remedy the selected remedy 
the selected remedy requires sediment dredging  and installation of a clean sediment cap and various monitoring efforts extending over ten years 
the selected remedy included dredging and disposal of approximately  cubic yards of material currently in the duwamish river and elliott bay surrounding the shipyard 
the selected remedy allows for two sediment disposal options confined nearshore disposal cnd and confined aquatic disposal 
the company identified cnd as its preferred disposal method if the selected remedy is implemented 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  the epa expanded the boundaries of the ssou issuing their phase b data report and resulting explanation of significant differences outlining the changes to the rod 
within the newly established ssou boundary the company could be required to increase the amount of material to be dredged to   cubic yards of sediment material 
the company evaluated what it believed was the financial impact of the epa s actions and increased its reserves to million for the remedial effort 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company and the epa entered into an administrative order on consent for the development of the remedial design for the ssou 
the company believes that the timing and cost of the ssou clean up will remain significantly uncertain until a remedial design has been finalized with the epa that identifies the scope of remediation and the method of sediment disposal 
during the company s fiscal year  several species of salmon in washington state were designated under the endangered species act 
the potential impact the designation could have on the remedial efforts on the harbor island superfund site is unknown at this time  although any related costs within aggregate policy limits will be covered by insurance purchased in january on january   the company entered into a year agreement with an insurance company that will provide the company with broad based insurance coverage for the remediation of the company s operable units at the harbor island superfund site 
the agreement provides coverage for the known liabilities in an amount equal to and exceeding the company s current booked reserves of approximately million 
additionally  the company has entered into a year agreement for coverage of any new environmental conditions discovered at the seattle shipyard property that would require environmental remediation 
the company funded this insurance premium from current cash reserves in two installments 
the first payment was made in the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year the second payment was made subsequent to the end of fiscal year the company has recorded a non current asset in the form of an insurance receivable as of april  in accordance with its environmental accounting policies 
this transaction did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  nor did the transaction have a material effect on stockholders equity 
the company has been named as a defendant in civil actions by parties alleging damages from past exposure to toxic substances  generally asbestos  at closed former company facilities 
the company has approximately cases involving plaintiffs pending against it and other ship builders and repairers  ship owners  asbestos manufacturers  distributors and installers and equipment manufacturers  involving injuries or illnesses allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or other toxic substances 
the company and its insurers are vigorously defending these actions 
by their very nature  civil actions relating to toxic substances vary according to the cases fact patterns  jurisdiction and other factors 
potential additional future expenses related to alleged damages from past exposure to toxic substances is not quantifiable due to uncertainties of the number of cases  the extent of alleged damages  the population of claimants and size of any awards and or settlements 
accordingly  the company cannot predict the eventual number of such cases or their eventual resolution and does not include in its reserve amounts for cases that may be filed in the future 
the company has included an estimate of its potential liability for the known cases in its environmental reserves net of insurance recoveries 
the company spent million  net of insurance recoveries  in fiscal year for site remediation and other matters 
most of these expenditures were related to the shipyard and for judgments and settlements of civil matters relating to toxic substances 
while the company expects to spend larger amounts in future years  the timing of such expenditures is impossible to predict due largely to uncertainties relating to the cost associated with civil litigation involving the alleged exposure to asbestos containing products at the company s previously owned facilities 
the company s policy is to accrue costs for environmental matters in the accounting period in which the responsibility is established and the cost is estimable 
the company s estimates of its liabilities for environmental matters are based on evaluations of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and the results of negotiations with regulatory authorities 
the company does not discount these liabilities 
the company s balance sheet as of april  reflects reserves of million 
the company has recorded a non current asset of million to reflect contractual arrangements with several insurance companies to share costs for certain environmental matters
