item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sustained oil prices in the to bbl range throughout fiscal led to relatively robust levels of exploration spending on a global basis 
the deepwater regions in the gulf of mexico were particularly active 
in north america  natural gas prices as high as mcf led to high interest in gas prone areas such as the rocky mountain foothills 
brazil s opening of its offshore basins to foreign investment fueled significant interest there 
we were well positioned to take advantage of the increased spending and were able to exploit some new areas 
we performed extensive multi client surveys in the canadian rockies that were well funded by customers 
we performed contract and multi client work off brazil and the east coast of canada and we entered the canadian and alaskan arctic to acquire contract surveys 
in our established areas  we sold significant numbers of licenses to our gulf of mexico surveys and continued to have high utilization of our land crews in north america 
our processing centers throughout the world ran at capacity most of the year 
through the third quarter of fiscal we generated six consecutive quarters of earnings growth 
however  delays of certain large multi client sales during quarter four resulted in reduced quarterly profits  but still left us with annual earnings of almost three times those of the prior year 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the upturn in exploration spending driven by higher commodity prices 
multi client revenues increased from million to million  while contract revenues increased  from million to million 
contract revenue showed the stronger year on year increase due to our expansion into new market areas  such as alaska  the canadian arctic  offshore canada  and brazil 
operating income 
operating income increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of this million increase was due to the adjustment of receivable reserves 
these adjustments were made due to improved collection of past due receivables and the improved ability of a long term debtor to repay debt 
cost of services increased to from due to the increased percentage of lower margin contract revenue as described above 
research and development increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to higher numbers of employees dedicated to research and development 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the primary increases in cost were associated with the move to the new houston headquarters building  increased corporate marketing efforts and higher incentive compensation payments 
other income 
other income increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due partly to an additional million in interest income resulting from the higher cash balances in fiscal in addition  gains on sales of assets of million in fiscal were an improvement of million over the million loss on sales of assets experienced in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due to the increased profitability of the company 
the effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the general downturn in exploration spending driven by our customers concern that commodity prices would return to the low levels of prior years 
multi client revenues increased from million to million  while contract revenues decreased  from million to million 
multi client revenues as a percent of total revenues grew from in fiscal to in fiscal this reflects the trend in customer preference to obtain geophysical data through licensing rather than outright ownership 
operating income 
operating income declined by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of services was approximately of revenue in both years 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increased emphasis on leading edge technologies  including reservoir characterization 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal resulting from termination costs related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the issuance of million of senior notes at the end of october other income 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal other income was primarily composed of net foreign currency gains of million and interest income of million as compared with interest income of million in fiscal  due to lower cash balances during the year 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of our lower net income and the mix between us and us source income 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses our internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public financing  equity sales  the unutilized portion of a revolving credit facility  equipment financing and trade credit 
we believe that these sources of funds are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for fiscal as of july   we had million in senior notes outstanding due in october these notes contain a change of control provision allowing the holders to require us to call the notes under certain conditions 
we also have a revolving credit facility due august from commercial lenders that provides us advances up to million and us advances up to million 
advances bear interest  at our election  at libor plus a margin or prime rate plus a margin 
these margins are based on either certain of our financial ratios or our credit rating 
at july  the libor margin was and the prime rate margin was 
as of july   there were no outstanding advances under the credit facility  but million of the credit facility was utilized for letters of credit  leaving million available for borrowings 
we require significant amounts of working capital to support our operations and fund our research and development program 
our capital expenditure budget for fiscal is approximately million  which includes expenditures of approximately million to expand or upgrade our marine fleet 
we have planned million additional net investment in our data library measured as the change in the balance sheet account and planned million for research and development spending in fiscal we will require substantial cash flow to continue our investment in multi client library  complete our capital expenditure and research and development programs and meet our principal and interest obligations with respect to outstanding indebtedness 
while we believe that we have adequate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs  our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to many factors beyond our control 
key internal factors affecting future results include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library licensing  all of which are driven by the external factors of exploration spending and  ultimately  underlying commodity prices 
to ensure that we have available as many financing options as possible  we have filed a shelf registration allowing the issuance of up to million in debt  preferred stock or common stock 
on october   we filed a prospectus supplement relating to the sale of up to million shares of our common stock  from time to time through ordinary brokerage transactions  under the shelf registration 
as of july   we had issued approximately million shares in connection with these transactions  generating approximately million in net proceeds 
in october we sold million shares of stock in a public offering and netted million in proceeds 
other since our quasi reorganization on july  with respect to digicon inc  the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to additional paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
for the year ended july   we recognized million related to these benefits 
we receive some account receivable payments in foreign currency 
we currently do not conduct a hedging program because we do not consider our current exposure to foreign currency fluctuations to be significant  although we have hedged certain future charter payments to be made in a foreign currency 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have adopted the use of these new accounting statements 
the main effect of sfas no 
is to require purchase accounting be used in all future business combinations  disallowing the pooling of interests method allowed under apb opinion no 
sfas no 
defines the booking and subsequent treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets derived from business combinations and supercedes apb opinion no 
the adoption of this statement had no impact on our results 
this statement requires us to discontinue our amortization of goodwill and requires that we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in a specific manner on an annual basis or when certain events trigger such a test 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
disposal of long lived assets 
we will adopt the use of this accounting statement in fiscal we have not yet completed our evaluation of the effect of this statement on our accounting practices 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires us to record derivative financial instruments on our balance sheet as assets or liabilities  as appropriate  at fair value 
we adopted this statement in fiscal and there was no impact of adoption 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks discussed below 
you should carefully consider these discussions of risks and the other information included in this report 
as a provider of geophysical technologies  our business is substantially dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years 
these capital expenditures may also be affected by worldwide economic conditions 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies  as we have experienced in recent years  the demand for geophysical services likely will drop and there will be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period 
weak demand or technological obsolescence could impair the value of our multi client data library  changes in accounting practices could affect our methods of accounting for our multi client data library 
we have invested significant amounts in acquiring and processing multi client data and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will recover all the costs of such surveys 
technological  regulatory or other industry or general economic developments could render all or portions of our multi client data library obsolete or reduce its value 
in accordance with industry practice  we capitalize our investments in our multi client library and charge these investments to cost of services as sales are made 
certain accounting authorities are reviewing accounting practices relating to the capitalization of expenditures made in the development of certain data bases  particularly in the context of e commerce companies 
we cannot predict whether future accounting changes could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations 
we are dependent on achieving and maintaining technological advances  which creates risks regarding technological obsolescence  requirements for substantial future capital expenditures  the unavailability of necessary technology and the failure of new technologies 
the development of geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be required to invest substantial capital in the future to maintain our leading edge technology 
furthermore  manufacturers of geophysical equipment may develop new systems that render our equipment  even if recently acquired  obsolete or less desirable  requiring significant additional capital expenditures 
since some of our competitors are themselves leading designers and manufacturers of seismic equipment  we may not have access to their technology 
even if critical new and advanced equipment is available to us  we may not have funds available or be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms to acquire it 
further  any investment we may make in a perceived technological advance may not be effective  economically successful or otherwise accepted in the market 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could adversely affect our results 
competition among geophysical service providers historically has been  and will continue to be  intense 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
some of our competitors operate substantially more data acquisition crews than we do and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
these larger and better financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for contract awards and data sales and in the development of new technologies 
other competitors operate with extremely low overhead and compete vigorously on price in certain markets where that is the determining factor in awarding work 
these low cost competitors can have a competitive advantage over us in these markets 
high fixed costs could result in operating losses 
our business has high fixed costs 
as a result  downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand  weather interruptions  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses 
low utilization rates may hamper our ability to recover the cost of necessary capital investments 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period 
our operating results may  in the future  vary in material respects from quarter to quarter 
factors that could cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition  customers budgetary cycles  the timing of offshore lease sales and the effect of such timing on the demand for geophysical activities  seasonal factors and the timing of sales of geophysical data from our multi client data library  which may be significant to us and which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern 
combined with our high fixed costs  these revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any financial period 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry 
we may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel  particularly during periods of increased demand for geophysical services 
in addition  our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior management  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business 
we face risks associated with our foreign revenue generating activities 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from foreign activities and  as a result  significant portions of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
these revenues are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net assets reflected on the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore on our consolidated balance sheet  are subject to currency fluctuations 
foreign revenues are also subject to special risks that may disrupt markets  including the risk of war  terrorism  civil disturbances  embargo and government activities 
revenue generating activities in certain foreign countries may require prior united states government approval in the form of an export license and otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenues and  in particular  adverse effects from foreign currency fluctuations 
we operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personal injuries and may interrupt our business 
our seismic data acquisition activities involve operating under extreme weather and other hazardous conditions 
these operations are subject to risks of loss to property and injury to personnel from fires  accidental explosions  ice floes and high seas 
although we carry insurance against these risks in amounts we consider adequate  these events could result in an interruption of our business or significant liability 
we may not obtain insurance against all risks or for certain equipment located from time to time in certain areas of the world 
the trading price of our securities could be subject to significant fluctuations 
the trading price of our securities fluctuates 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial performance  and that of our competitors  as well as general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our securities 
the trading prices also may be affected by weakness in oil prices  changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control 
these factors may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
our business is subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect our future operations 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  provincial  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws 
we invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit requirements 
failure to timely obtain the required permits may result in crew downtime and operating losses 
because laws and regulations change frequently  we cannot predict the impact of government regulations on our future operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration by oil and gas companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our geophysical services 
certain provisions of our charter  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our stockholders 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock  and establish advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer  proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us  even if viewed favorably by stockholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk at july   we had limited market risk related to foreign currencies 
in march  we entered into a contract requiring payments in norwegian kroner to charter the seismic vessel m v seisquest 
the contract requires monthly payments commencing on june  to protect our exposure to exchange rate risk  we entered into multiple forward contracts as cash flow hedges fixing our exchange rates for norwegian kroner to the us dollar 
the total fair value of the open forward contracts at july  in us dollars is million 
at july   we had million of fixed rate debt maturing in october with a fair value of million based on the trading price of  with a yield to maturity of at july
