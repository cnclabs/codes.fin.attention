item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we develop and market software that integrates and analyzes information about customers  products and promotional activity  enabling our customers to improve their marketing  merchandising and advertising effectiveness 
our solutions harness the power of advanced data mining  reporting and campaign management capabilities to recommend specific actions intended to increase the profitability of marketers and merchants 
through december   we focused on providing solutions to electronic commerce and brick and mortar retailers  and most of our product revenues through december  were attributable to our net perceptions for e commerce product the predecessor to the personalization manager product and our net perceptions recommendation engine product  which is designed for other software and solution providers on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis 
in  we expanded our product suite by introducing new applications for internet sales channels and other markets  including net perceptions for call centers and net perceptions for knowledge management 
in we also introduced the net perceptions recommendation engine 
in the second quarter of  we recognized initial product revenues from our knowledge refinery and retail discovery suite products the successor products are now called the knowledge discovery engine and business intelligence engine  respectively which were acquired through our acquisition of kd discussed below 
net perceptions  inc was incorporated in delaware in july and our initial product was shipped in january since our inception through december   we expanded our organization by hiring personnel in key areas  particularly marketing  sales and research and development 
we grew from employees at december   to employees at december  and to employees at december  in october  the company reduced its workforce by employees  or about  to align the company s cost structure and skill sets more closely with its strategic direction and financial outlook 
as of december  we had employees 
in march  we announced a plan of restructuring  including a workforce reduction of approximately  or positions 
as a result of these reductions  we now have employees 
we estimate that we will recognize charges of between and million during the first quarter of for costs associated with this workforce reduction  consolidation of company facilities and other matters in connection with restructuring 
our products and services are sold worldwide through a direct sales force  original equipment manufacturers and resellers 
sales derived through indirect channels accounted for approximately of our total revenues compared to of our total revenues 
sales through indirect channels have lower average selling prices and gross margins than direct sales 
during the third quarter of  we renegotiated a license agreement with our primary original equipment manufacturer  effective november   which calls for a significant reduction of product license royalties in exchange for a significantly reduced license scope 
consequently  revenues through indirect channels are expected to decline in we license our products under various pricing plans  such as per stored profile  per user  per cpu  per site and per enterprise 
we grant licenses on both a term and perpetual basis 
license fees for our products range from  to in excess of  the price of our annual maintenance contracts is typically based on a percentage of the related product license price and is generally paid in advance 
professional service fees for implementation support and training are generally priced on a per hour or per class basis 
in addition  we offer some of our products on a hosted basis 
charges for hosted services vary across service offerings  but generally include an initial setup fee and a recurring monthly charge based on usage 
our revenues are recognized in accordance with the statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  deferral of the effective date of a provision of statement of position and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we derive revenues from software licenses  software maintenance and professional services 
maintenance includes telephone and web based technical support  bug fixes and rights to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
professional services include implementation  training and consulting  data warehousing and application provider services 
for software arrangements that include multiple software products  maintenance or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered maintenance and services elements  as determined by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the remaining residual arrangement fee is recognized as software product revenue 
for software arrangements in which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vendor specific objective evidence is determined for the undelivered elements or when all elements have been delivered 
revenues from license fees are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company implementation obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if we do not consider collection to be probable  then revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we recognize revenues allocable to maintenance on a straight line basis over the periods in which it is provided 
we evaluate arrangements that include professional and or data processing services to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
if professional services are considered essential  revenues from the arrangement are recognized using contract accounting  generally on a percentage of completion basis 
when we do not consider the professional services to be essential  we recognize the revenues allocable to the services as they are performed 
license revenues related to license terms of less than twenty four months are recognized ratably over the license term 
when we offer our products and services on a hosted basis  up front set up fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
we have sustained losses on a quarterly and annual basis since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million for the year ended december  including amortization of intangibles and non cash stock compensation expense of million compared to losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively including non cash stock compensation expense of million in and  in 
these losses resulted from significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services 
we anticipate that our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we also expect to incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future  and these losses may increase significantly from current levels 
we do not expect to achieve profitability including amortization of intangibles and stock compensation expense in our relatively limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in relatively new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
prior to the third quarter of  we experienced significant sequential percentage quarterly growth in revenues 
we do not believe that prior revenue growth rates are indicative of future growth rates 
the kd acquisition in february  we acquired kd  a developer and marketer of advanced data analysis solutions for multi channel retailers 
in this transaction  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of kd in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and kd became our wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  stock options of kd were converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the kd acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the purchase price of kd was allocated to the assets and liabilities that we acquired from kd as a result  non cash charges have been recorded against our operating results and will be recorded against our future operating results  which have and will continue to adversely affect our reported financial results 
we recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the kd acquisition which are being amortized over three to four years 
we recorded million of related amortization expense on these intangibles in and anticipate recording total amortization expense of million in  million in  million in and million in the first quarter of  under existing generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the unamortized intangible asset balances are subject to periodic impairment realizability analysis  which could accelerate these amortization amounts 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth certain items in the company s statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues product service and maintenance total revenues cost of revenues product service and maintenance total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative lease abandonment expense amortization of intangibles total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net net loss revenues total revenues 
revenues increased for the year ended december   to million  from million in revenues increased in from million in the increase in total revenues for all periods is primarily the result of increased sales of our net perceptions for e commerce the predecessor to the personalization manager product and net perceptions recommendation engine products 
in  the revenue increase was also attributable  to a lesser extent  to increased sales of our net perceptions for knowledge management  net perceptions for call centers  and net perceptions for marketing campaigns products which were introduced in  as well as to sales of retail discovery suite and knowledge refinery products acquired in the kd acquisition 
revenues from sales in the united states were million in compared to million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
revenues from international sales in were million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues  in and  or of total revenues  in the majority of international sales were made in europe and asia by our direct sales organizations based in the united states and the united kingdom 
international sales are generally denominated in united states dollars 
revenues from one customer represented of our total revenues in both and in  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
product revenues 
product revenues increased to million in from million in product revenues in increased from million in the growth of product revenues in absolute dollars is attributable to an increase in the average size of license transactions recognized and increased sales and marketing efforts  specifically the expansion of both our direct and indirect sales and distribution channels 
based upon economic uncertainty in early  we anticipate that customers may defer purchasing decisions and  thus  product revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues 
in addition  we expect that prior percentage growth rates of our product revenues will not be sustainable in the future 
while product revenues increased on a year over year basis  third and fourth quarter product revenues declined on a sequential quarterly basis  decreasing from million in the second quarter of to million in the third quarter of  and decreasing to million in the fourth quarter of these decreases were attributable to a combination of factors  including the rapid deterioration of the pure dot com e tailer  a lengthening of the sales cycle for multi channel retailers  increased competition and unanticipated delays in the requisite training of field sales personnel and in product implementation  integration and promotion 
this decline in product revenues contributed to management s decision in october to reduce the company s workforce by employees 
as a result of continued declines in product revenues during the first quarter of  we announced  in march  a plan of restructuring 
the plan includes a reduction in workforce of approximately  or positions 
we believe that the continued decline in revenues during the first quarter of is the result of the deferral of purchase decisions by our current and potential customers due to economic uncertainty 
service and maintenance revenues 
service and maintenance revenues consist primarily of professional and maintenance services and hosted product related services 
our professional service revenues include business consulting  implementation support  data warehousing and processing and educational services and are generally offered on a time and materials basis 
maintenance revenues are generally derived from annual service agreements and are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
total service and maintenance revenues increased in to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues  in service and maintenance revenues increased in from  or of total revenues  in all increases reflect higher levels of consulting service and maintenance support revenues connected with a growing installed base 
we expect that prior percentage growth rates of our service and maintenance revenues will not be sustainable in the future 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of royalties paid to third party vendors  amortization of acquired technology costs  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expenses 
cost of product revenues increased to million in from  in  and increased in from  in cost of product revenues represented  and of related product revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of product revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total product revenues from to is primarily attributable to amortization of acquired technology and royalties in connection with the acquisition of kd the increase in cost of product revenues from to is primarily attributable to increased royalties payable to vendors and higher volumes of product shipped 
since all internal development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products were expensed as incurred  cost of product revenues includes no amortization of capitalized software development costs 
we believe that the cost of product revenues will be relatively flat as a percentage of product revenues in cost of service and maintenance revenues 
cost of service and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel related and infrastructure costs incurred in providing telephone and web based support of our software products  as well as professional  consulting  educational and hosted product related services to customers 
cost of service and maintenance revenues increased to million in from million in  and increased in from  in cost of service and maintenance revenues in  and represented  and of the related services and maintenance revenues  respectively 
the increase in cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues is due primarily to staff increases and the related recruiting and training costs associated with increased personnel in our service organization  lower than planned utilization of our consultants  and increased costs for third party contractors used to staff consulting engagements 
cost of service and maintenance revenues may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon the mix of services that we provide and the utilization rate of our service personnel 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  commissions and other incentive compensation  travel and entertainment and expenditures for marketing programs such as collateral materials  trade shows  public relations and creative services 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
sales and marketing expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the overall increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts reflects the cost of hiring additional sales and marketing personnel  developing and expanding our sales and distribution channels  launching new products and expanding promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs and consulting fees relating to the development of our products 
research and development expenses were million in  an increase of from the million in research and development expenses in research and development expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in both and was primarily due to the cost of hiring additional research and development personnel for the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products

general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from million in general and administrative expenses increased in from million in as a percent of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollar amounts reflects the cost of hiring additional general and administrative personnel  increased professional fees  additional provision for doubtful accounts and additional infrastructure to support our expanding operations 
lease abandonment expense 
we recorded lease abandonment expense totaling approximately million in  representing of total revenues 
this charge reflects estimated lease abandonment expenses related to the company s august move to new corporate headquarters 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles related to goodwill and other intangibles acquired in the acquisition of kd was million in including amortization of million included in cost of product revenues  or of total revenues 
amortization charges in connection with the kd acquisition will continue into early stock compensation expense

net other income was million in  up from net other income of million in net other income was  in the increase in net other income in both and is due primarily to interest income on the proceeds from two public stock offerings 
our initial public offering ipo was completed in april and may and our follow on public offering was completed in march see additional discussion under liquidity and capital resources below 
provision for income taxes we have incurred significant operating losses for all periods from inception through december  as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income expiring at various dates beginning in in addition  as of december   we had  of tax credit carry forwards expiring at various dates beginning in under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if certain substantial changes in our ownership were to occur  we could be limited in the future in the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards that could be utilized annually to offset future taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  as the realization of the future tax benefit is presently not likely

at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  in march we completed our follow on public stock offering  selling  shares of common stock at a price of per share  raising a total of million in net proceeds after payment of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
cash used in operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operations in all years resulted primarily from net losses  as adjusted for non cash expenses 
other significant changes to working capital in included a net million pay down of accounts payable and million growth in other assets  offset in part by the net collection of accounts and royalties receivable and growth in accrued liabilities 
we used million in net cash for investing activities for the year ended december   compared to million in and million net cash provided by investing activities in our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
to date  we have not invested in financial instruments that involve a high level of complexity or risk 
we will continue to invest cash in excess of current requirements in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the receipt of net proceeds from the company s follow on public stock offering 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  reflecting the million of net proceeds from the company s ipo and borrowings under a short term convertible note payable 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  due primarily to the sale of preferred stock 
capital expenditures were million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures include leasehold improvements and purchases of property and equipment  primarily computer equipment  software and furniture for our growing employee base and expanding operations infrastructure 
in april  we signed a ten year lease for a new corporate facility in edina  minnesota  with annual total rent payments beginning at million per year  excluding operating expenses 
as a result  we will incur increased rent expense in the future 
the move to the new headquarters facility was completed in august and required a net investment of approximately million in leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment 
at december   we had no material long term commitments for capital expenditures 
since  we have purchased property and equipment with cash balances 
from inception through  we generally funded the purchase of property and equipment with capital leases 
at december   we had million in short and long term liabilities  of which approximately million was deferred rent credits 
approximately  represents loans and notes payable  consisting primarily of capital lease obligations 
these obligations include installment loans with third party financing sources that are secured by the equipment financed by the third parties 
the loans bear interest at rates between and and mature between november and august we believe that existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds in order to support more rapid expansion of our sales force  develop new or enhanced products or services  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we seek to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain funds on terms which are favorable or otherwise acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then existing stockholders would be reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk through december   substantially all of our recognized revenues were denominated in united states dollars and primarily from customers in the united states  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that future product license and service revenues may also be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future 
our exposure to market risk is otherwise limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by corporations 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we believe that a decline in the average yield of our investments would adversely impact our net interest income 
we do not believe  however  that a decline would have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations or cash flows 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments
