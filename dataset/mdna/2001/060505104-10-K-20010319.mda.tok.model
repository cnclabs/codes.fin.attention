risk ratings are adjusted as necessary and the corporation seeks to reduce exposure in such situations where appropriate 
for consumer and small business lending  credit scoring systems are utilized to determine the relative riskiness of new underwritings and provide standards for extensions of credit 
consumer portfolio credit risk is monitored primar ily using statistical models and reviews of actual payment experience in an attempt to predict portfolio behavior

allowance for credit losses the corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolios to identify inherent risks and to assess the overall collectibility of those portfolios 
the allowance on certain homogeneous loan portfolios  which generally consist of consumer loans  is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by loan type 
loss forecast models are utilized for these segments which consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  anticipated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends  delinquencies and credit scores  and expected loss factors by loan type 
the remaining portfolios are reviewed on an individual loan basis 
loans subject to individual reviews are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the corporation s internal risk rating scale 
these risk classifications  in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends within specific portfolio segments  and any other pertinent information including individual valuations on nonperforming loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan result in the estimation of specific allowances for credit losses 
the corporation has procedures in place to monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred credit losses 
these procedures include detailed periodic assessments by senior man agement of both individual loans and credit portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred credit losses in those portfolios 
portions of the allowance for credit losses  as presented on table fifteen  are assigned to cover the estimated probable incurred credit losses in each loan and lease category based on the results of the corporation s detail review process described above 
the assigned portion continues to be weighted toward the commercial loan portfolio  which reflects a higher level of nonperforming loans and the potential for higher individual losses 
the remaining or unassigned portion of the allowance for credit losses  determined separately from the procedures outlined above  addresses certain industry and geographic concentrations  including global economic conditions 
this procedure helps to minimize the risk related to the margin of imprecision inherent in the estimation of the assigned allowances for credit losses 
due to the subjectivity involved in the determination of the unassigned portion of the allowance for credit losses  the relationship of the unassigned component to the total allowance for credit losses may fluctu ate from period to period 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses based on the combined total of the assigned and unassigned components and believes that the allowance for credit losses reflects manage ment s best estimate of incurred credit losses as of the balance sheet date 
the provision for credit losses increased million in to bil lion primarily related to increased credit deterioration and nonperforming assets in the commercial domestic loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses in was million in excess of net charge offs of billion due primarily to a decision to increase the allowance for credit losses  in response to the increased velocity of credit deterioration in the fourth quar ter of the nature of the process by which the corporation determines the appropri ate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judg ment 
after review of all relevant matters affecting loan collectibility  management believes that the allowance for credit losses is appropriate given its analysis of estimated incurred credit losses at december  table thirteen provides the changes in the allowance for credit losses for the five years ended december  table thirteen allowance for credit losses dollars in millions balance  january      loans and leases charged off commercial domestic  commercial foreign commercial real estate domestic commercial real estate foreign total commercial   residential mortgage home equity lines direct indirect consumer consumer finance bankcard  other consumer domestic foreign consumer total consumer      total loans and leases charged off      recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off commercial domestic commercial foreign commercial real estate domestic commercial real estate foreign total commercial residential mortgage home equity lines direct indirect consumer consumer finance bankcard other consumer domestic foreign consumer total consumer total recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off net charge offs      provisions for credit losses      other  net balance  december      loans and leases outstanding at december      allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at december average loans and leases outstanding during the year      net charge offs as a percentage of average outstanding loans and leases during the year

market risk management overview the corporation is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
examples of these business activities include market making  underwriting  proprietary trading  and asset liability management in interest rate  foreign exchange  equity  commod ity and credit markets  along with any associated derivative products 
market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices and liquidity 
financial products that expose the corporation to market risk include securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments such as futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
liquidity risk arises from the pos sibility that the corporation may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or that the corporation may be more reliant on alterna tive funding sources such as long term debt 
trading portfolio the corporation s board of directors the board delegates responsibility of the day to day management of market risk to the finance committee 
the finance committee has structured a system of independent checks  balances and report ing in order to ensure that the board s disposition toward market risk is not compromised 
the objective of risk management is to provide senior management with inde pendent  timely assessments of the bottom line impacts of all market risks facing the corporation and to monitor those impacts against trading limits 
risk management monitors the changing aggregate position of the corporation and projects the profit and loss levels that would result from both normal and extreme market moves 
in addition  risk management is responsible for ensuring that reasonable policies and procedures that are in line with the board s risk preferences are in place and enforced 
these policies and procedures encompass the limit process  risk reporting  new product review and model review 
daily market risk related number revenue dollars in millions of days to to to market risk related revenue includes trading revenue and trading related net interest income  which encompasses both proprietary trading and customer related activities 
in  the corporation continued its efforts to build on its client franchise and reduce the proportion of proprietary trading revenue to total revenue 
the success of these efforts can be seen in the histogram 
in  the corporation recorded positive daily market risk related revenue for of trading days 
furthermore  of the days that showed negative revenue  only one day was greater than million 
value at risk value at risk var is the key measure of market risk for the corporation 
var represents the maximum amount that the corporation has placed at risk of loss  with a percent degree of confidence  in the course of its risk taking activities 
its purpose is to describe the amount of capital required to absorb potential losses from adverse market movements 
as the graph below shows  in  actual market risk related revenue exceeded var measures one day out of total trading days 
given the per cent confidence interval captured by var  this would be expected to occur approximately once every trading days  or two to three times each year 
graphic omitted line graph representation of daily market risk related revenue and var for the twelve months ended december  during  the daily market risk related revenue ranged from negative revenue of million to positive revenue of million 
over the same period  var ranged from million to million

the high and low for the entire trading account may not equal the sum of the individual components as the highs or lows of the portfolio may have occurred on different trading days 
the decrease in var in the fourth quarter was due to a change in the meth odology used to calculate var for the equities portfolio 
the net effect of the change was an approximate million reduction in reported var for equities 
var was not restated for previous quarters 
var modeling on trading is subject to numerous limitations 
in addition  the corporation recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates asso ciated with modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates 
the corporation mitigates these uncertainties through close monitoring and by examining and updating assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the continual trading risk management process considers the impact of unantici pated risk exposure and updates assumptions to reduce loss exposure 
stress testing in order to determine the sensitivity of the corporation s capital to the impact of historically large market moves with low probability  stress scena rios are run against the trading portfolios 
this stress testing should verify that  even under extreme market moves  the corporation will preserve its capi tal 
the scenarios for each product are large standard deviation moves in the relevant markets that are based on significant historical events 
these results are calculated daily and reported as part of the regular reporting process 
in addition  specific stress scenarios are run regularly which represent extreme  but plausible  events that would be of concern given the corpora tion s current portfolio 
the results of these specific scenarios are pre sented to the trading risk committee as part of its regular meetings 
examples of these specific stress scenarios include calculating the effects on the overall portfolio of an extreme federal reserve board tightening or easing of interest rates  a severe credit deterioration in the us  and a recession in japan and the corresponding ripple effects throughout asia 
asset and liability management activities non trading portfolio the corporation s asset and liability management alm process  managed through the asset and liability committee of the finance committee  is used to manage interest rate risk through the structuring of balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios and identifying and linking such off balance sheet positions to specific assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk represents the only material market risk exposure to the corporation s non trading finan cial instruments 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses sophisticated computer simulations which determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instru ments short term financial instruments  securities  loans  deposits  borrowings and off balance sheet financial instruments 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these scena rios  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are devel oped and implemented 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management 
additionally  duration and market value sensitivity measures are selectively utilized where they pro vide added value to the overall interest rate risk management process 
at december   the interest rate risk position of the corporation was relatively neutral as the impact of a gradual parallel basis point rise or fall in interest rates over the next months was estimated to be less than one percent of net interest income 
table twenty one summarizes the expected maturities  unrealized gains and losses and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with the corporation s significant non trading on balance sheet financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  time deposits placed and other short term invest ments  federal funds sold and purchased  resale and repurchase agreements  commercial paper  other short term borrowings and foreign deposits  which are similar in nature to other short term borrowings  are excluded from table twenty one as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
loans held for sale are also excluded as their carrying values approximate their fair values  generally exposing the corporation to insignif icant market risk

when measuring and managing market risk associated with domestic deposits  such as savings and demand deposits  the corporation considers its long term relationships with depositors 
the unrealized gain loss on deposits in this table does not consider these long term relationships  therefore only certificates of deposits reflect a change in value 
excludes foreign time deposits 
expected maturities of long term debt and trust preferred securities reflect the corporation s ability to redeem such debt prior to contractual maturities

unrealized losses on available for sale securities are included in the book value 
interest rate and foreign exchange contracts risk management interest rate contracts and foreign exchange contracts are utilized in the alm process 
interest rate contracts  which are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps  options  futures and for wards  allow the corporation to effectively manage its interest rate risk position 
generic interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amount 
basis swaps involve the exchange of interest payments based on the contractual underlying notional amounts  where both the pay rate and the receive rate are floating rates based on different indices 
option products primarily consist of caps and floors 
interest rate caps and floors are agree ments where  for a fee  the purchaser obtains the right to receive interest payments when a variable interest rate moves above or below a specified cap or floor rate  respectively 
futures contracts used for alm activities are pri marily index futures providing for cash payments based upon the movements of an underlying rate index 
in addition  the corporation uses foreign currency contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denomi nated assets and liabilities  as well as the corporation s equity investments in foreign subsidiaries 
foreign exchange contracts  which include spot  futures and forward contracts  represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed upon price  on an agreed upon date 
table twenty two shows the notional amount of the corporation s open inter est rate and foreign exchange contracts 
the notional amount of the corpora tion s receive fixed and pay fixed interest rate swaps at december  was billion and billion  respectively 
the receive fixed interest rate swaps are primarily converting variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate

unrealized gains and losses are based on the last repricing and will change in the future primarily based on movements in one  three and six month libor rates

the amount of unamortized net realized deferred gains associated with closed alm options was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount of unamortized net realized deferred losses associated with closed alm futures and forward contracts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
there were no unamor tized net realized deferred gains or losses associated with closed foreign exchange contracts at december  and management believes the fair value of the alm interest rate and foreign exchange portfolios should be viewed in the context of the overall balance sheet  and the value of any single component of the balance sheet or off bal ance sheet positions should not be viewed in isolation
