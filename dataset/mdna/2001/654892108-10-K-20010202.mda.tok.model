while nobility actively seeks to make wholesale sales to independent retail dealers  its presence as a competitor limits potential sales to dealers located in the same geographic areas serviced by its prestige sales centers 
nobility also makes sales to the retirement community market  which is made up of retirees moving to florida and typically purchasing homes to be located on sites leased from park communities offering a variety of amenities

nobility has a product line of approximately active models 
although market demand can fluctuate on a fairly short term basis  the manufacturing process is such that nobility can alter its product mix relatively quickly in response to changes in the market 
during fiscal  and  nobility s product mix was affected by the special edition homes marketed by prestige and by larger  more expensive multi wide homes resulting from greater consumer confidence and the availability of varied types of financing at competitive rates 
many family buyers today purchase three  four or five bedroom manufactured homes  compared with the two bedroom home that typically appeals to the retirement community market 
nobility s majestic joint venture with st century mortgage corporation provides mortgage financing to retail customers who purchase nobility s manufactured homes at prestige retail sales centers 
this joint venture  which originates and services loans  has given prestige more control over the financing aspect of the retail home sales process and allowed it to offer better service to its retail customers

in an effort to make manufactured homes more competitive with site built housing  financing packages are available to provide year financing  an interest rate reduction program  combination land manufactured home loans  and a down payment program for qualified buyers

results of operations total net sales in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal compared to the prior year  net sales declined in fiscal and in fiscal as compared to an increase of in fiscal the decline in sales from the comparable period in fiscal was primarily due to a very competitive market caused by the industry s excess retail inventory 
the excess inventory has developed from industry growth of new retail locations that has outpaced consumer demand 
tighter credit standards  increasing mortgage interest rates and management s decision not to discount homes to maintain sales volume also adversely impacted sales 
in the near term  we anticipate continued pressure on both sales and earnings resulting from these factors  but remain convinced that our specific geographic market is one of the best long term growth areas
