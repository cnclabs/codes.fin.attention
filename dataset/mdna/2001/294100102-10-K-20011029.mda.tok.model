the increase in research product sales resulted primarily from and an increase in direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets 
the cost of clinical laboratory services increased by million primarily due to an increase in direct operating expenses based on the increased sales volume of testing in fiscal in addition  the cost of sales for research products decreased by 
million as a result of a change in the revenue mix from two of the company s non exclusive distribution agreements

million primarily as a result of an increase in operating expenses based on the increased sales in fiscal and the cost of sales for research products decreased by

research and development expenses increased by approximately million as a result of an increase in research programs and the increased amortization of patent costs 
our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable increased by million  primarily due to increased revenues from our clinical reference laboratory and reduced reimbursements received from medicare and other third party insurers who generally follow the reimbursement policies of medicare
