item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of manchester should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of securities act of as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  which are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in those forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those set forth below and the risk factors described in the company s other filings from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
general we are an integrator and reseller of computer hardware  software and networking products  primarily for commercial customers 
we offer our customers single source solutions customized to their information systems needs by integrating analysis  design and implementation services with hardware  software  networking products and peripherals from leading vendors 
to date  most of our revenues have been derived from product sales 
we generally do not develop or sell software products 
however  certain computer hardware products sold by us are loaded with prepackaged software products 
the computer industry is characterized by a number of potentially adverse business conditions  including pricing pressures  evolving distribution channels  market consolidation and a decline in the rate of growth in sales of personal computers 
heightened price competition among various hardware manufacturers may result in reduced per unit revenue and declining gross profit margins 
as a result of the intense price competition within our industry  we have experienced increasing pressure on our gross profit and operating margins with respect to our sale of products 
our inability to compete successfully on the pricing of products sold  or a continuing decline in gross margins on products sold due to adverse industry conditions or competition  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an integral part of our strategy is to increase our value added services revenue 
these services generally provide higher operating margins than those associated with the sale of products 
this strategy requires us  among other things  to attract and retain highly skilled technical employees in a competitive labor market  provide additional training to our sales representatives and enhance our existing service management system 
we can t predict whether we will be successful in increasing our focus on providing value added services  and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our strategy also includes expanding our presence in the new york metropolitan area by increasing our sales and service capabilities in our new york city office and enlarging our sales  service and training capabilities at our long island headquarters as well as expanding geographically into growing business centers in the eastern half of the united states 
we can t assure you that the expansion of our new york metropolitan area operations will increase profits generated by such operations  that the opening of new offices will prove profitable  or that these expansion plans will not substantially increase future capital expenditures or other expenditures 
the failure of this component of our strategy may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  our success has been based primarily upon sales in the new york metropolitan area 
our strategy  encompassing the expansion of service offerings  the expansion of existing offices and the establishment of new regional offices  has challenged and will continue to challenge our senior management and infrastructure 
we cannot predict our ability to respond to these challenges 
if we fail to effectively manage our planned growth  there may be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
on september   the world trade center in new york city and the pentagon in washington  dc were the subject of terrorists attacks 
although a significant part of our business is generated from our new york city and baltimore washington  dc offices  we are not aware of any material impact on our business as a result of these attacks 
we cannot predict the impact that these or potential future attacks may have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the success of our strategy depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical personnel and sales representatives  including independent sales representatives  in a very competitive labor market 
our ability to grow our service offerings has been somewhat limited by a shortage of qualified personnel  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such skilled personnel and representatives 
the loss of a significant number of our existing technical personnel or sales representatives  difficulty in hiring or retaining additional technical personnel or sales representatives  or reclassification of our sales representatives as employees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the computer industry is characterized by intense competition 
we directly compete with local  regional and national systems integrators  value added resellers and distributors as well as with certain computer manufacturers that market through direct sales forces and or the internet 
the computer industry has recently experienced a significant amount of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions  and manufacturers of personal computers may increase competition by offering a range of services in addition to their current product and service offerings 
in the future  we may face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances between existing competitors 
moreover  additional suppliers and manufacturers may choose to market products directly to end users through a direct sales force and or the internet rather than or in addition to channel distribution  and may also choose to market services  such as repair and configuration services  directly to end users 
some of our competitors have or may have  greater financial  marketing and other resources  and may offer a broader range of products and services  than us 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements  benefit from greater purchasing economies  offer more aggressive hardware and service pricing or devote greater resources to the promotion of their products and services 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other current or potential competitors 
our business is dependent upon our relationships with major manufacturers and distributors in the computer industry 
many aspects of our business are affected by our relationships with major manufacturers  including product availability  pricing and related terms  and reseller authorizations 
the increasing demand for personal computers and ancillary equipment has resulted in significant product shortages from time to time  because manufacturers have been unable to produce sufficient quantities of certain products to meet demand 
we cannot predict that manufacturers will maintain an adequate supply of these products to satisfy all the orders of our customers or that  during periods of increased demand  manufacturers will provide products to us  even if available  or at discounts previously offered to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the pricing and related terms offered by major manufacturers will not adversely change in the future 
our failure to obtain an adequate supply of products  the loss of a major manufacturer  the deterioration of our relationship with a major manufacturer or our inability in the future to develop new relationships with other manufacturers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on september   hewlett packard company and compaq computer corporation announced their intention to merge 
manchester sells the products of both companies and we believe that we have strong relationships with both companies 
while we do not believe that there will be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as a result of this merger  there can be no assurance that such a material adverse effect will not occur 
certain manufacturers offer market development funds  cooperative advertising and other promotional programs to systems integrators  distributors and computer resellers 
we rely on these funds for many of our advertising and promotional campaigns 
in recent years  manufacturers have generally reduced their level of support with respect to these programs  which has required us to increase spending of our own funds to obtain the same level of advertising and promotion 
if manufacturers continue to reduce their level of support for these programs  or discontinue them altogether  we would have to further increase our advertising and promotion spending  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability has been affected by our ability to obtain volume discounts from certain manufacturers  which has been dependent  in part  upon our ability to sell large quantities of products to computer resellers  including value added resellers 
our sales to resellers have been made at profit margins generally less favorable than our sales directly to commercial customers 
our inability to sell products to computer resellers and thereby obtain the desired volume discounts from manufacturers or to expand our sales to commercial customers sufficiently to offset our need to rely on sales to computer resellers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent introduction of new hardware and software products and services 
this may render many existing products and services noncompetitive  less profitable or obsolete 
our continued success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the technological developments of new products and services and to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
our success will also depend upon our abilities to address the technical requirements of our customers arising from new generations of computer technologies  to obtain these new products from present or future suppliers and vendors at reasonable costs  to educate and train our employees as well as our customers with respect to these new products or services and to integrate effectively and efficiently these new products into both our internal systems and systems developed for our customers 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing product and service developments or enhancements in response to these technological changes 
our failure to respond effectively to these technological changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid product improvement and technological change characterize the computer industry 
this results in relatively short product life cycles and rapid product obsolescence  which can place inventory at considerable valuation risk 
certain of our suppliers provide price protection to us  which is intended to reduce the risk of inventory devaluation due to price reductions on current products 
certain of our suppliers also provide stock balancing to us pursuant to which we are able to return unsold inventory to a supplier as a partial credit against payment for new products 
there are often restrictions on the dollar amount of inventory that we can return at any one time 
price protection and stock balancing may not be available to us in the future  and  even if available  these measures may not provide complete protection against the risk of excess or obsolete inventories 
certain manufacturers have reduced the period for which they provide price protection and stock balancing rights 
although we maintain a sophisticated proprietary inventory management system  we can t assure you that we will continue to successfully manage our existing and future inventory 
our failure to successfully manage our current or future inventory may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our strategy envisions that part of our future growth will come from acquisitions consistent with our strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and  once identified  to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us  or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
certain of these acquisitions may be of significant size and may include assets that are outside our geographic territories or are ancillary to our core business strategy 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
quarterly revenue and operating results generally fluctuate as a result of the demand for our products and services  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies with improved features  the introduction of new services by us and our competitors  changes in the level of our operating expenses  competitive conditions and economic conditions 
in particular  we have increased certain of our fixed operating expenses  including a significant increase in personnel  as part of our strategy to increase our focus on providing systems integration and other higher margin and value added services 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
as a result of the rapid changes which are taking place in computer and networking technologies  product life cycles are short 
accordingly  our product offerings change constantly 
prices of products change with generally higher prices early in the life cycle of the product and lower prices near the end of the product s life cycle 
the computer industry has experienced rapid declines in average selling prices of personal computers 
in some instances  we have been able to offset these price declines with increases in units shipped 
there can be no assurance that average selling prices will not decline or that we will be able to offset declines in average selling prices with increases in units shipped 
most of the personal computers we sell utilize operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
the united states department of justice has brought a successful antitrust action against microsoft  which could delay the introduction and distribution of microsoft products 
the potential unavailability of microsoft products could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we lease certain warehouses and offices from entities that are owned or controlled by our majority shareholder 
each of the leases with related parties has been amended effective with the closing of our initial public offering in december to reduce the rent payable under that lease to then current market rates 
e commerce we utilize a website and electronic commerce system 
the site  located at www 
e manchester 
com allows both existing customers  corporate shoppers and others to find product specifications  compare products  check price and availability and place and track orders quickly and easily hours a day seven days a week 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  significant investments and improvements in our e commerce capabilities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enhancing and increasing our business through our expanded internet presence

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information derived from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of related revenue or total revenue 
percentage of revenue the year ended july  revenue products services cost of revenue products services product gross profit services gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue 
our revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in revenue was and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  compared to the same quarters a year ago  respectively  reflecting the overall slowdown in economic activity in general as well as the decline in corporate spending in the technology industry in particular 
revenue from product sales decreased by million  or  as a result of lower selling prices for personal computers partially offset by a increase in the number of personal computers sold as well as increased revenue from the sales of large screen flat panel displays by our electrograph subsidiary 
service revenue increased by million  or  due to our continued focus on developing and selling value added services to our customers including significant growth in the sales of services to customers that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors 
gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the direct costs of products sold  freight and the personnel costs associated with providing technical services  offset in part by certain market development funds provided by manufacturers 
all other operating costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross profit decreased by million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of the decline in revenue discussed above 
as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of products increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit from the sale of services declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of lower margin services that are delivered by manufacturers or vendors as well as reduced demand for higher margin consulting and network design services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is principally due to higher bad debts and depreciation and amortization costs as well as costs from our rochester office which was opened in connection with the acquisitions of texport and ltg on march  these increases were partially offset by lower commission costs due to the lower revenue discussed above 
in addition  selling  general and administrative costs were lower in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal when compared to the same quarters a year ago  reflecting the cost cutting measures principally personnel costs that have been instituted as a result of the reduction in revenue 
other income 
interest and investment income  net  declined by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal principally due to lower interest rates earned on short term investments as well as lower cash balances available for investment 
other income  net in fiscal consists of approximately  proceeds received by the company in connection with a life insurance policy that it carried on a deceased employee  partially offset by approximately  in compensation benefits paid to the deceased employee s beneficiary principally under the terms of a deferred compensation agreement with the employee 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased from of pre tax income in fiscal to of pre tax income in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of nontaxable life insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of fiscal as discussed in other income above partially offset by higher state and local income taxes 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  revenue 
our revenue increased million or from million in fiscal to million for fiscal revenue from product sales increased by million primarily due to higher revenue generated from the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  electrograph systems  inc electrograph and texport technology group  inc 
texport  which was acquired on march   as well as increases in the number of personal computers shipped and higher average selling prices for personal computers 
services revenue increased by  or  reflecting our continued emphasis on providing services 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million or from million for fiscal to million for fiscal gross profit from the sale of products increased by million or due primarily to increases in revenue partially offset by generally lower margins on products resulting from the highly competitive environment for computer products 
gross profit generated through service offerings increased by  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase primarily relates to higher operating and personnel costs at electrograph and coastal as well as operating costs from texport which was acquired on march  in addition  we incurred higher advertising  depreciation and commission costs in fiscal partially offset by a recovery of bad debt expenses 
other income 
interest income increased due to higher cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to the lower percentage of non taxable interest income and the non deductible amortization of goodwill to the current year taxable income as compared to that of the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources cash and cash equivalents in fiscal have been internally generated working capital from profitable operations and a line of credit from financial institutions 
for the year ended july   cash provided by operating activities was  consisting primarily of net income adjusted for non cash charges principally depreciation and amortization  and decreases in accounts receivable partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in inventory 
our accounts receivable and accounts payable balances  as well as our investment in inventory  can fluctuate significantly from one period to the next due to the receipt of large customer orders or payments or variations in product availability and vendor shipping patterns at any particular date 
generally  our experience is that increases in accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses will coincide with growth in revenue and increased operating levels 
during the year ended july   we used approximately million for capital expenditures and approximately  was used to purchase and retire common stock 
we have available a line of credit with financial institutions in the aggregate amount of million 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under this line 
we believe that our current balances in cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the lines of credit will be adequate to support current operating levels for the foreseeable future  specifically through at least the end of fiscal we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
future capital requirements include those for the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventory  the purchase of equipment  expansion of facilities  potential contingent acquisition payments of  as well as the possible opening of new offices and potential acquisitions 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combinations must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
statement will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement statement will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of statement immediately and has elected to adopt statement effective august  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre statement accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will not be amortized after august  statement will require upon adoption of statement  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in statement for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of statement  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  statement will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of income 
as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  which will be subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was for the year ended july  because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting statements and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operations
