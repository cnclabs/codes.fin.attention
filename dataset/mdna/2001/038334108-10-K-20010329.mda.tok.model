net loss per share 
net loss per share increased to in  from in this increase in the loss per share is the result of higher operating expenses as the company expanded its business and interest expense related to a charge for the fair market value of warrants issued in connection with financing arrangements

the company s operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in  million in  and million in the operating cash outflows for these periods resulted from net losses experienced in each of the periods as the company continued to invest in product development and expansion of its sales force and infrastructure to support growth

the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
the company expects to devote substantial resources to continue research and development efforts  expand sales channels  increase marketing programs  fund capital expenditures  and provide for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that the net proceeds from the sale of the common shares in the company s ipo will be sufficient to meet the working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company may also need to raise additional funds in order to fund more rapid expansion  including significant increases in personnel and office facilities  to develop new or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures 
additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all

cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  apropos has adopted fin no 
and the application of fin no 
did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
while inflation has not had a material impact on operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
risk factors associated with apropos business and future operating results apropos future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of the company s common shares has and will fluctuate in the future  and an investment in the company s common shares is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in the company s securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell the company s securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this annual report 
risks related to the company s business the company s limited operating history makes evaluating the company s business difficult 
the company s limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast its future operating results 
the company commenced operations in january  but did not begin shipping its principal product and generating revenue from that product until march therefore  the company has only a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate its business 
prospective and existing investors must consider the numerous risks and uncertainties an early stage company like apropos faces in a rapidly changing software and technology industry 
these risks include the company s inability to increase awareness of its brand and continue to build client loyalty  maintain its current  and develop new  strategic partnerships and relationships  respond effectively to competitive pressures  and continue to develop and improve its technology to meet the needs of its clients 
if the company is unsuccessful in addressing these risks  sales of its product and services  as well as its ability to maintain or increase its client base  will be substantially diminished 
the company has not been profitable since the company has not operated profitably since the company incurred net losses of million in  million in  and million in the company intends to continue to make significant investments in its research and development  marketing  and sales operations 
the company anticipates that these expenses could significantly precede any revenues generated by the increased spending 
as a result  the company may experience losses and negative cash flow from its operations in future periods 
the company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability and it may not be able to do so 
even if it does achieve profitability  the company makes no assurance that it will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company has never been able to fully fund operations from cash generated by its business  and it may not be able to do so in the future 
the company has not operated profitably since the company has principally financed its operations through the private placement of convertible preferred shares  bank borrowings  short term loans  and most recently through its ipo 
if the company does not generate sufficient cash resources from its business to fund operations  its growth could be limited unless it is able to obtain additional capital through equity or debt financings 
the company s inability to grow as planned may reduce its chances of achieving profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common shares 
the company s lengthy sales cycle has contributed and may continue to contribute to the quarter to quarter variability and unpredictability of its revenue and operating results which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares 
the company has generally experienced a lengthy product sales cycle  averaging approximately six to nine months 
the company considers the life of the sales cycle to begin on the first face to face meeting with the prospective client and end when the product is delivered 
the company s prospective clients decisions to license its product often requires significant investment and executive level decision making  and depend on a number of factors 
the lengthy sales cycle is one of the factors that has caused  and may in the future continue to cause  the company s software revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which makes it difficult for the company to forecast software license revenue and could cause volatility in the market price of its common shares 
excessive delay in the product sales cycle could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s future business prospects depend in part on the company s ability to maintain and improve its current product and to develop new products and product features 
the company believes that its future business prospects depend in large part on its ability to maintain and improve its current product and to develop new products and product features on a timely basis 
the company s product will have to achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness  and meet an expanding range of client requirements 
as a result of the complexities inherent in the company s product  major new products and product features require long development and testing periods 
the company may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or product features that respond to technological change involving industry standards or client requirements 
significant delays in the general availability of new releases of the company s product or significant problems in the installation or implementation of new releases of its product could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company may not be able to modify its product in a timely and cost effective manner to respond to technological change 
future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s product obsolete or noncompetitive 
the market for the company s product is characterized by rapid technological change  significant development costs  frequent new product introductions  changes in the requirements of the company s clients and their customers  and evolving industry standards 
the company s product is designed to work in conjunction with and on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by its clients 
however  the company s software may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments  and other systems that its clients use 
also  the company must constantly modify and improve its product to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to database systems and other applications 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions  or modifications  which may cause confusion in the market and harm the company s business 
if the company fails to promptly modify or improve its products in response to evolving industry standards or client demands  its product could rapidly become obsolete  which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
competition could reduce the company s market share and decrease its revenue 
the market for the company s product is highly competitive and the company expects competition to increase significantly in the future 
in addition  because the company s industry is new and evolving and characterized by rapid technological change  it is difficult for the company to predict whether  when  and by whom new competing technologies or new competitors may be introduced into its markets 
currently  the company s competition comes from platform providers  interaction management solution providers  and stand alone point solution providers 
the company makes no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  increased competition or other competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  or loss of market share  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
demand for communications and interaction management software for multimedia contact centers may grow more slowly than the company currently anticipates 
the majority of the company s revenue has been generated from licenses of its product and related support and professional services  and it expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
the market for the company s product and services is still emerging 
if the demand for communications and interaction management software does not continue to grow as anticipated within the company s targeted markets  the company s ability to expand its business as planned could be materially and adversely affected 
if the company fails to establish and maintain strategic relationships  the company s ability to increase its revenue and profitability will suffer 
the company currently has strategic relationships with resellers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  system integrators  and enterprise application providers 
apropos depends on these relationships to distribute its products  generate sales leads  build brand and market awareness  and implement and support its solution 
the company believes that its success depends  in part  on its ability to develop and maintain strategic relationships with resellers  oems  system integrators  and enterprise application providers 
in addition  the company intends to train and certify more strategic partners to provide the professional services required to implement its solution in an effort to expand its client base 
the company generally does not have long term or exclusive agreements with these strategic partners 
if any of the company s strategic relationships are discontinued  sales of its products and services and its ability to maintain or increase its client base may be substantially diminished 
if the company s strategic partners fail to market apropos product and services effectively or provide poor customer service  the company s reputation will suffer and it could lose clients 
if the company s strategic partners fail to market apropos product and services effectively  the company could lose market share 
some of the company s strategic partners also provide professional services to apropos clients in connection with the implementation of its product 
additionally  if a strategic partner provides poor customer service  the value of the company s brand could be diminished 
therefore  the company must maintain relationships with strategic partners throughout the world that are capable of providing high quality sales and service efforts 
if the company loses a strategic partner in a key market  or if a current or future strategic partner fails to adequately provide customer service  the company s reputation will suffer and sales of its product and services could be substantially diminished 
the company may have difficulties successfully managing its growth  which may reduce its chances of achieving and maintaining profitability 
the company s revenues increased to million in from million in the company intends to continue to expand its business operations significantly in the future 
the company has also increased its number of employees to at december   from at december  the company s existing management  operational  financial  and human resources  and management information systems and controls may be inadequate to support future growth 
if the company is not able to manage its growth successfully  it will not grow as planned and the company s business could be adversely affected 
infringement of the company s proprietary rights could affect its competitive position  harm its reputation or increase its operating costs 
the company considers its products to be proprietary 
in an effort to protect its proprietary rights  the company relies primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as licensing and other agreements with consultants  suppliers  strategic partners  resellers  and its clients  and employee and third party non disclosure agreements 
these laws and agreements provide only limited protection of apropos proprietary rights 
in addition  the company has not signed agreements containing these types of protective provisions in every case  and the contractual provisions that are in place and the protection they provide vary and may not provide the company with adequate protection in all circumstances 
although the company has patented or filed patent applications for some of the inventions embodied in its software  the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights may not be adequate 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s technology without authorization and without its detection and without infringing its patents 
a third party could also develop similar technology independently 
in addition  the laws of some countries in which the company sells its product do not protect its software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
unauthorized copying  use  or reverse engineering of the company s product could materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
infringement claims could adversely affect the company 
a third party could claim that the company s technology infringes its proprietary rights 
as the number of software products in the company s target market increases and the functionality of these products overlap  the company believes that software developers may face infringement claims 
although the company does not believe that its product infringes any patents  if certain software and technology patents were interpreted broadly  claims of infringement against the company  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
infringement claims  even if without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend 
a third party asserting infringement claims against the company or its clients with respect to the company s current or future products may require the company to enter into costly royalty arrangements or litigation  or otherwise materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in june and august  the company received letters from rockwell electronic commerce corporation claiming that apropos product utilizes technologies pioneered and patented by rockwell 
in january  rockwell filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois asserting that the company had infringed four of its patents identified in rockwell s previous correspondence 
the complaint seeks a permanent injunction and unspecified damages 
based upon the continuing review of its patent counsel of the claims being asserted by rockwell  the company believes that it likely has meritorious defenses to such claims and it intends to vigorously defend its position 
if a negotiated resolution of this matter is required  it could involve payment of license fees which would increase the company s costs 
the company makes no assurance that the terms of any licensing arrangement would be favorable to the company 
a resolution could also require a redesign of the company s product or the removal of some of the company s product features 
if a negotiated resolution is not achieved  apropos will vigorously defend this action 
if the company does not prevail  damages could be awarded and an injunction could be issued requiring apropos to cease certain activities 
if infringement is deemed to be willful  a court may triple the awarded damages 
any of these activities could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regardless of the outcome  litigation may result in substantial expense and significant diversion of the company s management and technical personnel 
the company may not be able to hire and retain the personnel it needs to sustain its business 
the company depends on the continued services of its executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of services of any of the company s executive officers or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company needs to attract and retain highly skilled technical and managerial personnel for whom there is intense competition 
the company has had some difficulty hiring highly skilled technical people due to the high market demand for their services 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel  its results of operations could suffer and the company may never achieve profitability 
the company s financial success depends to a large degree on the ability of its direct sales force to increase sales 
therefore  the company s ability to increase revenue in the future depends considerably upon its success in recruiting  training  and retaining additional direct sales personnel and the success of its direct sales force 
also  it may take a new salesperson a number of months before he or she becomes a productive member of the company s direct sales force 
the company s business will be harmed if it fails to hire and retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespersons fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than the company anticipates 
the company s international operations and expansion involve financial and operational risks 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations and enter additional international markets 
the expansion of the company s international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources to establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  and recruit additional international resellers 
revenue from international expansion may be inadequate to cover the expenses of international expansion 
the company s expansion into new international markets may take longer than anticipated and could directly impact how quickly the company increases product sales into these markets 
international markets may take additional time and resources to penetrate successfully 
the company s product needs to be conformed to the language and infrastructure requirements of other countries 
in addition  the acceptance of new technologies  such as e mail and web based forms of communication  may not occur as rapidly as in north america 
this could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
other risks the company may encounter in conducting international business activities generally could include the following economic and political instability  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory and requirements and laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  timing  cost  and potential difficulty of adapting apropos product to the local language standards in those foreign countries that do not use the english alphabet  longer sales cycles and accounts receivable cash receipts cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  fluctuations in foreign currencies  and restrictions on the repatriation of funds 
the company s product and the third party software it sells with its product could have defects for which the company is potentially liable and that could result in loss of revenue  increased costs  loss of the company s credibility  or delay in acceptance of the company s product in the marketplace 
the company s product  including applications supplied by others  may contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the portions of the company s product used to manage e mail and web based interactions are relatively new 
despite internal product testing  the company has in the past discovered software errors in some of the versions of its product after their introduction to the marketplace 
errors in new products or versions could be found after commencement of commercial shipments  and this could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and other resources from the company s other development efforts  or the loss of credibility with current or future clients 
this could result in a loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance of the company s product  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  the company has warranted to some of its clients  resellers  and oems that its software is free of viruses 
if a virus infects a client s computer software  the client could assert claims against the company that could be costly and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s license agreements with its clients typically contain provisions designed to limit its exposure to potential product liability and some contract claims 
the company s license agreements also typically limit its client s entire remedy to either a refund of the price paid or modification of the company s product to satisfy the warranty 
however  not all of these agreements contain these types of provisions  and  where present  these provisions vary as to their terms and may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions 
the company also does not have executed license agreements with all of its clients 
a product liability  warranty  or other claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
performance interruptions at the company s client s system  most of which currently do not have back up systems  could negatively affect demand for apropos products or give rise to claims against the company 
the third party software the company sells with its product may also contain errors or defects 
typically  the company s license agreements transfer any warranty from the original manufacturer of third party software to its clients to the extent permitted  but in some cases the company provides warranties regarding third party software 
product liability  warranty  or other claims brought against the company with respect to such warranties could have a material adverse affect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company depends on microsoft corporation technologies and other third party software on which its product relies 
the company s software currently runs only on microsoft windows nt servers 
a decline in market acceptance for microsoft technologies or the increased acceptance of other server technologies could cause the company to incur significant development costs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market its current product 
although the company believes that microsoft technologies will continue to be widely used by businesses  the company cannot assure prospective and existing investors that businesses will adopt these technologies as anticipated or will not in the future migrate to other computing technologies that the company does not currently support 
in addition  the company s products and technologies must continue to be compatible with new developments in microsoft technologies 
the company sells third party software with its product 
if one or more of these third parties ceases to sell their software  the company will need to modify its product to use an alternative supplier or eliminate the affected product function  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company may not be able to obtain adequate financing to implement its growth strategy 
successful implementation of the company s growth strategy will likely require continued access to capital 
if it does not generate sufficient cash from operations  the company s growth could be limited unless the company is able to obtain capital through additional debt or equity financings 
the company makes no assurance that debt or equity financings will be available as required to fund growth and other needs 
even if financing is available  it may not be on terms that are favorable to the company or sufficient for its needs 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient financing  it may be unable to fully implement its growth strategy 
if the company s clients do not perceive its product or services to be effective or of high quality  its brand and name recognition would suffer 
the company believes that establishing and maintaining brand and name recognition is critical for attracting and expanding its targeted client base 
the company also believes that the importance of reputation and name recognition will increase as competition in its market increases 
promotion and enhancement of the company s name will depend on the effectiveness of its marketing and advertising efforts and on its success in continuing to provide high quality products and services  neither of which can be assured 
if the company s clients do not perceive its product or services to be effective or of high quality  the company s brand and name recognition would suffer which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
the growth of the company s business may be impeded without increased use of the internet 
the use of the internet as a commercial marketplace is at an early stage of development 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services available over the internet is still uncertain 
in addition  governmental regulation of the internet  such as imposing sales and other taxes  access charges  pricing controls  and inhibiting cross border commerce  may reduce the use of the internet by businesses for their electronic commerce and customer service needs 
to date  governmental regulations have not materially restricted commercial use of the internet 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and may change 
new regulations could reduce the use of the internet by the company s clients and their customers 
the lack of acceptance of the internet as a forum for conducting business could reduce growth in demand for the company s product and limit the growth of its revenue 
natural microsystems  inc may become unwilling or unable to continue to supply the company with voice processing boards  requiring it to find a substitute supplier that could prove difficult or costly 
natural microsystems  inc is currently the company s sole supplier of the voice processing boards that are necessary for the operation of its product 
if natural microsystems becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these voice processing boards in the volume  at the price and with the technical specifications the company requires  then the company would have to adapt its product to perform with the voice processing boards of a substitute supplier 
introducing a new supplier of voice processing boards could result in unforeseen additional product development or customization costs and could also introduce hardware and software compatibility problems 
these problems could affect product shipments  be costly to correct  or damage the company s reputation in the markets in which it operates  and could have a material adverse affect on its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
other risks the company s share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could drop unexpectedly 
the price for the company s common shares has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors quarterly variations in the company s operating results due to prolonged sales cycles and deviations between actual and expected sales  announcements of technical innovations  new products  or new services by the company or its competitors  changes in investor perception of the company or the market for its product  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and changes in general economic and market conditions 
the shares of many technology companies have experienced significant fluctuations in trading price and volume 
often these fluctuations have been unrelated to operating performance 
declines in the market price of the company s common shares could also materially and adversely affect employee morale and retention  the company s access to capital  and other aspects of its business 
if the company s share price continues to be volatile  it may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could divert its resources 
in the past  following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities  security holders have instituted class action litigation 
many companies in the company s industry have been subject to this type of litigation 
if the company becomes involved in this type of litigation  regardless of the outcome  it could incur substantial legal costs and management s attention could be diverted  causing the company s business to suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the change in the amount of interest income the company can earn on its investments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company had short term investments of million at december  the company s short term investments consist primarily of readily available debt securities 
the company considers all investments with original maturities of less than one year from the respective balance sheet date to be short term investments 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by from levels at december   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount 
since the company is not required to sell these investments before maturity  the company has the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
on the other hand  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce interest income 
foreign currency risk the company develops products in the united states and sells these products in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  and australia 
as a result  its financial results could be affected by various factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as sales are generally made in us dollars or british pound sterling  a strengthening of the dollar or pound could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
given the level of income the company currently derives from its foreign operations  the company considers this exposure to be minimal 
the company believes a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on its future earnings
