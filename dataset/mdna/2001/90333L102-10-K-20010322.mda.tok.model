item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief  expectation or intention  as well as those that are not historical fact  are forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the heading cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements following items and of part i of this report and under the heading factors that may affect our future operating results below 
overview we derive substantially all our revenues from the sale of ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and related construction materials to the construction industry in the united states 
we serve substantially all segments of the construction industry  and our customers include contractors for commercial  industrial  residential and public works and infrastructure construction 
we typically sell ready mixed concrete under daily purchase orders that require us to formulate  prepare and deliver ready mixed concrete to the job sites of our customers 
we recognize our sales from these orders when we deliver the ordered products 
our cost of goods sold consists principally of the costs we incur in obtaining the cement  aggregates and admixtures we combine to produce ready mixed concrete and other concrete products in various formulations 
we obtain all these materials from third parties and generally have only one day s supply at each of our concrete plants 
our cost of goods sold also includes labor costs and the operating  maintenance and rental expenses we incur in operating our concrete plants and mixer trucks and other vehicles 
our selling expenses include the salary and incentive compensation we pay our sales force  the salaries and incentive compensation of our sales managers and travel  entertainment and other promotional expenses 
our general and administrative expenses include the salaries and benefits we pay to our executive officers  the senior managers of our local and regional operations  plant managers and administrative staff 
these expenses also include office rent and utilities  communications expenses and professional fees 
we purchased six operating businesses in and operating businesses in  all of which we have accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
our financial statements present central concrete supply co  inc  one of our initial six acquisitions  as the acquirer of the other businesses and us concrete 
these financial statements are those of central prior to june  and of us concrete and its consolidated subsidiaries after that date 
factors that may affect our future operating results reflecting the levels of construction activity  the demand for ready mixed concrete is highly seasonal 
we believe that this demand may be as much as three times greater in a prime summer month than in a slow winter month and that the six month period of may through october is the peak demand period 
consequently  we expect that our sales generally will be materially lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
because we incur fixed costs  such as wages  rent  depreciation and other selling  general and administrative expenses  throughout the year  we expect our gross profit margins will be disproportionately lower than our sales in these quarters 
even during traditional peak periods  sustained periods of inclement weather and other extreme weather conditions can slow or delay construction and thus slow or delay our sales 
you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our revenues and operating results as indicators of our future performance or the results of any quarterly period during a year as an indicator of results you may expect for that entire year 
demand for ready mixed concrete and other concrete products depends on the level of activity in the construction industry 
that industry is cyclical in nature  and the general condition of the economy and a variety of other factors beyond our control affect its level of activity 
these factors include  among others 
the availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction  
commercial and residential vacancy levels  
changes in interest rates  
the availability of short and long term financing  
inflation  
consumer spending habits  and 
employment levels 
we may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications 
the construction industry can exhibit substantial variations in activity across the country as a result of these factors impacting regional and local economies differently 
markets for ready mixed concrete generally are local 
our results of operations are susceptible to swings in the level of construction activity which may occur in our markets 
ready mixed concrete is highly price sensitive 
our prices are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and market conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
because of the fixed cost nature of our business  our overall profitability is sensitive to minor variations in sales volumes and small shifts in the balance between supply and demand 
competitive conditions in our industry also may affect our future operating results 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities we assume  over the fair value of the assets of the business we acquire 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we amortize goodwill over periods up to years following the acquisition  which directly affects our earnings in those years 
should we be required to accelerate the amortization of goodwill or write it off completely because of impairments or changes in generally accepted accounting principles  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
as we acquire additional businesses in the future for which we will account in accordance with the purchase method of accounting  we will include the operating results of those businesses in our consolidated operating results from their respective acquisition dates and begin writing off any purchased goodwill resulting from those acquisitions on those same dates 
consequently  the magnitude and timing of our future acquisitions will affect our operating results 
results of operations the following table sets forth for us selected historical statement of operations information and that information as a percentage of sales for the years indicated 
these financial statements are those of central prior to june  and of us concrete and its consolidated subsidiaries after that date 
except as we note below  our acquisitions in primarily account for the changes in from similarly  except as we note below  the consolidation of operating results beginning on june  and our subsequent acquisitions in principally account for the changes in from year ended december dollars in thousands sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    stock compensation charge  depreciation and amortization   income from operations    interest expense  net   other income  net  income before income tax provision    income tax provision   net income    compared to sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins increased from in to in  primarily due to improved pricing terms we have negotiated with key materials suppliers in our major ready mixed markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is attributable to additions to the corporate overhead infrastructure to accommodate our growth strategy  as well as management additions in certain of our markets 
stock compensation charge 
the stock compensation charge represents a noncash charge for the  shares of common stock we issued in december and march to management and nonemployee directors at a nominal cost 
the amount of this charge reflected a fair value of per share  which represented a discount from the initial offering price to the public of per share in our ipo 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase includes amortization of the goodwill attributable to our acquisition activity 
we are amortizing this goodwill over years for each acquisition 
at december   the annualized amount of this noncash expense was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased million from million in to million in this increase was attributable principally to borrowings we made to pay the cash portion of the purchase prices for our acquisitions 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million  at a weighted average interest cost of per annum 
other income  net 
other income  net increased  or  from  in to million in this increase is attributable to the sale of a customer contract  a gain from the involuntary conversion of property and numerous other items of income and expense 
income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  an increase of million from our provision in the increase is principally attributable to an overall increase in taxable earnings for resulting from our operating activities 
additionally  in the first five months of  central operated as an s corporation and thus made no provision for income taxes during that period 
the increase in our overall income tax provision is partially offset by a decrease in our effective income tax rate from in to in the higher rate in primarily resulted from the income tax expense we recognized as a result of the conversion of central from an s corporation to a c corporation and a nondeductible stock compensation charge which we recognized during that year 
compared to sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross margins increased from in to in  primarily because increases in our product prices more than offset increases in labor rates  additional technical personnel and increases in our costs of raw materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the expenses include the salaries of our executive officers and expenses we incurred in building our corporate infrastructure 
stock compensation charge 
the stock compensation charge represents a noncash charge for the  shares of our common stock we issued in december and march to management and nonemployee directors at a nominal cost 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase reflects our initial amortization of the goodwill attributable to our acquisition activity 
we are amortizing this goodwill over years for each acquisition 
at december   the annualized amount of this noncash expense was million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  increased million from million in to million in this increase was attributable principally to borrowings we made to finance our post ipo acquisitions in and to refinance indebtedness of our acquired businesses 
at december   we had borrowings totaling million outstanding under our credit facility at a weighted average interest cost of per annum 
income tax provision 
we provided for income taxes of million in  an increase of million from our provision in this increase is attributable to the fact that central was an s corporation during and the first five months of and thus made no provision for federal income taxes during those periods 
liquidity and capital resources our acquisitions since december  principally account for the changes in our working capital accounts and our property  plant and equipment account from december  to december  during  we purchased six businesses that we have accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
the aggregate consideration we paid in these transactions consisted of million in cash and million shares of common stock 
in february  we increased the size of our secured revolving credit facility from million to million 
we had million of outstanding borrowings under the facility at december  the facility has a term expiring in may and a million sublimit for letters of credit issued on our behalf 
our borrowing availability under the facility will vary from time to time depending on our satisfaction of several financial tests 
we may use the facility for the following purposes 
financing acquisitions  
funding the internal expansion of our operations  
working capital  and 
general corporate purposes 
our subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of all amounts owing under the facility  and we secured the facility with the capital stock and assets of our subsidiaries 
the facility 
requires the consent of the lenders for certain acquisitions  
prohibits the payment of cash dividends on our common stock  
limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and 
requires us to comply with financial covenants 
the failure to comply with these covenants and restrictions would constitute an event of default under the facility 
on november   we issued and sold to institutional investors in a private placement million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due november  for million in cash 
the terms of these notes will require us to repay them in equal annual installments of approximately million on november in each of the years through we used the net proceeds from our sale of the notes to repay borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility 
we intend to keep that facility in place and may borrow under that facility to fund future growth opportunities and for general corporate purposes 
our borrowing availability under that facility will vary from time to time depending on our satisfaction of several financial tests 
we anticipate that our consolidated cash flow from our operations will exceed our normal working capital needs  debt service requirements and the amount of our planned capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for at least the next months 
we may use funds during the next months to resolve the product warranty claim we describe under the heading product warranties in items and business and properties 
we anticipate the cash flows from our operations will provide sufficient funds for any such resolution 
the continuation of our growth strategy will require substantial capital 
we currently intend to finance future acquisitions through issuances of our common stock or debt securities  including convertible debt securities  and borrowings under our credit facility 
using debt to complete acquisitions could substantially limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the extent to which we will be able or willing to use our common stock to make acquisitions will depend on its market value from time to time and the willingness of potential sellers to accept it as full or partial payment 
using our common stock for this purpose may result in dilution to our then existing stockholders 
to the extent we are unable to use our common stock to make future acquisitions  our ability to grow will be limited by the extent to which we are able to raise capital for this purpose  as well as to expand existing operations  through debt or additional equity financings 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our presently anticipated expansion  which could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock 
we cannot accurately predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts or our associated potential capital commitments 
inflation as a result of the relatively low levels of inflation during the past three years  inflation did not significantly affect our results of operations in any of those years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to certain market risks 
outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were million at december  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  or per share  on an annual basis 
we did not enter into our credit facility for trading purposes 
the credit facility carries interest at a pre agreed percentage point spread from either the prime interest rate  or a one  two  three or six month eurodollar interest rate
