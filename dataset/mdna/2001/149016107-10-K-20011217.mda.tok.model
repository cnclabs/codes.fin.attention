item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of the dct system software and sales of hardware  and from services  which include customer support under software support contracts as well as installation and training 
prices for the dct system vary widely depending upon overall system configuration  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a dct system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
customers have the option to purchase a third party workstation from the company or provide a workstation to the company for configuration 
product sales are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installed  provided collection is probable 
the company offers product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase an annual software support contract  which includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the support contract 
these software releases may include updates for protocols already licensed by the customer 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers typically purchase onsite training  which is charged on a fixed price basis and recognized as the service is performed 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product sales increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to increased shipments of the company s dct product at higher average unit prices 
services revenue increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal service revenues grow more slowly than product revenues due to attrition in the maintenance base as older systems are replaced 
cost of revenues cost of product sales increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product sales decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of services decreased by approximately from  in fiscal to  in fiscal gross margin on services increased from in fiscal to in fiscal as services revenues grew more than the associated costs 
gross margin on services varies depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from a increase in the number of personnel engaged in research and development 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from to over the same period as expenses increased with the increase in revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from a increase in the number of personnel engaged in sales and marketing 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to increases in staffing levels  compensation expenses including executive bonuses and relocation costs  occupancy costs  recruitment costs and legal and accounting fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to over the same period 
interest income interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in funds invested and to higher prevailing rates of return early in the fiscal year 
other income expense other income decreased from an income of  in fiscal to an expense of  in fiscal due primarily to foreign exchange losses  including losses realized on forward contracts entered into which were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and to a loss on a sale of a marketable security 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease reflects primarily the impact of the creation of an irish subsidiary for international distribution of the company s products 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal over the same period  product sales decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in product sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in system sales to ntt docomo of japan  to which a particularly large sale was made in the second quarter of fiscal  but to which significantly reduced sales were made in the first quarter of fiscal in the last three quarters of fiscal  average system sale revenue from ntt docomo recovered to a level higher than that of the first quarter 
for the year as a whole  the decrease in system sales to this customer was partially offset by an increase in system sales to other domestic and international customers 
services revenue increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in service revenue was primarily due to sales of software support contracts associated with new system sales as well as increased success in selling support to the company s japanese installed customer base 
cost of revenues cost of product sales decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin proprietary hardware products  such as mpi cards  in fiscal cost of services increased by approximately from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to the cost of engineering personnel additions 
gross margin on services increased from in fiscal to in fiscal as services revenues grew more than the associated costs 
gross margin on services varies depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to increased spending on salary and project costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from to over the same period as expenses increased while revenues decreased 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increases were due primarily to higher compensation and occupancy costs resulting from the hiring of additional sales and applications engineering sales support staff in the uk  europe  canada and the us  opening a sales office in north carolina and hiring additional marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to increases in staffing levels  bonuses and executive compensation cost  as well as to incurring a full year of public company costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from to over the same period 
interest income interest income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in funds invested and to higher prevailing rates of return 
other income expense other income increased from an expense of  in fiscal to income of  in fiscal due primarily to exchange gains as opposed to losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease reflects primarily the reduction in corporate tax rates in japan over this period 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed its operations  including increases in accounts receivable and capital equipment acquisitions  primarily through cash generated from operations 
on february   the company consummated an initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price to the public of per share  of which  shares were issued and sold by the company and  shares were sold by certain stockholders of the company 
the proceeds to the company from the offering  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  principally from net income in those periods 
investing activities  consisting primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and additions to property and equipment  used cash of million and million and in fiscal and  respectively  and provided cash of million in fiscal financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal  primarily from the proceeds of the company s initial public offering   in fiscal from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan and million in fiscal from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
as of september   the company had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of september   the company had no bank indebtedness and no long term commitments other than operating lease obligations 
the company expects that capital expenditures will total approximately  in fiscal the company believes that cash and cash equivalents and short term investments together with funds generated from operations will provide the company with sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months 
the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or that if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to the company or its stockholders 
factors that may affect future results the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report on form k are important factors that may affect future results and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements that may be made by the company from time to time fluctuations in quarterly operating results  lengthy sales cycle the company has experienced  and anticipates that it will continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
the company s revenues and operating results are relatively difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including i the variable size and timing of individual purchases by customers  ii seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  such as the varying fiscal year ends of customers and the reduction in business during the summer months  particularly in europe  iii the relatively long sales cycles for the company s products  iv the timing of hiring sales and technical personnel  v changes in timing and amount of sales incentive compensation  vi competitive conditions in the company s markets  vii exchange rate fluctuations  viii changes in the mix of products sold  ix the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company  its customers  competitors or suppliers  x costs associated with developing and introducing new products  xi product life cycles  xii changes in the level of operating expenses relative to revenues  xiii software defects and other product quality problems  xiv customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  xv delays in purchasing decisions or customer orders due to customer consolidation  xvi supply interruptions  xvii changes in the regulatory environment and xviii changes in global or regional economic conditions or in the telecommunications industry 
the company s revenues in any period generally have been  and are likely to continue to be  derived from relatively small numbers of sales and service transactions with relatively high average revenues per order 
therefore  the loss of any orders or delays in closing such transactions could have a more significant impact on the company s quarterly revenues and results of operations than on those of companies with relatively high volumes of sales or low revenues per order 
see dependence on limited number of customers below 
the company s products generally are shipped within to days after orders are received and revenues are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installed  provided collection is probable 
as a result  the company generally does not have a significant backlog of orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked  shipped and installed in that quarter 
the company s expectations for future revenues are predicated  to a large extent  on the recruitment and hiring of a significant number of employees  particularly experienced sales and technical personnel 
failure to hire  or delays in hiring  sufficient sales and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for any period 
due to the relatively fixed nature of most of the company s costs  including personnel and facilities costs  and because operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a decline in revenue from even a limited number of transactions  failure to achieve expected revenue in any fiscal quarter or unanticipated variations in the timing of recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and may in some future quarter result in losses or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes  therefore  that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for all of the foregoing factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such event  or in the event that adverse conditions prevail or are perceived to prevail generally or with respect to the company s business  the price of the company s common stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
dependence on limited number of customers the company s customer base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for substantially all of the company s revenues to date 
in the fiscal year ended september   the company s top four customers represented approximately of total revenues 
the company expects that it will continue to depend upon a relatively limited number of customers for substantially all of its revenues in future periods  although no customer is presently obligated either to purchase a specific amount of products or to provide the company with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
the loss of a major customer or the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of the company s significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
stock market fluctuations in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including the company s common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of the company s common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in the company s operating results  changes in revenue growth rates for the company as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future 
competitive market for technical and sales personnel the company s success depends in part on its ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel with appropriate levels of managerial and technical capabilities 
the company believes that a significant level of expertise is required to develop and market the company s products and services effectively 
the company has in the past experienced  and expects to continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified technical and sales personnel 
the company believes that the pool of potential applicants with the requisite expertise is very limited 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
the company competes for such personnel with a number of other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than the company 
such competition has also resulted in demands for increased compensation from qualified applicants  and the company may not be able to compete effectively for such personnel with companies that provide more attractive compensation arrangements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the technical and sales personnel it requires to conduct and expand its operations successfully on a timely basis 
the failure to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel in the future would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk associated with international operations international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer customer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  changes in regulatory requirements or in economic or trade policy  costs related to localizing products for foreign countries  potentially weaker protection for intellectual property in certain foreign countries  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and practices  tariffs and other trade barriers and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
during the last three fiscal years  a significant portion of the company s sales has been to customers in japan 
if economic conditions in japan deteriorate to a significant extent  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in foreign markets on a timely basis could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of the company s international sales  including its sales in japan  are denominated in local currencies 
although the company currently engages in hedging transactions with respect to certain receivables resulting from certain inter company sales  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to do so or that its hedging activities will be successful 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
for example  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the revenues  net income  earnings per share and cash flow of the company s operations in affected markets 
similarly  such fluctuations may cause the company to raise prices  which could affect demand for the company s products and services 
in addition  if exchange or price controls or other restrictions are imposed in countries in which the company does business  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
management of growth the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on its management  administrative and operational resources 
to manage expansion effectively  the company needs to continue to develop and improve its operational and financial systems  sales and marketing capabilities and expand  train  retain  manage and motivate its employee base 
some of the company s senior management have not previously managed a business of the company s size  and these individuals have limited experience managing a public company 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that the company s management will be able to successfully exploit future market opportunities or successfully manage the company s relationships with customers and other third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow or  if it does  that the company will effectively manage such growth 
any failure to manage growth would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on customer outsourcing of test systems the company s success will depend on continued growth in the market for telecommunications test systems and services and the continued commercial acceptance of the company s products as a solution to address the testing requirements of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
while most of the company s existing and potential customers have the technical capability and financial resources to produce their own test systems and perform test services internally  to date  many have chosen to outsource a substantial proportion of their test system and service requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will continue  or that new customers will choose  to outsource any of their test systems and service requirements or that the company s products and services will be widely adopted 
if the market for telecommunications test systems and services  or the demand for outsourcing  declines or fails to grow  or if the company s products and services are not widely adopted as a telecommunications test solution  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
competitive market the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than the company 
while the company believes that the price performance characteristics of its products are competitive  price competition in the markets for the company s products is intense 
any material reduction in the price of the company s products without corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect gross margins  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased competition for the company s products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact the company s upgrade sales 
the company s ability to maintain its competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  its success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
dependence on rapidly evolving telecommunications industry the company s future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry 
the global telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly  and it is difficult to predict its potential growth rate or future trends in technology development 
there can be no assurance that the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services will continue in a manner favorable to the company or its business strategies 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced telecommunications equipment will continue at its current rate or at all 
the company s future success is dependent upon the increased utilization of its test solutions by network operators and telecommunications equipment manufacturers 
industry wide network equipment and infrastructure development driving the demand for the company s products and services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors  including cost  regulatory obstacles or the lack of or reduction in consumer demand for advanced telecommunications products and services 
there can be no assurance that telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators will develop new technology or enhance current technology or  if developed  that such new technology or enhancements will create demand for the company s products or services 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing services of its executive officers and other key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements or non competition agreements with any of its employees 
competition for qualified management and other high level telecommunications industry personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of services of any key employees would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company maintains  and is the beneficiary of  a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million with respect to dr 
richard a 
karp  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
rapid technological change  uncertainty of acceptance of the company s products and services the market for telecommunications test systems and services is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  rapid changes in customer requirements and frequent product and service introductions and enhancements 
the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to these changes by enhancing its existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
in addition  because of the rapid technological change characteristic of the telecommunications industry  the company may be required to support legacy systems used by its customers  which may place additional demands on the company s personnel and other resources and may require the company to maintain an inventory of otherwise obsolete components 
the company s test systems currently operate only on the unix operating system 
the company s current and prospective customers may require other operating systems  such as windows or windows xp  to be used in their telecommunications test systems or may require the integration of other industry standards 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully adapt its products to such operating systems on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
the failure of the company to respond to rapidly changing technologies and to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success will depend in part on whether a large number of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators purchase the company s products and services 
because the telecommunications market is rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict the future success of products and services in this market 
the customers in this market use products from a number of competing suppliers for various testing purposes  and there has not been broad adoption of the products of one company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future products or services will achieve widespread acceptance among telecommunications equipment manufacturers  network operators or other potential customers or that solutions developed by competitors will not render the company s products obsolete or uncompetitive 
in the event the telecommunications industry does not broadly adopt the company s products or services or does so less rapidly than expected by the company  or in the event the company s products are rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by more advanced solutions  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on sole and single source suppliers the company purchases many key components  including certain microprocessors  workstations  bus interface and other chips  connectors and other hardware  from the sole supplier of a particular component 
for other components  even though multiple vendors may exist  the company may purchase components from only a single source 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with these vendors to ensure uninterrupted supply of these components 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in the supply of a key component  a significant amount of time could be required to qualify alternative suppliers and receive an adequate flow of replacement components 
reconfiguration of the company s products to adapt to new components may also be required and could entail substantial time and expense 
in addition  the process of manufacturing certain of these components is extremely complex  and the company s reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes the company to potential production difficulties and quality variations  which could negatively affect cost and timely delivery of the company s products 
the company has from time to time in the past experienced supply problems as a result of the financial or operational difficulties of its suppliers  shortages and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence 
although the company  to date  has not experienced material delays in product deliveries to its customers resulting from such supply problems  there can be no assurance that supply problems will not recur or  if such problems do recur  that satisfactory solutions would be found 
any prolonged inability to obtain adequate amounts of fully functional components or any other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s relationship with its customers as well as on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on third party manufacturers the company relies on a limited number of independent manufacturers  some of which are small  privately held companies  to provide certain assembly services to the company s specifications 
the company does not have any long term supply agreements with any third party manufacturer 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in assembly services to the company  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected until the company was able to establish sufficient assembly services supply from alternative sources 
there can be no assurance that alternative manufacturing sources will be able to meet the company s future requirements or that existing or alternative sources will continue to be available to the company at favorable prices 
risk of product defects products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in future releases of the company s software or that any such errors will not generate adverse publicity  impair the market acceptance of these products  create customer concerns or adversely affect operating results due to product returns  the costs of generating corrective releases or otherwise 
product liability the company s license agreements with its customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in the company s license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions  particularly since the company sells a majority of its products internationally 
although the company has not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of products by the company may entail the risk of such claims  and there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not maintain product liability insurance 
there can be no assurance that the failure to maintain product liability insurance  in the event of the successful assertion against the company of one or a series of large uninsured claims  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
product concentration to date  substantially all of the company s revenues have been attributable to sales of the dct family of products and related services 
the company currently expects the dct family of products and related services to account for substantially all of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for dct products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future financial performance will depend  in significant part  on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the dct family of products 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in developing and marketing the dct family of products and related services

karp 
as a result  dr 
karp has the ability to effectively control matters requiring approval by the stockholders of the company  including the election of directors 
such a concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
limited protection of proprietary rights  enforcement of rights the company s success and its ability to compete effectively are dependent in part upon its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions  to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
to date  the company has not sought patent protection for its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that patent protection will not become a more significant factor in the company s industry in the future 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the measures the company undertakes will be adequate to protect its proprietary technology 
to date  the company has not federally registered any of its trademarks or copyrights 
the company s practice is to affix copyright notices on software  hardware and product literature in order to assert copyright protection for these works 
there can be no assurance that the lack of federal registration of the company s trademarks and copyrights would not have a material adverse effect on the company s intellectual property rights in the future 
additionally  the company may be subject to further risks as it enters into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are unavailable  do not provide adequate protection or are difficult to enforce 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such technology or that they will preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to the company s products 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks of third party claims of infringement the telecommunications industry is characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
while to date  the company has not been subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property by third parties  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company  that any such assertion of infringement will not result in litigation or that the company would prevail in such litigation 
furthermore  any such claims  with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to the company and diversion of its personnel  require the company to develop new technology or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
because the company does not rely on patents to protect its technology  the company will not be able to offer a license for patented technology in connection with any settlement of patent infringement lawsuits 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against the company and failure or inability of the company to develop non infringing technology or license the infringed  misappropriated or similar technology at a reasonable cost  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the company indemnifies its customers against claimed infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights of third parties 
any requirement for the company to indemnify a customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to potential acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  companies  products or technologies that it believes are complementary  although no such acquisitions or investments are currently pending 
any such future transactions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in making acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
such risks include  among others  the difficulties associated with assimilating the personnel and operations of acquired companies  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  the distraction of management and other resources  the integration of personnel and technology of an acquired company  difficulties in evaluating the technology of a potential target  inability to motivate and retain new personnel  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of the integration of new management personnel 
the company has no experience in assimilating acquired companies or product lines into its operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any such acquisitions 
furthermore  future acquisitions by the company could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation or on the market price of the company s common stock 
product development risks the company s future success will depend in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry standards and customer requirements by enhancing its existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of its customer base 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
anti takeover effect of nevada law and charter and bylaw provisions  availability of preferred stock for issuance nevada law and the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments the company s foreign subsidiaries operate and sell the company s products in various global markets 
as a result  the company is exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency denominated sales made to foreign subsidiaries 
the company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables 
the company attempts to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables being hedged in terms of currency  amount and maturity 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the exposures hedged  these financial instruments do not subject the company to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
realized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts offset foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated inter company receivable balances which otherwise would be charged to other income expense 
to date  the company has not fully hedged all risk associated with its sales denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that the company s hedging activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   the company had forward exchange contracts and options maturing in fiscal to sell approximately million in japanese yen designed to hedge against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the fair market value of these contracts and options at september  was not material 
the company has evaluated the potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term currency fluctuations and believes that any such losses would not be material 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio 
as of september   short term investments consisted of available for sale securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note balance sheet components in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these fixed income marketable securities included corporate bonds and government securities  all of which are of high investment grade 
they are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if the market interest rates increase 
if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position
