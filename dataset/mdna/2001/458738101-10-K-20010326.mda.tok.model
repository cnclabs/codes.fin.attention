item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview interleukin genetics  inc  a delaware corporation is a functional genomics company focused on personalized medicine 
we believe that by identifying individuals at risk for certain diseases and combining it with specific therapeutic interventions  better healthcare decisions can be made  reducing costs and greatly improving patient health outcomes 
we have a growing portfolio of patents covering the genetics of many common diseases and conditions  including cardiovascular diseases  osteoporosis  complications of diabetes  restenosis and periodontal disease 
we believe that one of the great challenges confronting medicine today is to find the key to understanding why some people are more prone than others to developing serious chronic diseases and why some people respond to medicine for those diseases better than others 
until doctors are able to understand the underlying causes for such variability in chronic diseases  the practice of medicine will remain largely constrained to our current approach of prescribing therapies based on broad  sweeping recommendations in which very large groups of people with the same stage of disease all receive the same treatment 
this approach to medicine is  in many ways  quite impersonal and it is often ineffective 
until now  scientific study of chronic diseases has largely focused on identifying factors that initiate or cause a disease 
common examples of such factors include cholesterol in the case of heart disease  bacteria of the mouth in the case of periodontal disease and reduced estrogen levels in the case of osteoporosis 
however  the mere presence of these initiating factors does not mean a person will develop a disease 
for example  everyone with a cholesterol level considered high does not develop heart disease nor does everyone with a normal cholesterol level avoid heart disease 
rather  the common diseases as we know them only develop when our bodies respond to the initiating factors in a way that results in a problem 
we believe that the recent expansion in understanding of human genetic information coming from programs like the human genome project will likely change the impersonal way medicine is practiced forever 
this is because the response of an individual s body to the common disease initiating factors is largely determined by their specific genes 
by using the new tools of the genomic era  scientists will be able to study how differences in a specific individual s genetic information directs their body to respond to these disease initiating factors in different ways 
this is likely to be true both for identifying who is most likely to develop one disease or another and who is most likely to respond to one or another medicine 
since it is our genes that make us unique  at least in the biologic sense  tailoring medical therapy based on knowledge of our genetic tendencies will enable doctors to move beyond the one size fits all approach to prescribing medicines and enable them to practice medicine which is more personalized to each of us based upon our unique genetic make up 
our first genetic test  pst r  a test predictive of risk for periodontal disease  is currently marketed in the united states  europe and israel 
other products under development include tests predictive of risk for osteoporosis  coronary artery disease  complications of diabetes and restenosis 
we have also developed and licensed medical research tools  including biofusion r  to pharmaceutical and biotech companies 
biofusion is a computer modeling system that integrates genetic and other sub cellular behavior  biological functions  and clinical symptoms to simulate complex diseases 
this system allows useful information to be derived from rapidly increasing databases of gene expression being generated in companies and academic centers worldwide 
in august  we entered into an agreement with kenna technologies  inc kenna whereby we granted kenna a perpetual  non exclusive license to certain disease information system technology and to certain biological modeling technology  including the biofusion system mentioned above 
in consideration for these license rights  kenna paid us a non refundable initial licensing fee of  and has agreed to pay royalties based upon net sales from certain of the licensed technology  as defined  for periods ranging from five to ten years 
we are recognizing the initial licensing fee of  ratably over the term of the agreement 
we have followed a strategy of working with strategic partners at the fundamental discovery stage 
this strategy has given us access to discoveries while reducing up front research expenses 
since  we have had a strategic alliance with the department of molecular and genetic medicine at sheffield university sheffield in the united kingdom 
under this alliance  sheffield has provided us with the fundamental discovery and genetic analysis from their research laboratories  and we have focused on product development  including clinical trials  and the commercialization of these discoveries 
we have issued  shares of common stock to sheffield and its investigators  which was valued at  and was expensed in the third quarter of in addition  we are required to issue sheffield and its investigators  options to purchase common stock each june th during the period of time the arrangement is in place  and  additional options to purchase common stock each june th for each patent which is approved during the previous twelve months 
in december  we entered into a license agreement with hain diagnostika ads gmbh hain for the marketing  distribution and processing of pst in all countries outside of north america and japan 
hain has extensive experience in commercializing genetic tests on its dna strip technology platform in several fields as well as a specific commitment to marketing products directly to dentists 
hain s central facility offers excellent turnaround times  high quality laboratory operations and a sales and technical staff to support clinical users 
in march  we entered into an exclusive agreement with the straumann company  a leading supplier of dental implants  to market and sell pst in the united states and puerto rico 
straumann launched its pst promotional activities in april in september  we amended the straumann agreement to be non exclusive and entered into an agreement with kimball genetics  inc  who has expertise in the processing and analysis of genetic tests and their results 
under the terms of this agreement  kimball has a co marketing right with straumann and will process and analyze all pst tests in the united states and puerto rico 
we believe that through our various partners we have adequate coverage in the sales  distribution and processing of pst 
in the majority of these agreements we receive a royalty for each test sold 
revenue for pst sales has been   and  for the years ended december   and respectively 
during  we changed our strategy for marketing and distributing pst 
we no longer market  distribute or process the pst tests ourselves 
we now use third party marketers and distributors from whom we earn royalties 
we believe that while this will reduce revenues in the short term it will also improve margins and reduce operating costs 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or 
in june we received an up front payment of  from dumex alpharma a s for the rights to distribute our genetic susceptibility test for periodontal disease pst r in nine european countries 
we recognized  of this payment as revenue during and no revenue from this source during the decrease in revenue is also the result of an october change of our method of distributing pst 
since october  we license the marketing rights for pst and collect only royalties 
this has reduced our per test revenue and cost of revenues per test 
cost of revenues was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in  representing a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in revenue discussed above 
gross margin decreased to in from in primarily as a result of the fee from dumex alpharma a s recognized in mentioned above 
for the year ended december   we had research and development expenses of  as compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily due to  of non cash expense in associated with issuance of  shares of common stock to the university of sheffield and its investigators in conjunction with the new arrangement entered into in october we expect clinical trial related expenses to increase during and future periods 
for the year ended december   we had selling  general and administrative expenses of  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily the result of costs of approximately  associated with our relocation to waltham  massachusetts 
interest income increased to  in from  in  an increase of  or 
this increase is attributable to the increase in cash and investments resulting from the completion of private placements in january and december the reduction in our debt obligations is the primary reason for the decrease in interest expense from  in to  in  a decrease of  or 
net loss applicable to common stock was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is due primarily to a  charge in for the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock issued in our june private placement 
upon shareholder approval of the private placement in august all of the preferred stock converted to common stock 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to higher average selling price for pst 
cost of revenues was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in  representing a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to lower laboratory costs for processing pst tests 
gross margin improved to from due to the higher average selling price of pst and the lower processing costs 
for the year ended december   we had research and development expenses of  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to  of non cash expense associated with issuance of  shares of common stock to the university of sheffield and its investigators in conjunction with the new arrangement entered into in october selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for to  from  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease reflects the reduction in personnel  infrastructure and related costs as we shifted from an internal sales staff to the use of outside distributors to sell its pst tests 
interest income decreased to  in from  in this decrease is attributable to lower levels of cash and investments due to losses from operations and a  reduction in our debt obligation 
the reduction in the debt obligation is also the primary reason for the interest expense decreasing from  in to  in  a decrease of  or net loss applicable to common stock increased to  in from  an increase of  or due to a  charge for the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities generated interest income of  for the year ended december  in january  we sold in a private placement million shares of common stock for per share and we issued to the purchasers warrants to purchase  shares of common stock exercisable at per share 
approximately million of net proceeds was received from issuance of common stock and warrants 
net cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december  as compared to  used during cash was used to fund operating losses and was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and by non cash charges from the issuance of stock and stock options for services rendered 
investing activities used cash of  in and  in during the years ended december  and  we used cash to purchase marketable securities as we shifted excess cash from cash and cash equivalents into marketable securities to earn a preferred interest rate 
financing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  during  we received  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants  net of expenses 
during  we received  in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and  in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we made capital lease payments of  in and  in we currently do not have any commitments for material capital expenditures 
our obligations at december  for capital lease obligations totaled  of which  is classified as long term and  is classified as current 
these capital lease obligations have mature through august at various interest rates 
we have entered into research agreements with brigham and women s hospital and genome therapeutics corp 
under which we have future cash commitments of  and  respectively  at december  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated interest income and revenue  will be sufficient to conduct operations as planned until july however  our future capital requirements are anticipated to be substantial  and we do not have commitments for additional capital at this time 
such capital requirements are expected to arise from the commercial launch of additional genetic tests  continued research and development efforts  the protection of our intellectual property rights including preparing and filing of patent applications  as well as operational  administrative  legal and accounting expenses 
we plan to raise capital through equity and or debt issuance when  and if  such capital is available to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional capital 
if additional amounts cannot be raised and we are unable to substantially reduce our expenses  we would suffer material adverse consequences to our business  financial condition and results of operations and would likely be required to seek other alternatives up to and including protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of securities of u 
s treasury notes 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are short term and subject to minimal interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of these securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of december   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements as a whole
