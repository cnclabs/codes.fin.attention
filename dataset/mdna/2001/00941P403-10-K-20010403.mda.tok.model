item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview we provide base stations and other wireless telecommunications infrastructure products designed to support the gsm  or global system for mobile communications  system of mobile voice and data transmission 
we market our products worldwide to operators of wireless networks 
a base station is a key component of a wireless network and is used to receive and transmit voice and data signals over radio frequencies 
our products include the adaptacell base station  a software defined base station  meaning it uses software to control the way it encodes and decodes voice and data wireless signals  and the airsite backhaul free base station  which carries voice and data signals back to the wireline network without using a physical communications link 
these products are continually evolving 
we began marketing our gsm base stations in the beginning of and shipped our first gsm base station in may through december   we shipped and billed for base stations 
our base stations are being used in thirteen commercially deployed systems 
we currently sell and market our products in the us through our direct sales force 
internationally  we sell our products through our direct sales force  as well as through agents and oems 
from our inception in january through may  our operations consisted principally of start up activity associated with the design  development  and marketing of our products 
we did not generate significant revenues until and have generated only million in net revenues from our inception through december  we have incurred substantial losses since commencing operations  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
because we will need to continue to focus heavily on developing our technology and products  building our sales and distribution systems and assembling the personnel necessary to support our anticipated growth in the near future  we expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next several quarters 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to support expected increases in research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  and to achieve and maintain profitability 
our revenues are derived from sales of a product line based on the gsm system 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  with three customers accounting for of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended december  through year end  all of our sales were to domestic customers 
for the fiscal year ending december   of our revenues were from international deployments 
we expect our percentage of international revenues to increase substantially as a result of our expansion of international sales and distribution activities 
we have and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues as a result of our long and variable sales cycle 
historically  our sales cycle  which is the period from the time a sales lead is generated until the recognition of revenue  has ranged from to months 
the length and variability of our sales cycle is influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including our customers buildout and deployment schedules  our customers access to product purchase financing  our customers degree of familiarity with our products  the need for functional demonstrations and field trials  the manufacturing lead time for our products  delays in final acceptance of products following shipments  regulatory developments  and our revenue recognition policies 
the effect of our long sales cycle on our results is compounded by our current dependency on a small number of customers 
revenue from product sales to customers through our direct sales force and through agents is recognized after delivery and resolution of any uncertainties regarding satisfaction of all significant terms and conditions of the customer contract 
given our limited operating history  such uncertainties have historically been considered resolved when the customer has either placed the products in service or completed specified testing procedures 
during late  our history regarding resolution of such uncertainties was sufficient to recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the contract fee was considered fixed and determinable 
as a result of this determination   was recognized as revenue during the fourth quarter 
all contracts under extended payment terms which are repayable more than twelve months after delivery are not considered fixed and determinable and revenue is deferred and recognized as the fee becomes due 
in general  our gross margins will be affected by the following factors demand for our products and services  new product introductions  both by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  the mix of base stations and other products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  the mix of domestic and international sales  and the volume pricing we are able to attain from contract manufacturers and third party vendors 
we currently obtain all of our primary components and subassemblies for our products from a limited number of independent contract manufacturers and purchase circuit boards  electronic and mechanical parts and other component assemblies from a limited number of oems and other selected vendors 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenues is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  final assembly  testing and product integration 
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the design  development and support of our proprietary technology 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our technology and future products 
in particular  we may incur significant costs in connection with our efforts to develop the software needed to upgrade our base stations to support emerging wireless high speed data transmission standards 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  consulting fees  tradeshow expenses  advertising  marketing expenses and allocated overhead 
we intend to increase expenditures for selling and marketing as a result of expansion of distribution channels  strategic relationships  sales and marketing personnel  and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses for finance  office operations  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting and other professional fees and bad debts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues is a result of higher shipments to  and installations by  new and existing customers as they expand their commercial networks 
additionally  we completed development and began shipping international versions of our product during  which accounted for of the net revenue or million 
gross profits gross profit decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the decrease in the gross profit margin was mainly attributable to increased inventory related charges  including write downs for certain product obsolescence  of million and low sales volume in the fourth quarter of research and development research and development expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to recruitment and additional new hires and contract labor as well as the purchase of additional engineering lab equipment and supplies 
these increased expenses were the result of an effort to accelerate product development and was driven by an increased demand by our larger customers for advanced features and a rapid increase in the adoption of wireless internet services by subscribers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  expenses increased for the recruitment and acquisition of additional new hires to expand our international sales and distribution activities and sales support functions 
travel  trade show and public relations expenses and the opening of our new customer training center also contributed to the increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase to the provision for bad debts 
additionally  expenses in recruitment  accounting and legal services contributed to the increase 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from strong demand for our propriety adaptacell broadband  software defined base stations and our airsite backhaul free base stations by new wireless operators and repeat business from our existing customers  as they expanded their service areas 
gross profits gross profit increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the increase in the gross profit margin was attributable to the increased volume of shipments during the year 
research and development research and development expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to recruitment and additional new hires and the purchase of additional engineering lab equipment and supplies 
these increased expenses were the result of an effort to accelerate product development and was driven by an increased demand by our larger customers for advanced features and a rapid increase in the adoption of wireless internet services by subscribers 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  expenses increased for the recruitment and acquisition of additional new hires to expand our international sales and distribution activities and sales support functions 
travel  trade show and public relations expenses also contributed to the increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million provision for bad debts in the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by increased salaries  employee benefits expenses  and travel expenses 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering in december  which raised net proceeds of million  we funded our operations primarily through the private sales of equity securities and through capital equipment leases 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents 
we have no credit facilities 
on april   we obtained a binding commitment from three of our current stockholders  or affiliates  to purchase to purchase  from the company in a private placement  an aggregate of million of a new authorized series b convertible preferred stock 
the issuance of the new series b preferred stock is contingent only on approval by our common stockholders  which we intend to seek by a stockholder vote to be undertaken in april in the interim  the investors have agreed to deposit the aggregate investment of million in escrow trust  to be released to us upon approval of the issuance of the preferred stock 
two investors funded million to the trust on april  the remaining million will be funded no later that april  we expect this investment to be completed by may  when combining the cash balance of million at december  with the million investment  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations through however  if negative cash flows from operations in exceed current estimates  our liquidity could become strained in the latter part of net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  million in and million in the significant use of cash by operating activities was the result of the net losses during all reported periods together with cash used to finance our increase in accounts and notes receivable and inventory purchases 
except for sales to oems or to customers under agreements providing for acceptance concurrent with shipment  our customers are billed as contractual milestones are met 
deposits of approximately of the contracted amount typically are received at the inception of the contract and an additional of the contracted amount is generally billed upon shipment 
most of the remaining unbilled amounts are invoiced after a customer has placed the products in service  completed specified acceptance testing procedures or has otherwise accepted the product 
collection of the entire amounts due under our contracts to date have lagged behind shipment of our products due to the time period between shipment and fulfillment of all of our applicable post shipment contractual obligations  the time at which we bill the remaining balance of the contracted amount 
this lag requires increasing investments in working capital as our revenues increase 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million 
of this balance was attributable to two customers  and receivables from one of these customers accounted for approximately of the total amount outstanding 
in some instances  we have offered vendor financing to certain customers where it assists us in entering a strategic market or where it is an initial part of a larger order 
as of december   our total notes receivable balance was million  of which approximately was owed by one customer 
part of this amount was a conversion of accounts receivable to a secured note where extended terms were provided to the customer 
we used net cash for capital expenditures of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and  december   respectively 
these expenditures reflect our investments in computer equipment  software development tools and test equipment  and other capital equipment which was required to support our business expansion 
we lease our primary manufacturing and office facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
we also have operating leases for certain other furniture  equipment and computers 
we used net cash for operating leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
future minimum payments for operating leases including payments under our new lease for final assembly and testing facilities in melbourne  florida aggregated through the year were approximately million as of december  we also lease certain computer and test equipment under capital lease arrangements 
we used net cash for capital leases of approximately million  million and 
million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
future minimum payments for capital leases aggregated through the year were approximately million as of december  we believe that our available cash resources combined with the net proceeds of the private placement will be sufficient to fund operating losses and meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the end of the fourth quarter of the company s historical sales and its current backlog do not give the company sufficient visibility or predictability to indicate that the required sales levels might be achieved 
the company currently believes that sales will increase from fourth quarter of levels in the first and second quarters of  and increase at higher growth rates in the third and fourth quarters of if such third and fourth quarter sales do not materialize  the company will have to reduce its expenses to maintain cash levels necessary to sustain its operations 
thereafter  we will need to raise additional funds 
we may need to raise additional funds sooner to fund more rapid expansion  continue development of new or enhanced products  respond to competitive pressures  fund unexpected expenditures or operating losses or acquire businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
this amount includes payments under our new lease for final assembly and testing facilities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible subordinated notes or other debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed  on favorable terms or at all 
forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties this report contains forward looking statements  including statements under the captions management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business and elsewhere in this report  concerning our expectations of future sales  gross profits  earnings  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  product introductions and cash requirements 
forward looking statements often include words or phrases such as will likely result  expect  will continue  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  project  outlook or similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance 
they are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results may vary materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
we are not obligated to update these statements or publicly release the results of any revisions to them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
certain risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations are set forth below 
we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely affected by one or more of these factors 
risk factors we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
we anticipate continuing losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have accumulated losses of million since we began doing business in through december   and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
since we began doing business in  we have generated only million in net revenues through december  we have been marketing our gsm base stations since  and to date the majority of our sales have been to a small number of start up domestic wireless operators 
we have never reported a profit 
we will continue to incur significant research and product development  sales and marketing  materials and general administrative expenses  and we expect our expenses to increase as compared to prior periods  as we expand our sales force and our international operations 
we anticipate a net loss for the year and we may continue to incur losses beyond we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues or margins to sustain our business 
we have a limited operating history 
you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future results 
our base stations are being used in thirteen commercially deployed systems 
we had net sales of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unless we can achieve significant increases in market acceptance of our products  we may never advance beyond our market penetration phase 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible for us to predict future results and you should not expect future revenue growth based on our recent results 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and problems faced by technology companies in the early stages of development 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a sale will be made and could cause us operating difficulties and cash flow problems 
our sales cycle  which is the period from the generation of a sales lead until the recognition of revenue  can be long and is unpredictable  making it difficult to forecast revenues and operating results 
our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of our sales could cause a number of problems we may have difficulty meeting our customers delivery requirements in the event many large orders are received in a short period of time because we have limited production capacity and generally do not carry materials in inventory  we may expend significant management efforts and incur substantial sales and marketing expenses in a particular period that do not translate into orders during that period or at all  and we may have difficulty meeting our cash flow requirements and obtaining credit because of delays in receiving orders and because the terms of many of our customer contracts defer certain billings until post shipment contractual milestones are met 
the problems resulting from our lengthy and variable sales cycle could impede our growth  harm our stock price  and restrict our ability to take advantage of new opportunities 
intense competition in the market for wireless telecommunications equipment from many larger  more established companies with greater resources could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability 
the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is highly competitive 
we compete with large infrastructure manufacturers  systems integrators  and base station subsystem suppliers  as well as new market entrants 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger installed customer bases  substantially greater name recognition  and more financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including companies that develop and market new wireless telecommunications products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of customers 
our comparative inability to provide financing for our customers is a competitive disadvantage and could result in a loss of sales and or customers to competitors with greater resources 
we do not typically offer financing to our customers which could cause us to lose business to our larger competitors 
our future success may depend upon our continuing ability to help arrange financing for our customers 
if we cannot assist in arranging financing for our customers  we may lose sales and customers to competitors that directly provide financing 
credit risk problems resulting from customer financing could hurt our results and require us to raise additional capital 
many of our customers and potential customers are start up and small companies with a limited operating history 
in some instances  we have provided and will continue to provide customer financing 
we face credit risks  including slow payments or non payments from customers  and we may need to raise additional capital to support financed sales and to deal with related credit risk problems 
our lawsuit against lucent technologies relating to a purported cancellation of a purchase order by a large customer could be expensive  could divert management s time and resources  and may not be successful 
on october   we filed a complaint against lucent technologies  inc et 
al 
in the circuit court for the th judicial circuit in brevard county  florida  alleging  among other claims  tortious interference with a business relationship and misappropriation of trade secrets in connection with the purported cancellation of certain phase ii purchase orders by carolina pcs 
we are seeking more than million in damages and injunctive relief 
lucent has filed a number of pre trial motions  which we are vigorously opposing 
the cost of pursuing this litigation could be high and could divert the attention of our management s time and resources 
this type of interference with our customers could result in the loss of orders from other customers in the future 
a small number of customers account for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers could hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our customer base has been and may continue to be concentrated with a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers or the delay  reduction or cancellation of orders by or shipments to any of these customers could hurt our results and cause a decline in our stock price 
the effect of these risks on our operating results is compounded by our lengthy sales cycle 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our net revenues  with sales to one customer accounting for 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our net revenues  with sales to one customer accounting for 
for each of these periods  one of the three largest customers included carolina pcs  which is the customer whose purchase orders are the subject of our lawsuit against lucent technologies 
we have a concentrated customer base and the failure of any of our customers to pay us or to pay us on time could cause significant cash flow problems  hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our concentrated customer base significantly increases the credit risks associated with slow payments or non payments by our customers 
these risks are also higher for us since many of our customers are start up and small companies 
three customers accounted for of our combined outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december   with one customer  carolina pcs  representing 
two customers represented of our outstanding accounts receivable as of december   with one customer  carolina pcs  representing 
in the past and for the year ending december   we have incurred bad debt charges and we may be required to do so in the future 
the failure of any of our customers to pay us  or to pay us on time  could cause significant cash flow problems  hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
as we continue to expand into international markets  we will become subject to additional business risks 
we have begun marketing and selling our products internationally in africa  the middle east  asia and latin america 
our business plan contemplates that a majority of our sales over the next several years will be in international markets 
a portion of our international sales efforts will be targeted to service operators who plan to deploy wireless communications networks in developing countries where risks ordinarily associated with international operations are particularly acute including developing countries in africa  asia  the middle east and latin america 
international operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including difficulties and costs associated with obtaining foreign regulatory approval for our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  legal uncertainties regarding  and timing delays and expenses associated with  tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts  lack of suitable export financing  adverse tax consequences  dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations  overcoming cultural  linguistic and nationalistic barriers and adapting to foreign business practices  political and economic instability  and currency fluctuations  including a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could make our products less competitive against those of foreign competitors 
any of these factors could impair our ability to expand into international markets and could prevent us from increasing our revenues and achieving profitability 
if we do not succeed in the development of new products and product features in response to changing technology and standards  customers will not buy our products 
we need to develop new products and product features in response to the evolving demands for better technology or our customers will not buy our products 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging wireless transmission standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
if we fail to develop our technology  we will lose significant potential market share to our competitors 
we may not be able to modify our base stations to support all of the developing wireless standards and that could seriously harm our business 
our base stations do not yet support all emerging high speed data standards 
we will incur research and development costs to develop upgrade packages to make our base stations compatible with them 
we cannot predict with certainty that we will be able to meet the technical demands of all of these new standards nor can we predict with certainty that our base stations will have substantially increased capacity  and if we are not successful  our business could be seriously harmed 
even if we do develop our technology and products to work with these new standards  consumer demand for advanced wireless services may not be sufficient to justify network operators upgrading to them 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary rights which would hurt our ability to compete 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other measures  intellectual property is difficult to evaluate and these measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary rights and information 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our proprietary rights and information  disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise  and our proprietary rights and information may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have not been granted any foreign patents and presently have only a relatively low number of patent applications pending internationally 
if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenues 
others may bring infringement claims against us that could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in the future  claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
even if none of these claims were valid or successful  we would be forced to incur significant costs and divert important resources to defend against them 
any claim of infringement  whether or not successful  could cause us considerable expense and place a significant burden on our management 
a significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines will diminish one of our competitive advantages 
existing base stations require an expensive physical communications link  usually through a digital t e phone line  to the wireline network 
any significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines used to connect base stations to the wireline network  especially in less populated areas  will diminish a cost advantage that we currently use to market our products 
the cost of t e facilities has recently declined significantly in urban areas because of increased competition 
if we fail to expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators we may not be able to significantly grow our revenues 
we will only be able to significantly grow our revenues if we can expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators 
there are a limited number of such operators and most of them have limited resources 
these operators are less stable and more susceptible to delays in their buildouts and deployments than more established operators 
we plan on expanding our sales to include the larger domestic operators and international operators 
however  as a result of the rapid consolidation of larger domestic gsm operators  there are only a few larger domestic operators remaining 
to date we have not had any sales to the larger domestic operators  and we may not be successful in those markets in the future 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could lead to delays  additional costs  problems with our customers and potential customers  and loss of revenue 
we plan to continue utilizing only one or a small number of suppliers for each of the components of our base station systems 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our suppliers that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment or credit terms 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quality and quantity requirements or stops selling products to us at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product image problems 
any of these problems could damage relationships with current or prospective customers which could seriously harm our operating results in a given period and impair our ability to generate future sales 
from time to time  we must replace some of the components of our products when the supplier of that component is discontinuing production 
while we generally do not maintain an inventory of components  sometimes we do purchase an inventory of these discontinued components so that we can maintain production while finding new suppliers or developing substitute components ourselves 
we face the risk that we may deplete that inventory before finding an adequate substitute  and that could cause the loss of significant sales opportunities 
alternatively  we could purchase too many of the components and may be left with excess inventory on our hands 
we generally do not maintain an inventory of finished goods and many components have long lead times  with some taking to weeks from the time of entry of the order to delivery 
we cannot guarantee that alternative sources of supply can be arranged on short notice or that components will be available from alternative sources on satisfactory terms 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  we may not be successful 
our future success largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  particularly call processing engineers and digital signal processing engineers 
the market for these engineers is highly competitive and if we cannot continue to attract and retain quality personnel  that failure would significantly limit our ability to compete and to grow our business 
our success also depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  research  product development  sales and marketing and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace  including r 
lee hamilton  jr  president and chief executive officer 
except for a severance and noncompetition agreement we have with dr 
hamilton  we do not have employment or noncompetition agreements with any of our key officers 
we also do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
if we fail to manage our growth and expansion effectively  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
the need to develop and offer our products and implement our business plan in an evolving market will significantly challenge our planning and management capabilities 
the total number of employees at december  was we plan to continue to hire new employees as we expand our operations 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
to manage our expected growth of operations and personnel  we will need to improve financial and operational controls  as well as our reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and hire  train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical  finance and customer support employees 
we have an agreement with motorola  inc 
to grant them rights which could harm our business 
when motorola purchased million of our series b preferred stock in  we granted motorola the right to acquire a worldwide  nonexclusive  royalty free license under any two of our patents 
motorola is a large telecommunications and technology company with significant resources and could exercise this right at any time and begin using these licenses to compete against us 
with respect to any possible infringement of our respective digital base station patents  each of us also agreed not to enjoin the other and to attempt dispute resolution  including negotiation of nonexclusive license agreements in good faith  before resorting to litigation 
we expect the prices of our products to decline due to competitive pressures  and this decline could reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we anticipate that the prices of our products will decrease in the future due to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing our sales volumes  our revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do these things successfully 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could seriously harm our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may make future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders percentage ownership  cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 
we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  enhance our technical capabilities  help secure critical sources of supply or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur additional debt  or assume liabilities 
these purchases also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations on reasonable terms and this could hurt our business and negatively impact our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available on reasonable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could seriously harm our business 
if our capital requirements vary from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced  the securities issued may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations 
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation that could cause significant delays and expense 
wireless telecommunications are subject to extensive regulation by the us and foreign governments 
if we fail to conform our products to regulatory requirements or experience any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  we could lose sales 
moreover  in most cases  we only plan to qualify our products in a foreign country once we have a purchase order from a customer located there  and this practice may deter customers or contribute to delays in receiving or filling orders 
continuing regulatory compliance could be expensive and may require time consuming and costly modifications of our products 
any failure of domestic and international regulatory authorities to allocate suitable frequency spectrum could limit our growth opportunities and our future revenues 
because our products are highly complex and are deployed in complex networks  they may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment  which if not remedied could harm our business 
our products are highly complex  are designed to be deployed in complex networks and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures 
although our products are tested during manufacturing and prior to deployment  they can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
consequently  our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects  errors or failures could result in installation delays  product returns  diversion of our resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  increased insurance costs and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
we invested the net proceeds from our initial public offering in december and the proceeds from other financing activities in interest bearing  investment grade securities which mature within months 
our transactions are generally conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  these funds were not exposed to significant foreign currency risk at december
