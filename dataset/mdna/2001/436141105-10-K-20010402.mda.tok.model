as a result  the company recorded a charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the charge  margins decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily the result of increased rental inventory amortization in the fourth quarter of using the new amortization estimates 
rental gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue increased to in from in in the fourth quarter of  the company significantly changed its business model 
in order to increase the quantity and selection of newly released video titles and satisfy the customer s demand while trying to mitigate the company s risk  we entered into revenue sharing agreements with major studios 
prior to these revenue sharing agreements  the company paid approximately to per videocassette for major theatrical releases that were priced for rental in the united states 
the company was seldom able to fully satisfy its customer s demand for new releases under this fixed price model 
the company expected that the revenue sharing model would have a significant impact on the company s cost of rental as it changed its business model from a primarily fixed to a primarily variable cost approach 
starting in the fourth quarter of  revenue sharing payments became a significant component of the company s cost of rental 
the revenue sharing agreements made it necessary for the company to make adjustments to its inventory valuation as of october  in order to account for the shorter rental lives that videocassettes have in the revenue sharing business model because initial customer demand is satisfied significantly sooner 
as a result of this change  the company recorded a million charge to reflect a reduction in the carrying value of rental inventory in the fourth quarter of see note

the increase in reel

the company operated  superstores at december  compared with  superstores at the end of operating and selling expense decreased as a percentage of total revenue in primarily due to higher average revenue per store in compared to restructuring for closure of internet business on june   the company announced that it would close down the e commerce business at reel 
com 
the company developed a leading web site over the seven quarters since reel 
com was purchased in october of  but its business model of rapid customer acquisition led to large operating losses and required significant cash funding 
due to market conditions  the company was unable to obtain outside financing for reel 
com  and could not justify continued funding from its video store cash flow 
on june   the company terminated employment of approximately of reel 
com s employees  and paid million in involuntary termination benefits 
the remaining employees have since been terminated or integrated into hollywood entertainment 
the company plans to maintain the web site as a content only site to minimize any negative effect the reel 
com shutdown may have on existing hollywood video store customers for a period of time not expected to exceed twelve months from the e commerce shutdown 
during this time  point of purchase materials promoting reel 
com as an e commerce destination will be removed from the stores 
to offset the costs of maintaining the web site during this period  the company entered into a short term agreement with buy 
com to direct reel 
com visitors to buy 
com to make purchases 
revenues associated with the buy 
com agreement and the expenses of maintaining the web site have been recognized as earned and incurred  respectively 
as a result of the discontinuation of e commerce operations  the company recorded a total charge of million in the current year second quarter  of which million was classified as a restructuring charge on the consolidated statement of operations and million was included in cost of product sales 
in the fourth quarter of the current year  the charge was reduced by million to million because the company was able to negotiate termination of certain obligations and lease commitments more favorably than originally anticipated 
the restructuring charge line item includes million of severance and benefits paid on june   million of asset write downs  and million of accrued liabilities 
the assets written down include the remaining million of goodwill associated with the acquisition of reel

liquidity and capital resources overview during  the company experienced a number of significant events with respect to its liquidity and capital situation 
the company began the year growing at the average rate of one store per day  as well as funding significant cash losses at reel 
com 
in order to meet the funding needs to continue at this growth rate  the company s then existing million credit facility needed to be expanded or refinanced 
during early  the company attempted to refinance this facility 
in march the company received an underwritten commitment from a group of banks for a new million credit facility 
however  syndication of this new facility failed in may primarily due to lenders concerns with losses at reel 
com and the significant capital needed to fund our aggressive growth 
without the availability of new funding  the company was faced with the need to begin reducing the outstanding principal amount of its million credit facility starting with million on december  and continuing to reduce by million each quarter thereafter 
in order to meet this obligation  the company needed to make significant changes to its growth plans 
as part of these changes  in june of  the company closed the e commerce business at reel 
com  thereby stopping its cash losses 
furthermore  the company made the decision to stop its new store growth and not sign new leases for the remainder of the year 
at that time  the company had signed leases for stores yet to open in and the company has since worked to either open the remaining stores or terminate their leases 
as of december   the company had opened of those stores and terminated leases  with an additional remaining 
in  the company intends to terminate the remaining leases and anticipates opening fewer than stores 
stopping new store growth allows more of the cash flow from the company s over  existing video stores to pay down debt or vendor balances 
in the fourth quarter of  the company turned free cash flow positive for the first time as a public company 
after being a net user of cash since inception  the company became a net generator of free cash 
cash provided by operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued revenue sharing  which are sources of operating cash 
in order to fund the company s investing activities for  including opening new stores and purchasing new releases for existing stores  and meet its debt service requirements for including million of amortization requirements under the credit facility and million of maturities of capital lease obligations  the company generated funds through increases in working capital 
we estimate that accounts payable will decrease by approximately million in as we bring down vendor balances 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease is primarily due to fewer new store openings in and no store acquisitions 
the company opened new stores in and only stores in the company anticipates that the number of new store openings in will be fewer than following is a table summarizing our cash used in investing activities for the last three years purchases of rental inventory  net    purchase of property and equipment  net    investment in businesses acquired   increase in intangibles and other assets   total cash used in investing    purchases of video rental inventory include buying the initial rental inventory for new stores  as well as a portion of the cash costs for video product for existing stores such as revenue share up front fees  and purchases of games  dvds and non revenue sharing movies 
capital expenditures other than product include equipment  fixtures  and leasehold improvements for new and existing stores  remodeling projects  and implementing and upgrading office and store technology 
we anticipate that capital expenditures  other than purchases of rental inventory  will be approximately million in  of which million is anticipated to relate to new  relocated and remodeled stores 
the remaining balance relates to corporate capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to an increase of cash provided by operations  coupled with a decrease in cash used by investing activities due to slower store growth 
in the first quarter of  the company borrowed an additional million through capital lease financing  and over the course of the year has repaid million of principal on capital leases 
the balance on the revolving credit facility began the year at million  reached a maximum of million at september  and was reduced to a balance of million at december  leaving the company million under the maximum availability of million 
because it is doubtful the company will be able to meet the scheduled facility amortization of million  the company has been negotiating a restructured amortization with its lenders 
on march   the company made a million amortization payment and its lenders agreed to defer million of the million total due on that date and work toward a permanent change in the amortization schedule to better match debt pay down with the current business plan 
this change is scheduled to be completed by may  however  this change requires the affirmative vote of of the approximately lenders involved with the credit facility 
there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in its negotiations 
as a result of this  in addition to the fact that the company has had net losses in   and and at december  has a shareholders deficit of million  the company s independent accountants have included a going concern paragraph in their report dated march   except as to note which is dated march   on our consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  if it negotiates a new amortization schedule which better matches debt pay down with the current business plan  it is possible that our independent accountants would rescind this going concern paragraph 
adjustments relating to the realization of assets and classification of the liabilities that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern have not been made 
as of december   the company was in violation of covenants contained within the credit facility 
the company was able to obtain the appropriate waiver for the violations 
however  this waiver expires may  because it is probable the company will incur covenant violations after may  without a restructured agreement  in accordance with fas  classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor  the company has reclassified million of the credit facility that matures in to current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  other financial measurements working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million 
rental inventories are accounted for as non current assets under generally accepted accounting principles because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of the company s revenue  the classification of these assets as non current excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  the company believes working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as a non current asset  the company will  more likely than not  operate with a working capital deficit 
recently issued accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the impact they may have on the financial condition or results of operation of the company 
general economic trends  quarterly results and seasonality the company anticipates that its business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
future operating results may be affected by various factors  including variations in the number and timing of new store openings  the performance of new or acquired stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  weather  special or unusual events and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
the video retail industry generally experiences relative revenue declines in april and may  due in part to the change in daylight savings time and due to improved weather  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
the company believes these seasonality trends will continue

the company may make other forward looking statements from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we now think are immaterial may also impair our business operations or could otherwise cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if that occurs  the trading price of our securities could decline 
past expansion places pressure on our operations and management controls 
we have expanded the size of our store base and the geographic scope of operations significantly over the last several years 
this expansion has placed  and we expect it to continue to place  increasing pressure on our operating and management controls 
to manage our larger store base  we will need to continue to evaluate our financial controls  management information systems and distribution facilities 
we may not adequately anticipate or respond to all of the changing demands of expansion on our infrastructure 
we depend on key personnel  recent management changes are unproven 
our future performance depends on the continued contributions of certain key management personnel 
in late and early  the company made significant changes to management personnel of the company  including adding two new outside directors to the board of directors  reinstating mark j 
wattles  the company s founder and chief executive officer  full time as president  hiring scott schultze as chief administrative officer and sam ellis as chief information officer  promoting roger osborne to executive vice president of store operations and restructuring other executive and senior management positions 
these new members of management may not be able to successfully manage our existing operations and they may not remain with us 
our future profitability also depends on our ability to attract and retain other management personnel  including qualified store managers 
we face intense competition and risks associated with technological obsolescence 
the video retail industry is highly competitive 
we compete with local  regional and national video retail stores  including those operated by blockbuster  inc  the largest video retailer in the us  and with supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  mass merchants  mail order operations  online stores and other retailers  as well as with noncommercial sources such as libraries 
according to information disclosed by video store magazine  the five largest video store chains had a market share of all us consumer rentals in the video software dealers association and the national association of video distributors estimated that at the end of there were  independent video stores in the us we believe that over of all locations that rent video titles are currently operated by independent store owners whose average store revenue tends to be significantly less than a hollywood video store 
on the other hand  some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  market share and name recognition than the company 
substantially all of our stores compete with stores operated by blockbuster  most in very close proximity 
as a result of direct competition with blockbuster  rental pricing of videos is a significant competitive factor in our business and  from time to time  in certain markets  blockbuster has cut prices below those offered in our stores 
if price cutting occurs on a more sustained and widespread basis  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we also compete with cable  satellite and pay per view television systems  in which subscribers pay a fee to see a movie selected by the subscriber 
existing pay per view services offer a limited number of channels and movies and are available only to households with a direct broadcast satellite receiver or a cable converter to unscramble incoming signals 
digital compression and other developing technologies  however  are expected eventually to permit cable companies  direct broadcast satellite companies  telephone companies and other telecommunications companies to transmit a much greater number of movies to homes at more frequently scheduled intervals throughout the day 
certain cable and other telecommunications companies have tested and are continuing to test movie on demand services in some markets 
technological advances or changes in the manner in which movies are marketed  including in particular the earlier release of movie titles to pay per view providers  such as direct broadcast satellite  cable television or other distribution channels  could make these technologies more attractive and economical  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business would be adversely affected if revenue sharing arrangements were reduced or eliminated 
we believe our operating results have been and will continue to be positively affected by revenue sharing arrangements with movie studios 
see item business revenue sharing and pricing 
if the scope of these arrangements were reduced  or if some studios were to stop using these arrangements  our business would be adversely affected 
movie studios might reduce their use of revenue sharing if they found it to be less profitable than alternative distribution methods  in response to technological developments  as the result of new government regulation  or for other reasons 
we would lose a significant competitive advantage if the movie studios were to adversely change their current distribution practices 
currently  video stores receive movie titles approximately two months earlier than pay per view  cable and satellite distribution companies 
due to the large  reliable market that home video provides for studios for both hit and non hit movies when compared to the alternative pay per view sources  it is likely that movie studios will continue to make movie titles available exclusively to video stores before they are made available to additional distribution channels 
see item business industry overview movie studio dependence on video retail industry and item business competition 
if movie studios change this distribution schedule such that video stores were no longer the first distribution channel to receive a movie title after a movie studio s theatrical release or to provide for the earlier release of movie titles to pay per view providers  such as direct broadcast satellite  cable television or other distribution channels  however  this could make these alternative technologies more attractive and economical than video rental  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future operating results may fluctuate 
various factors may affect future operating results  including variations in the number and timing of store openings  the performance of newer stores  the quality and number of new release titles available for rental and sale  the expense associated with the acquisition of new release titles  acquisitions by us of existing video stores  changes in comparable store revenue  additional and existing competition  marketing programs  labor conditions in the movie industry that affect the production of new movies  weather  special or unusual events  seasonality  the success of new business initiatives  and other factors that may affect retailers in general 
if operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future period  the trading price of our securities would likely decline  perhaps significantly 
we have substantial amounts of outstanding indebtedness 
at december   there was million outstanding under our million senior revolving credit facility  and we had outstanding million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
our indebtedness presents risks to investors  including the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal of and interest on the indebtedness 
our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness will be dependent on our future operating performance  which is dependent on a number of factors many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include prevailing economic conditions and financial  competitive  regulatory and other elements affecting our business and operations  and may be dependent on the availability of borrowings 
if we do not have sufficient available resources to repay any indebtedness when it becomes due and payable  we may find it necessary to refinance indebtedness  and such refinancing may not be available  or available on reasonable terms 
additionally  our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our future operating performance  including  but not limited to  the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to debt service payments  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage  our leverage will limit our ability to expand  and our leverage may hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or our business 
if a change of control of the company occurs  we may be required to purchase all or a portion of the notes then outstanding at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
prior to commencing such an offer to purchase  we may be required to i repay in full all of our indebtedness that would prohibit the repurchase of the notes or ii obtain any consent required to make the repurchase 
we may be unable to make timely amortization payments under our credit agreement and we may be unable to renegotiate a revised amortization schedule with our lenders 
under the terms of the senior revolving credit agreement  the company began reducing the outstanding principal amount of its million credit facility starting with a million amortization payment on december  we are required to continue making million payments each quarter 
because it is doubtful the company will be able to meet the scheduled facility amortization of million  the company has been negotiating a restructured amortization with its lenders 
on march   the company made a million amortization payment and its lenders agreed to defer million of the million total due on that date until may  in order to work toward a formal amendment to the credit agreement  which will include a revised amortization schedule to better match debt pay down with the company s current business plan 
we have presented our lenders with a business plan which provides for sufficient capital for competitive levels of product in our hollywood video stores and timely payment for vendors while also giving the lenders meaningful debt reduction over the next to months 
the company is targeting to have the amended amortization schedule approved by the lenders by may  however  this change requires the affirmative vote of of the approximately lenders involved with the credit facility and there is no assurance that we will be successful in our negotiations 
if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may be unable to meet the required quarterly payments 
because amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company  a failure to make the amortization payments could be harmful to the operations of the company and adversely affect the trading price of our securities 
we have incurred nonrecurring expenses in the recent past 
in  we had special charges for a litigation settlement of million  an inventory write down of million  million related to a failed self tender offer  and 
million from a loss on early extinguishment of debt 
in  the company accounted for an inventory write down of million 
in  we took special charges of million related to the settlement of lawsuits and a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a loss of approximately million and a negative adjusted ebitda of approximately million primarily due to the following special charges i write downs associated with modifications to rental product depreciation estimates  ii write downs of excess and obsolete inventory primarily due to the stoppage of new store growth  iii impairments of goodwill and fixed assets  iv reserves against receivables  v reserves against deferred tax assets  vi employee severance costs  vii litigation and other settlement costs  viii costs associated with terminating existing leases  and ix a restructuring charge for the planned closure of stores in if we incur special charges in the future  they could adversely affect our results and cause the trading price of our securities to decline 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in july the common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market  which market has experienced and is likely to continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to our operating performance 
we also believe factors such as fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of new technologies in movie distribution or announcements by us or competitors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
these factors  as well as general economic conditions such as recessions or high interest rates  may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law may have anti takeover effects 
our board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
in addition  provisions of oregon law could make it more difficult for a party to gain control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the company s financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company has entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term and long term debt 
historically  and as of december  the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
the interest payable on the company s credit facility is based on variable interest rates ibor or the prime bank rate at the company s option and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
hypothetically  if variable base rates were to increase in as compared to the end of  the company s interest rate expense would increase by approximately million based on the company s outstanding debt as of december
