optika s acorde family of internet software solutions  including acorde context tm  process tm and resolve tm  allow companies to effectively and cost efficiently manage paper intensive or complex business processes and transactions 
acorde provides the ability to access and store multiple formats of business content  both digital and non digital  automate processes across the organization and externally with partners and customers  and enable online collaboration around these paper intensive or complex processes in real and near time 
a three tier  scalable and extensible solution  acorde delivers a variety of client desktops  including windows  web and the ability to integrate with line of business and other third party applications 
the acorde product family allows organizations to improve processing efficiency  reduce operating costs and increase customer and trading partner service and satisfaction 
the acorde product is an evolution of optika s emedia product 
the license of our software products is typically an executive level decision by prospective end users and generally requires us and our aps to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six and twelve months from the initial contact date 
we distribute our products through a direct sales force and a network of aps 
for  approximately of our license revenues were derived from our aps and the remaining license fees were derived from direct sales 
however  no individual customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  we generated approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues from international sales 
our revenues consist primarily of license revenues  which are comprised of one time fees for the license of our products  service revenues  and maintenance revenues  which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical support 
our aps  which are responsible for the installation and integration of the software for their customers  enter into sales agreements with the end user  and license software directly from us 
we license software directly to the end user through software license agreements 
annual maintenance agreements are also entered into between the aps and the end user  and the aps then purchase maintenance services directly from us 
for and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from software licenses and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from maintenance agreements 
for and  other revenues  which are comprised of training  consulting and implementation services  and third party hardware and software products  accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during february  we strategically reduced our workforce by approximately 
this reduction in force resulted in approximately million of restructuring charges to earnings in the first quarter of  primarily to cover severance and severance related costs 
we will realize savings during fiscal year from the reduction in salary costs  office space and related overhead expenses as a result of the restructuring plan 
further  we anticipate cash outflows during fiscal year will be reduced from the related expense reductions 
we earn our revenue primarily from licenses and fees 
our revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  as amended 
we will generally recognize license revenue upon shipment when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed or a purchase order has been received  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
where applicable  fees from multiple element arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements 
maintenance revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  which is generally one year 
other revenues are recognized as services are performed 
we adopted sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amended sop on january  sop requires the residual approach for multiple element arrangements when vsoe exists for the undelivered elements such as maintenance but is not known for the delivered elements 
the adoption of sop had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we generally do not grant rights to return products  except for defects in the performance of the products relative to specifications and pursuant to standard industry shrink wrapped license agreements which provide for day rights of return if an end user does not accept the terms of the shrink wrapped license agreements 
our software license agreements generally do not provide price adjustments or rotation rights 
we generally include a day limited warranty with the software license  which entitles the end user to corrections for documented program errors 
based on our internal research and development process  costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and general release of the software products are immaterial and therefore have not been capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
all internal research and development costs have been expensed as incurred

license revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing approximately and  respectively  of total revenues in both periods 
the decrease in license revenue is attributable to a shift in focus from our core technologies to the addition of collaborative tools which caused us to lose momentum in our traditional core product markets of acorde context and acorde process 
during the end of and into we have recognized the loss of momentum and have increased our focus on our customers and aps in delivering a clearer product message that focuses on the strengths of our legacy applications complimented by our collaborative product offering

in  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near term 
our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all available evidence  both positive and negative 
in particular we considered both our historical results and our projections of profitability for only reasonably foreseeable future periods 
our realization of the recorded net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore  we cannot assure you that such benefits will be realized

general and administrative expenses decreased from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to writing off or reserving asian accounts receivable during restructuring charges and other non recurring charges 
due to the economic status and instability in the asian markets  we made the decision to shut down two of our four asian offices in the third quarter of  thus reducing future operational risks and cash outflows into the region 
this restructuring resulted in a  one time write off including  of goodwill   of severance costs and  of lease termination and other costs 
all actions relating to the restructuring plan were completed during and no restructuring accruals remain as all cash payments had been made as of december other income  net

income tax benefit 
during we recorded a partial valuation allowance against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near term 
our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all available evidence  both positive and negative

our realization of the recorded net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore  we cannot assure you that such benefits will be realized 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  at december  was million  increasing by approximately million from december  this increase is due to the proceeds from the preferred stock transaction offset by our net loss and capital expenditures associated with additional computer equipment

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which defines derivatives  requires that all derivatives be carried at fair value  and provides for hedging accounting when certain conditions are met 
sfas no 
 which has been amended by sfas  is effective for our fiscal year ending december  the adoption of sfas no 
had no significant impact on the our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
subsequently  the sec released sab b  which delayed the implementation date of sab for registrants with fiscal years beginning between december  and march  the adoption of sab had no significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this opinion provides guidance on the accounting for certain stock option transactions and subsequent amendments to stock option transactions 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  to the extent that fin covers events occurring during the period from december  and january   but before july   the effect of applying this interpretation are to be recognized on a prospective basis 
the adoption of fin had no significant impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  we had million in short term investments that are sensitive to market risks 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations 
we do not own any derivative financial instruments 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio we are primarily subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are primarily united states government and agency bonds of durations ranging from one to four years 
the market value of these bonds is subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
any material change in the interest rates would have a material change in the market value of our debt instruments 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from december  would cause the fair market value of these short term investments to change by an insignificant amount
