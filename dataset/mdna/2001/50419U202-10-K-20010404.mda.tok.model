hotel operating revenues generally are measured as a function of the adr and occupancy 
the adr increased to during year ended december  from in  an increase of or 
occupancy percentage decreased percentage points to in from for revpar decreased below revpar for the decrease in revpar is partially due to an increase in the supply of available rooms in the region and segment of the lodging industry in which la quinta competes 
certain decisions made by la quinta in related to pricing  centralization of senior field operations personnel and the relocation of its headquarters from san antonio  texas to irving  texas coupled with the continuing disruptive impact of the new property management system have contributed to the decrease in revpar 
the hotel revenue decrease was partially offset by the addition of revenues from the acquisition of telematrix in october revenue related to telematrix for the year ended december  was  compared to  in the three month post acquisition period ended december  total recurring expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  the increase in hotel operating expenses and general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increases in salary and wage rates and related benefits  expenses associated with implementation of the new property management system  increased sales expenses  increased hotel repair and maintenance expenses  expenses associated with the realignment of field operations personnel  an increase in bad debt expense  severance and employment related expenses  the relocation of its headquarters from san antonio  texas to irving  texas  an increase in franchise taxes and certain other incremental expenses

operating results of operations years ended december  and operating reported a net loss available to common paired shareholders of  or per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  revenues and expenses operating derived its revenue primarily from hotel operations after the la quinta merger on july  hotel revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  revenue growth was primarily attributable to the increase in hotel operating revenues because there were twelve months of hotel operations in compared to the five and one half month post acquisition period ended december  approximately  or of hotel revenues were derived from room rentals during the year ended december   compared to  and during the year ended december  hotel operating revenues generally are measured as a function of adr and occupancy 
the adr increased to in from in  an increase of or 
occupancy percentage decreased percentage points to in from in revpar  which is the product of occupancy percentage and adr  decreased when compared to the decrease in revpar in part due to a greater increase in the supply of available rooms than in demand in the region and segment of the lodging industry in which la quinta operates 
the relationship between supply and demand varies by region and it has impacted la quinta to a greater extent than its competitors due to its concentration of hotels in the southwest 
the revenue impact of the oversupply of available rooms was somewhat mitigated by revenue increases resulting from a higher proportion of room rental income from the inn suites hotels as compared to the inns during the comparable periods 
inn suites hotels generally have higher room rental income per night compared to the inns 
other factors contributing to the decrease in revpar include the disruptive impact of the introduction of the new property management system  the reorganization of the operations and the sales organizations during the third quarter of and certain pricing decisions  which adversely impacted revpar 
telematrix revenues for the year ended december  were  for the year ended december   total recurring expenses were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in lodging related expenses  which include an increase in operating expenses of  increases to rent  royalty and interest due to realty of  and an increase to general and administrative expenses of  the increase in operating expenses  net rent  royalty and interest due to realty as well as overhead for the lodging segment is attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of activity in compared to the five and one half month post acquisition period in and  to a lesser extent  inclusion of  of operating costs incurred related to the telematrix acquisition 
hotel operating expenses and overhead primarily includes costs associated with the operation such as salaries  wages  utilities  repair and maintenance  credit card discounts and room supplies as well as corporate expenses  such as the costs of general management  office rent  training and field supervision of hotel managers and other marketing and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of  includes an increase of  in overhead for the lodging segment and  related to telematrix

on may   the companies entered into a separation agreement with the former director and chairman of the companies and chief executive officer and treasurer of operating 
under the terms of the separation agreement  operating made severance payments totaling  in cash and the continuation of certain life insurance benefits 
the companies established a special committee to evaluate the employment contract and whether such severance or other payments were appropriate 
based on the results of the evaluation and recommendation of the special committee  the boards concluded that the separation agreement was in the long term best interest of the shareholders of the companies and approved the separation agreement 
in conjunction with the implementation of the plan  which included a change in the focus of the lodging division to internal growth  la quinta management performed a review of the front desk system under development for its lodging facilities and made a decision to abandon the project 
the decision was based primarily on management s intent to integrate the front desk system with new revenue management software  availability of more suitable and flexible externally developed software and a shift in information systems philosophy toward implementation of externally developed software and outsourcing of related support services 
a charge of approximately  to write off certain internal and external software development costs related to the project was recorded in the first quarter of operating also incurred approximately  associated with the reorganization of the lodging division including employee severance and other expenses

the meditrust companies  realty and operating combined liquidity and capital resources the companies earn revenue by i owning and operating la quinta inns and la quinta inn suites  ii leasing healthcare facilities under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators and iii providing mortgage financing for healthcare facilities in which the interest is generally fixed with annual escalators subject to certain conditions 
approximately  of the companies debt obligations are floating rate obligations in which interest rate and related cash flows vary with the movements in the london interbank offered rate libor 
the general fixed nature of the companies assets and the variable nature of a portion of the companies debt obligations creates interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  the companies interest payments may increase  resulting in decreases in net income and funds from operations 
to mitigate this risk  the companies have entered into interest rate swaps to convert some of its floating rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate swaps generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments on an underlying notional amount 
at december   the companies had  of interest rate swaps outstanding in which the companies pay a fixed rate of to the counterparty and receive libor from the counterparty 
accordingly  at december   the companies have no variable debt outstanding with interest rates that fluctuate with changes in libor 
operating does not have independent access to financing and is a guarantor on realty s debt 
as a result  the liquidity and capital resources discussion related to realty is relevant to operating 
cash flows from operating activities the principal source of cash to be used to fund the companies  realty s and operating s future operating expenses and recurring capital expenditures will be cash flow provided by operating activities and in the case of operating the deferral of rent and royalty payable to realty

cash flows from investing and financing activities the companies  realty and operating provide funding for new investments and costs associated with restructuring through a combination of long term and short term financing including both debt and equity 
the companies and realty also provide funding for new investments and costs associated with restructuring through the previously announced sale of certain healthcare related assets 
as part of the five point plan  the companies and realty have decided to sell additional healthcare related assets to meet their commitments and to provide additional liquidity

operating obtains long term financing through the issuance of shares and unsecured notes 
the companies and realty obtain short term financing through the use of bank lines of credit  which are replaced with long term financing as appropriate  while operating obtains short term financing through rent and royalty deferrals and borrowings from realty 
from time to time  the companies and realty utilize interest rate caps or swaps to attempt to hedge interest rate volatility 
it is the companies and realty s objective to match healthcare mortgage and lease terms with the terms of their borrowings 
the companies and realty attempt to maintain an appropriate spread between their borrowing costs and the rate of return on their investments

the companies further intend to use cash flow from operations and the proceeds from sales of healthcare assets under the five point plan to repay amounts due under the senior credit facility 
the companies also intend to pursue the refinancing of amounts due under realty s senior credit facility  which the companies believe may be facilitated by the continued sale of certain healthcare assets

the companies believe that their various sources of capital  including availability under realty s credit facility  operating cash flow for both realty and operating  proceeds from the sale of certain healthcare assets as contemplated under the five point plan and operating s borrowings from realty are adequate to finance their operations as well as their existing commitments  including financial commitments related to certain healthcare facilities and repayment of debt  through the second quarter of however  the companies have significant debt maturing during the third quarter of although the companies intend to continue to sell healthcare assets and to pursue the refinancing of the senior credit facility  the companies efforts and the success of these efforts  will be impacted by many factors  some of which are outside of the companies control 
the factors impacting the sale of the healthcare assets include the nature of the assets being sold including the condition  financial or otherwise  of the operators of such assets  the overall condition of the healthcare real estate market at the time of any such sale  the nature of the consideration delivered by any purchaser of such assets and the presence of other similar healthcare properties for sale on the market at the time of any such sale including the effect that the presence of such other properties could have on the prices that can be obtained in such sales and the availability of financing for prospective purchasers of such assets 
the section entitled certain factors you should consider commencing on page of this joint annual report on form k for the year ending december  contains additional factors that could impact the companies efforts and the success of those efforts  in selling healthcare assets and refinancing the senior credit facility 
the above described factors including those set forth in certain factors you should consider commencing on page of this joint annual report on form k specifically will impact the amount of the consideration to be received in connection with the sale of any such assets  which will impact the amount of debt obligations that may be repaid in connection with such sales  as well as the gain or loss that will be recognized by realty in connection with such sale 
further  to the extent realty enters into agreements to sell assets at sales prices less than the carrying value of such assets on realty s balance sheet after giving effect to prior adjustments to such carrying value  realty will recognize losses related to such sales  some of which may be substantial as a result of the above described transactions  at the time that such agreements are entered into  rather than at the time such sales are actually consummated 
accordingly  the companies cannot guarantee that their efforts to sell healthcare assets  or to pursue the refinancing of the senior credit facility  will be successful

realty monitors credit risk for its healthcare portfolio by evaluating a combination of publicly available financial information  information provided by the operators themselves and information otherwise available to realty 
the financial condition and ability of these healthcare operators to meet their rental and other obligations will  among other things  have an impact on realty s revenues  net income loss  funds available from operations  its ability to make distributions to its shareholders and meet debt obligations 
the operations of the long term care skilled nursing companies have been negatively impacted by changes in medicare reimbursement rates pps  increases in labor costs  increases in their leverage and certain other factors 
in addition  any failure by these operators to effectively conduct their operations could have a material adverse effect on their business reputation or on their ability to enlist and maintain patients in their facilities 
operators of assisted living facilities are experiencing fill up periods of a longer duration and are being impacted by concerns regarding the potential of over building  increased regulation and the use of certain accounting practices 
accordingly  many of these operators have announced decreased earnings or anticipated earnings shortfalls and have experienced a significant decline in their stock prices 
these factors have had a detrimental impact on the liquidity of some assisted living operators  which has slowed their growth plans and may have a negative effect on their operating cash flows 
operators in bankruptcy as of december   the companies have exposure to five operators who have filed for protection under chapter sun healthcare group  inc sun  mariner health group mariner  integrated health services  inc integrated  genesis health ventures  inc genesis and carematrix corporation carematrix

net lease assets operated by sun include straight line rent receivables of the companies continue to monitor its operators that have filed for chapter to date  the companies have not come to any definitive agreement with any of these operators 
in the event any of its leases are successfully rejected through the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  the companies intend to transition the operations of these facilities to other operators 
management has initiated various actions to protect the companies interests under its leases and mortgages including the draw down and renegotiations of certain escrow accounts and agreements 
while the earnings capacity of certain facilities has been reduced and the reductions may extend to future periods  management believes that it has recorded appropriate accounting impairment provisions based on its assessment of current circumstances 
however  upon changes in circumstances  including but not limited to  possible foreclosure or lease termination  there can be no assurance that the companies investments in healthcare facilities would not be written down below current carrying value based upon estimates of fair value at such time 
combined funds from operations combined funds from operations ffo of the companies was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
effective january  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit adopted a new definition of ffo 
presentation of ffo for has been restated to conform to presentation 
management considers ffo to be a key external measurement of reit performance 
ffo represents net income or loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding real estate related depreciation  amortization of goodwill  gains and losses from the sale of assets and provisions for impairment on owned properties  mortgages and real estate related equity securities  income taxes and extraordinary items 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing  or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
the following reconciliation of net income and loss available to common shareholders to ffo illustrates the difference between the two measures of operating performance for the years ended december  and certain reconciling items include amounts reclassified from discontinued operations and  accordingly  do not agree to revenue and expense captions in the companies financial statements 
year ended december  in thousands net income loss available to common shareholders   depreciation of real estate and intangible amortization   other capital gains and losses   other expenses a   discontinued operations  income tax expense extraordinary item  funds from operations   a other expenses include provisions for assets and mortgages of  and  includes  for provision for working capital receivables for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expenses also include impairment of real estate securities of  and were offset by recoveries on prior impairments of  for the year ended december  weighted average paired common shares outstanding basic   diluted   options to purchase  paired common shares weighted average effect of  shares for the year ended december  at prices ranging from to were outstanding during fiscal year and were not included in the computation of eps because their inclusion would result in an antidilutive per share amount as the companies reported a loss from continuing operations available to common shareholders for the year ended december  reit qualification issues the ticket to work and work incentives improvement act of the ticket to work act modified certain provisions of federal income tax law applicable to reits 
all of the changes described below became effective with respect to the companies after december  these changes include new rules permitting a reit to own up to of the stock of a corporation a taxable reit subsidiary  taxable as a c corporation  that may provide non customary services to the reit s tenants and may engage in certain other business activities 
however  a taxable reit subsidiary cannot directly or indirectly operate or manage a lodging or healthcare facility 
a taxable reit subsidiary may own a lodging facility ie  a hotel or lease one from the reit provided no gambling revenues are derived from the hotel or its premises  provided that the lodging facility is operated by an eligible independent contractor 
an eligible independent contractor is an independent contractor that is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating lodging facilities for persons or entities unrelated to the reit 
due to the foregoing restrictions imposed on the use of taxable reit subsidiaries in the case of lodging and healthcare facilities  the opportunity for the companies to make use of taxable reit subsidiaries is limited 
the ticket to work act also replaces the former rule permitting a reit to own more than of a corporate subsidiary by value  provided its ownership of the voting power is limited to a decontrolled subsidiary  with a new rule prohibiting a reit from owning more than of a corporation by vote or value  other than a taxable reit subsidiary described above or a qualified reit subsidiary a wholly owned corporate subsidiary that is treated as part of the reit for all federal income tax purposes 
existing decontrolled subsidiaries are grandfathered  but will lose such status if they engage in a substantial new line of business or acquire any substantial new asset after july   other than pursuant to a contract binding on such date and at all times thereafter prior to acquisition and certain other limited exceptions 
accordingly  taking into account the companies general inability to utilize taxable reit subsidiaries in the conduct of its lodging and healthcare operations  the ticket to work act severely limits the ability of realty to own substantial ownership interests in taxable corporate subsidiaries 
direct ownership by realty of assets that otherwise would be held in a decontrolled subsidiary may not be possible without disqualifying realty as a reit and transfer of such assets to operating similarly may not be possible without causing realty to recognize substantial taxable income or jeopardizing the companies current grandfather status under the anti paired share legislation enacted as part of the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act 
in combination with the restrictions on activities of a grandfathered paired share reit provided for in the reform act  the ticket to work act limits the ability of realty to grow through construction or acquisition of new hotels or the acquisition of other lodging brands or companies 
compliance with the tax rules applicable to reits generally and to paired share reits in particular  has become increasingly difficult due to additional limitations imposed by the reform act and the ticket to work act as well as other developments in the companies businesses  including its recent sales of healthcare assets and consequent loss of related qualifying rental and interest income 
due to recent sales of healthcare assets and the resulting loss of qualifying rental and interest income  disqualifying income has increased as a percentage of realty s gross income 
disqualifying income cannot exceed of realty s gross income 
although realty currently satisfies this requirement  additional asset sales which will result in further reductions of qualifying rental and interest income as well as increases in royalty income which is considered nonqualifying income could cause realty to exceed the gross income limit for non qualifying income  resulting in reit disqualification and or substantial costs to avoid such disqualification 
based on the five point plan and the companies announced intention to increase its focus on its lodging business including franchising  which will generate royalty income and sell a significant portion of its healthcare assets  the companies intend to continue to reevaluate its financial  legal and tax structure to determine the best platform for growing la quinta and enhancing shareholder value going forward 
other provisions in the ticket to work act include a reduction in the annual minimum distribution requirement for a reit from to of its taxable income excluding net capital gain and a provision which allows a reit to own and operate a healthcare facility for a least two years with extensions for up to another four years possible if the facility is acquired by the termination or expiration of a lease  with net income with respect to such property subject to corporate tax but not counted as disqualifying income for purposes of qualification as a reit 
restructuring the operations of realty and operating to comply with the ticket to work act and the reform act may cause one or both of the companies to incur substantial tax liabilities and other costs  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill asset related to the acquisition of the paired share structure or to take other actions that may otherwise adversely affect one or both of the companies 
newly issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which replaced sfas no

certain factors you should consider unless the context otherwise requires  all references to we  us  or our refer generally to the companies  their subsidiaries and respective predecessor entities for the applicable periods  although the context may  in certain situations  require that these words refer to either realty or operating individually 
presented below are certain factors that you should consider with respect to an investment in our securities 
you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below  which may materially impact your investment in our securities or may in the future and  in some cases  already do  materially affect us and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
you should carefully consider these factors 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements  you should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements discussed on page our strategic focus on lodging related properties exposes investors to risks common in that industry that may adversely affect an investment in our securities 
there are a number of operating risks that could have an adverse effect on the companies lodging related business 
we have made a significant investment in lodging related facilities through our acquisition of la quinta 
la quinta is operated by a subsidiary of operating and its real estate assets are owned by realty or a subsidiary of realty 
the results of operations of la quinta hotels are subject to many factors  including changes in the national  regional and local general economic climate  competition from comparable hotels  the desirability of particular locations  the quality  philosophy and performance of the lodging facility managers and supervisors  availability of qualified labor  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation  capability of management information systems  the need to reinvest capital to periodically repair and upgrade the lodging facilities  increases in travel expenses that reduce business and leisure travel  increases in expenses such as real estate tax and utilities  and the relationship between supply of and demand for hotel rooms an oversupply of hotel properties or a reduction in demand for hotel rooms 
la quinta operates in a very competitive market 
la quinta hotels generally operate in markets that contain numerous competitors  including a wide range of lodging facilities offering full service  limited service and all suite lodging options to the public 
the continued success of our hotels will be substantially dependent upon our ability to compete in such areas as affordable and competitive room rates  quality of accommodations  name recognition  service level and convenience of locations 
additionally  an increasing supply of hotel rooms in la quinta s market segment and recent consolidations in the lodging industry generally  have resulted in the creation of several large  multi branded hotel chains with diversified operations and may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that demographic  geographic or other changes in markets will not adversely affect the convenience or desirability of the locations of our hotels 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that competing hotels will not provide greater competition for guests than currently exists in the markets in which our hotels operate or that new hotels will not enter such markets 
our lodging related properties are geographically concentrated 
la quinta s hotels are concentrated in the western and southern regions of the united states 
as a result  our lodging properties are particularly sensitive to adverse economic and competitive conditions and trends in those regions and such conditions may specifically affect our cash available for distribution to shareholders 
the concentration of lodging properties in one region may expose us to risks of adverse economic developments  which are greater than if our portfolio were more geographically diverse 
our lodging related business and operations are subject to extensive employment and other governmental regulation 
the lodging business is subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation  including building and zoning requirements  all of which can prevent  delay  make uneconomical or significantly increase the cost of developing additional lodging facilities 
in addition  la quinta s hotels and operating are subject to laws governing their relationship with employees  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions  work permit requirements and discrimination claims 
an increase in the minimum wage rate  employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees could adversely affect our financial results 
fluctuations in operating results are common in the lodging industry 
operating results in the lodging industry may be adversely affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in local market conditions  an oversupply of hotel rooms  a reduction in demand for hotel space in specific areas  changes in travel patterns  weather conditions  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices or construction costs  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing for operating or capital needs  and changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses 
room supply and demand historically have been sensitive to shifts in gross domestic product growth  which has resulted in cyclical changes in adr and occupancy rates 
due in part to the strong correlation between the lodging industry s performance and economic conditions  the lodging industry is subject to cyclical changes in revenues 
in that regard  we cannot provide assurance that current conditions in the lodging industry  or in the segment of the industry in which we operate  will not decline in the future 
furthermore  the lodging industry is seasonal in nature  with revenues typically higher in summer months than in winter months 
fluctuations in and difficulty with lodging construction may have an adverse effect on us 
we may from time to time experience shortages of materials or qualified trades people or volatile increases in the cost of certain construction materials or labor  resulting in longer than normal construction and remodeling periods  loss of revenue and increased costs 
we will rely heavily on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized or understaffed 
the inability or failure of one or more local contractors to perform may result in construction or remodeling delays  increased cost and loss of revenue 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect la quinta s operations  which  in turn  could materially adversely affect us and our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness and to make distributions to shareholders 
the seasonality of the lodging industry may affect the ability of realty s lessees and operators to make timely rent payments 
the seasonality of the lodging industry causes fluctuations in hotel revenues and may  from time to time  affect either the amount of rent that accrues under realty s hotel leases or the ability of realty s lessees and operators to make timely rent payments under the leases 
a lessee s or operator s inability to make timely rent payments to realty could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
operating and or its subsidiaries currently are the only entities that lease realty s lodging properties 
we have recently implemented a franchising program for our various la quinta registered trademark brands and the success of this program may be impacted by risks inherent in third party use of our brands  as well as other factors 
the companies ownership of healthcare related properties exposes investors to risks common in that industry that may adversely affect an investment in our securities 
there are a number of operating risks that could have an adverse effect on the companies healthcare related business 
one of the companies businesses is that of financing and leasing healthcare related properties 
operating risks in this business include  among other things competition for tenants  changes in the financial condition of third party operators of our healthcare facilities  competition from other healthcare financing providers  a number of which may have greater marketing  financial and other resources and experience than us  changes in government regulation of healthcare  changes in the availability and cost of insurance coverage  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing  the ability of the companies to sell off its investments when it chooses at prices that are reasonable  and adverse effects on general and local economic conditions 
the foregoing factors could adversely affect the ability of the operators of the companies healthcare facilities to generate revenues and make payments to it 
this  in turn  could materially adversely affect our earnings  our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the healthcare industry may adversely affect the ability of third party operators of the companies healthcare properties to make their payments 
the healthcare businesses of the third party operators of the companies healthcare related real estate are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation governing the licensing and conduct of operations at healthcare facilities  certain capital expenditures  the quality of services provided  the manner in which the services are provided  financial and other arrangements between healthcare providers and reimbursement for services rendered 
the failure of any third party operator to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect its effectiveness in operating the facility or facilities 
any such ineffectiveness could impair such operator s ability to make payments to realty and thereby adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a concentration of investment in the skilled nursing industry compounds the risks associated with this industry 
as of december   skilled nursing facilities comprised of the companies real estate investments 
for the reasons mentioned in the risk factor above  such a concentration in this type of facility could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we rely heavily on third party operators associated with many of our properties 
third party operators manage healthcare facilities on each of our healthcare related properties 
our financial position may be adversely affected by financial difficulties experienced by any such operators  including the bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn in the business of any such operator  or in the event any such operator does not renew its leases as they expire and realty cannot lease these facilities to other operators on comparable terms 
in particular  the net book value of the companies investments in the facilities operated by its four largest healthcare operators at december  amounts to approximately of its total real estate investments 
such a concentration in these operators could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have no control over increased government regulation in the healthcare industry 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic  regulatory and demographic influences that may affect the operations of healthcare facilities and providers 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to changes in government regulation of many aspects of the industry for example  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
some elected officials have announced that they intend to examine certain aspects of the united states healthcare system  including proposals which may further increase governmental involvement in healthcare 
for example  the president and congress have in the past and may in the future  propose healthcare reforms which could impose additional regulations on the companies and its operators or limit the amounts that operators may charge for services 
the companies healthcare facility operators are and will continue to be  subject to varying degrees of regulation and licensing by health or social service agencies and other regulatory authorities in the various states and localities in which they operate or in which they will operate 
significant healthcare reform has and may continue to adversely affect our operations in the healthcare industry 
the balanced budget act of  which was signed into law on august   enacted significant changes to the medicare and medicaid programs designed to modernize payment and healthcare delivery systems while achieving substantial budgetary savings 
in seeking to limit medicare reimbursement for certain healthcare services  the balanced budget act of mandated the establishment of a prospective payment system for healthcare facilities to replace the current cost based reimbursement system 
the cost based system reimburses healthcare facilities for reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs incurred in providing routine services as well as capital costs and ancillary costs  subject to limits fixed for the particular geographic area served by the healthcare facility 
under the prospective payment system  healthcare facilities will be paid a federal per diem rate for covered services 
the per diem payment will cover routine service  ancillary and capital related costs 
the prospective payment system is being phased in over a four year period beginning on or after july  under provisions of the balanced budget act of  states will be provided additional flexibility in managing their medicaid program 
among other things  the balanced budget act of repealed a federal payment standard  which had required states to pay reasonable and adequate payments to cover the costs of efficiently and economically operated hospitals  nursing facilities and certain intermediate care facilities 
we have no control over these federal reimbursement rates  which may change periodically 
additionally  these healthcare reforms may reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care  which could adversely affect the revenues of realty s third party borrowers and lessees 
such adverse effects on realty s third party borrowers may negatively impact those borrowers and lessees abilities to make their loan or lease payments to realty 
five of realty s third party operators have cited these healthcare reforms as the precipitating factor in filing for bankruptcy protection 
failure of the borrowers or lessees to make their loan or lease payments would have a direct and material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
five of the companies healthcare facility operators have filed for bankruptcy 
as of december   the companies have exposure to five operators who have filed for protection under chapter sun healthcare group  inc sun  mariner health group mariner  integrated health services  inc integrated  genesis health ventures  inc genesis and carematrix corporation carematrix 
the following table describes the number of facilities  net assets before valuation allowance by lease mortgage and the lease mortgage income by each of the five operators that have filed for chapter year ended december  leases mortgages total net net rental interest operator date filed facilities facilities assets facilities assets income income in thousands  except for number of facilities sun    mariner   integrated   n a genesis     carematrix     totals     no interest payments related to the sun mortgages have been received since october  and  accordingly  these mortgages were placed on non accrual status 
no interest payments related to the mariner mortgage were received and  accordingly  this mortgage was placed on non accrual status 
mortgages related to genesis have been placed on non accrual status and interest income is recorded as payments are received 
mortgages related to carematrix have been placed on non accrual status and interest income is recorded as payments are received 
net lease assets operated by sun include straight line rent receivables of the companies continue to monitor its operators that have filed for chapter to date  the companies have not come to any definitive agreement with any of these operators 
in the event any of its leases are successfully rejected through the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  the companies intend to transition the operations of these facilities to other operators 
management has initiated various actions to protect the companies interests under its leases and mortgages including the draw down and renegotiations of certain escrow accounts and agreements 
while the earnings capacity of certain facilities has been reduced and the reductions may extend to future periods  management believes that it has recorded appropriate accounting impairment provisions based on its assessment of current circumstances 
however  upon changes in circumstances  including but not limited to  possible foreclosure or lease termination  there can be no assurance that the companies investments in healthcare facilities would not be written down below current carrying value based upon estimates of fair value at such time 
we cannot provide assurance that third party reimbursement for realty s operators will continue to be available 
the cost of many of the services offered by the current operators of realty s healthcare facilities are reimbursed or paid for by third party payors such as medicare and medicaid programs for elderly  low income and disabled patients and state medicaid programs for managed care organizations 
no assurance can be given that such third party reimbursement to realty s operators will continue to be available or when reimbursement will be offered or that reimbursement rates will not be reduced 
the increase in the number of providers contracting to provide per person fixed cost healthcare to a patient population has increased pressure on third party payers to lower costs 
a significant portion of the revenue from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from realty is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
these programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
in recent years  there have been fundamental changes in the medicare program resulting in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of healthcare services over which realty has no control 
moreover  healthcare facilities have experienced increasing pressure from private payors  such as health maintenance organizations  attempting to control healthcare costs 
reimbursement from private payors has  in many cases  been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors 
concern regarding healthcare costs may result in significant reductions in payment to healthcare facilities and there can be no assurance that future payment rates from either governmental or private healthcare plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are already insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect revenues from the third party operators who lease or receive financing from realty and thereby adversely affect those entities ability to make their lease or loan payments to realty 
failure of these entities to make their lease or loan payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and governmental program integrity regulations may have a material adverse effect on us 
in the past several years  due to rising healthcare costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
federal and state statutes generally prohibit payment of any remuneration to induce the referral of medicare and medicaid patients 
both federal and state self referral statutes severely restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
the balanced budget act of provided the federal government with expanded enforcement powers to combat waste  fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services 
in addition  the office of inspector general and the healthcare financing administration have increased investigation and enforcement activity of fraud and abuse  specifically targeting nursing homes  home health providers and medical equipment suppliers 
failure to comply with the foregoing fraud and abuse laws or government program integrity regulations may result in sanctions  including the loss of licensure or eligibility to participate in reimbursement programs including medicare and medicaid  asset forfeitures and civil and criminal penalties 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and informant activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
in the event that any borrower or lessee of the companies were to be found in violation of the applicable laws regarding fraud  abuse or self referral  that borrower s or lessee s license or certification to participate in government reimbursement programs could be jeopardized  or that borrower or lessee could be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties 
either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us by adversely affecting the borrower s or lessee s ability to make debt or lease payments to realty 
it is difficult to be continuously up to date with current information regarding third party operators of our healthcare properties 
as of december   our healthcare portfolio comprised approximately of our total real estate investments 
approximately of our total real estate investments approximately of the healthcare portfolio before the valuation allowance are operated by companies in the skilled nursing sector of the healthcare industry and of our total real estate investments approximately of the healthcare portfolio before the valuation allowance are operated by companies in the assisted living sector of the healthcare industry 
we monitor credit risk for our healthcare portfolio by evaluating a combination of publicly available financial information  information provided by the operators themselves and information otherwise available to us 
the financial condition and ability of these healthcare operators to meet their rental and other obligations will  among other things  have an impact on our revenues  net income or loss  funds available from operations  our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and our ability to obtain financing 
the operations of the skilled nursing companies have been negatively impacted by changes in medicare reimbursement rates  increases in labor costs  increases in their leverage and various other factors 
in addition  any failure by these operators to effectively conduct their operations could have a material adverse effect on their business reputation or on their ability to enlist and maintain patients in their facilities 
operators of assisted living and skilled nursing facilities are experiencing longer fill up periods and are being affected by concerns regarding the potential of over building  increased regulation and the use of certain accounting practices 
accordingly  many of these operators have pre announced anticipated earnings shortfalls and have experienced a significant decline in their stock prices 
these factors have had a detrimental impact on the liquidity of some assisted living operators  which has slowed or halted their growth plans and may have a negative effect on their operating cash flows 
our substantial debt  as well as the various other risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing  could result in adverse consequences for us 
we are dependent on external sources of capital 
to qualify as a reit  realty must distribute to its stockholders each year at least of its net taxable income commencing in  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that realty will be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital required for potential acquisitions  from income from operations 
realty  therefore  will have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors  including general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential and risk characteristics of our underlying business operations  our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests and additional debt financing may further leverage the companies 
realty is substantially leveraged 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately as of december  operating  as a guarantor under realty s credit facility  is also substantially leveraged 
this amount of debt could have important consequences for investors and for us  some of which include our ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired  both currently and in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on this indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal  interest or dividends  we may be substantially more leveraged than our competitors  putting us at a competitive disadvantage  and our flexibility to adjust to market conditions is limited  leaving us vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business 
despite our plan to decrease the amount of our debt as announced in the five point plan and our continuing efforts to do so  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to repay enough debt to successfully deleverage 
we have relied  and continue to rely  on the sale of healthcare assets in order to deleverage realty and a lack of continued success in these sales efforts may impair our ability to service or refinance our debt obligations 
since the announcement of the five point plan  realty has relied  and will continue to rely  significantly on the sale of healthcare assets to repay its indebtedness  including indebtedness under its credit facility which matures in july the sale of significant portions of healthcare assets is subject to a number of risks including the ability to identify satisfactory potential buyers  the availability of financing to potential buyers  the satisfactory completion of regulatory approvals and other factors which are outside of realty s control 
during the past several years  participants in the healthcare real estate industry have endured capital markets that have offered limited access to traditional financing vehicles 
regulatory changes  uncertainty in the industry and other factors have contributed to this reduction in available capital financing sources 
continuing limitations in the amount and type of capital which is available to the healthcare real estate industry may reduce the number of qualified buyers  impact the timing of asset sales or reduce the purchase prices at which prospective buyers are willing to acquire healthcare related real estate 
in the event realty is unable to continue to successfully sell healthcare assets on a timely basis and at prices which are acceptable to realty  its ability to satisfactorily service or refinance its debt obligations could be impaired 
realty may not be able to renew  repay or refinance when due the indebtedness on our properties or unsecured indebtedness or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of such original indebtedness 
if realty were unable to refinance the indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on such indebtedness 
realty has million in debt that matures in if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and realty is unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of revenues and asset value to us 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering realty s ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code 
we are subject to the risks associated with indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur  indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs to the extent that the related indebtedness was not protected by interest rate protection arrangements  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead our stockholders to demand a higher yield on their paired shares from our distributions  if any  which could adversely affect the market price for the paired shares and could also adversely affect the market price of any preferred stock issued by either or both of the companies 
realty s real property investments are subject to the many varying types and degrees of risk inherent in owning real estate and that may affect the value of our assets and our ability to generate revenue  net income and cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
the illiquidity of real estate as an investment limits realty s ability to sell properties quickly in response to market conditions 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  cannot be purchased or sold rapidly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
buyers may not be identified quickly or such buyers may not be able to secure suitable financing to consummate a transaction 
furthermore  sales of certain appreciated property could generate material adverse tax consequences  which may affect realty s ability to sell properties in response to market conditions and adversely affect returns to stockholders 
realty depends and relies on the ability and success of those who operate  manage  lease and maintain our properties 
federal income tax law restricts reits from deriving revenues directly from operating their properties 
thus  the underlying value of realty s real estate investments  results of operations and ability to make distributions to stockholders and pay amounts due on indebtedness depends on the ability of the operators  managers  lessees and operating to operate realty s properties in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient revenues in excess of operating expenses to make rent payments under their leases or loan payments in respect to their loans from realty 
the results of operations of realty s properties may be adversely affected by many factors outside of realty s control 
results of operations of realty s properties may also be adversely affected by  among other things changes in national economic conditions  changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of financing  the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws and other regulatory requirements  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in real estate tax rates and assessments and other operating expenses  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  adverse changes in zoning and other land use laws  and civil unrest  earthquakes and other natural disasters which may result in uninsured losses and other factors  which are beyond our control 
we depend on the rental income from our real property 
realty s cash flow  results of operations and the value of our assets would be adversely affected if a significant number of third party operators of our properties failed to meet their lease obligations 
these lease payments are one of realty s principal sources of revenue 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major operator may have an adverse effect on a property 
at any time  an operator also may seek protection under the bankruptcy laws  which could result in rejection and termination of such operator s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash flow from the property 
we have no control over such reductions and cannot assure investors that any of our third party operators will have sufficient assets  income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their obligations under any such lease 
if an operator rejects its lease  the owner s claim for breach of the lease would absent collateral securing the claim be treated as a general unsecured claim 
generally  the amount of the claim would be capped at the amount owed for unpaid pre petition lease payments unrelated to the rejection  plus the greater of one year s lease payments or of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease but not to exceed the amount of three years lease payments 
our operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on or under the property 
environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not such substances originated from the property 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate such property properly  may adversely affect our ability to use such real property as collateral in borrowing 
persons who arrange for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials  into the environment 
in addition  third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released asbestos containing materials or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the use or transfer of property and these restrictions may require various expenditures by realty 
in connection with the ownership and operation of any of realty s properties  we and the other lessees or operators of these properties may be liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
our failure to comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act of would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness  our business and our results of operations 
under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
a determination that we are not in compliance with the americans with disabilities act could result in the imposition of fines and or an award of damages to private litigants 
if we were required to make modifications to comply with the americans with disabilities act  there could be a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
our failure to obtain and maintain proper insurance on our properties would have a material adverse effect on us 
realty is directly responsible for insuring our lodging related properties 
additionally  each of realty s leases and mortgage loans typically specifies that comprehensive insurance be maintained on each of the applicable properties  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
leases and loan documents for new investments including those leased to operating typically contain similar provisions 
there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes and floods  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
we will use our discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
this may result in insurance coverage that  in the event of a substantial loss  would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the lost investment and also may result in certain losses being totally uninsured 
inflation  changes in building codes  zoning or other land use ordinances  environmental considerations  lender imposed restrictions and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds  if any  received by realty might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property 
an investment in our securities may have adverse tax consequences 
realty s failure to qualify as a reit could have serious adverse financial consequences 
realty operates and intends to continue to operate in the future  so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
realty believes that it has operated in a manner that permits it to qualify as a reit under the code 
qualification as a reit  however  involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions is greater in the case of a paired share reit 
in addition  reit qualification involves the determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  realty must derive at least of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources and realty must distribute annually to shareholders commencing in of its reit taxable income  excluding net taxable gains 
although we believe realty is organized and operating in a manner that permits it to remain qualified as a reit  we cannot guarantee that realty will be able to continue to operate in such a manner 
in addition  if we are ever audited by the internal revenue service irs with respect to any past year  the irs may challenge realty s qualification as a reit for such year 
if realty were to fail to qualify as a reit  it would be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
such failure to qualify as a reit would result in additional tax liability for the year or years involved 
this additional tax could significantly reduce  or possibly eliminate  the amount of cash realty would have available for investment or distribution to stockholders 
in addition  the failure to qualify as a reit would also constitute a default under certain of our debt obligations  which would generally allow the holders thereof to demand the immediate repayment of such indebtedness and potentially reduce the market value of our stock 
each of these possible outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
business developments and recent legislation complicate compliance with reit qualification rules 
due to recent sales of healthcare assets and the resulting loss of qualifying rental and interest income disqualifying income as a percentage of realty s gross income has increased 
disqualifying income cannot exceed of realty s gross income 
although realty currently satisfies this requirement  additional asset sales which will result in further reductions of qualifying rental and interest income as well as increases in royalty income which is considered nonqualifying income could cause realty to exceed the gross income limit for non qualifying income  resulting in reit disqualification and or substantial costs to avoid such disqualification 
in light of the five point plan and the companies announced intention to increase its focus on its lodging business including franchising  which will generate royalty income and sell a significant portion of its healthcare assets  the companies intend to continue to reevaluate its financial  legal and tax structure 
the ticket to work act replaced the former rule permitting a reit to own more than of the value of the securities of an issuer  provided the voting power of the security did not exceed  with a new rule prohibiting a reit from owning more than of the vote or value of the securities of an issuer unless such issuer qualifies as a taxable reit subsidiary 
taxable reit subsidiaries cannot  however  directly or indirectly operate or manage lodging or healthcare facilities and are limited in their ability to franchise or license brand names used in the operation of a lodging or healthcare facility 
in order to comply with these new rules  the companies may have to restructure their operations or limit their future growth 
any restructuring of the operations of realty and operating to comply with the above described legislation may cause one or both of the companies to incur substantial tax liabilities and other costs  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill asset related to the acquisition of the paired share structure or to take other actions that may otherwise adversely affect one or both of the companies 
legislation has limited the use of the paired share structure 
realty s ability to qualify as a reit is further dependent upon its continued exemption from the anti pairing rules of section b a of the code  which would ordinarily prevent it from qualifying as a reit 
subject to the discussion below regarding recent legislation  the grandfathering rules governing section b generally provide that section b a does not apply to a paired share reit if the reit and its paired operating company were paired on june  on june   realty then known as santa anita enterprises  inc was paired with operating which was then known as santa anita operating company 
there are  however  no judicial or administrative authorities interpreting this grandfathering rule 
moreover  if for any reason realty failed to qualify as a reit in  the benefit of the grandfathering rule would not be available to it  in which case realty would not qualify as a reit for any taxable year from and after such failure to qualify as a reit would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
on july   the president signed into law the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the reform act 
included in the reform act is a freeze on the grandfathered status of paired share reits 
under this legislation  the anti pairing rules provided in the code apply to real property interests we acquired after march  or acquired by a subsidiary or partnership in which a or greater interest we own  unless the real property interests are acquired pursuant to a written agreement that was binding on march  and at all times thereafter  or the acquisition of such real property interests was described in a public announcement or in a filing with the sec on or before march  these restrictions on the activities of a grandfathered paired share reit provided for in the reform act may in the future make it impractical or undesirable for us to continue to maintain our paired share structure 
restructuring our operations to comply with the rules provided by the reform act could cause us to incur tax liabilities  to recognize an impairment loss on their goodwill assets  or otherwise materially adversely affect us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
we may be limited in the amount and nature of our future growth under our present structure 
we operate as a so called paired share real estate investment trust and  as a result  are limited in the extent and types of activities in which we may engage 
realty operates and intends to continue to operate in the future so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  realty is limited in both the extent and type of assets which it can own and the extent and type of income which it can generate 
further  by restricting the activities that a paired share reit can engage in and by limiting the type of entities that a reit can own  the reform act and the ticket to work act  federal laws which were adopted in and  respectively  operate in conjunction to limit the ability of realty to grow through construction or acquisition of new lodging properties or the acquisition of other lodging brands or properties 
these restrictions will limit our ability to grow our overall business through the construction of additional lodging properties  the franchising of our la quinta registered trademark brand and related products and services and the acquisition of complementary brand names without significant restructuring efforts 
accordingly  we will need to continue to reevaluate our financial  legal and tax structure to determine the best platform for growing la quinta and enhancing shareholder value going forward 
we have no control over changes in legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions 
we can give no assurances that new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax law with respect to qualification as a reit and the federal income tax consequence of such qualification 
such legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay amounts due on our indebtedness 
in addition  this type of legislation could prevent us from growing as originally intended 
realty is subject to some taxes even if it qualifies as a reit 
even if realty qualifies as a reit  it is subject to some federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
for example  realty pays taxes on certain income it does not distribute 
also  realty s income derived from properties located in some states is subject to local taxes and  if realty enters into transactions that the code labels as prohibited transactions  realty s net income from such transactions would be subject to a tax 
the reit minimum distribution requirements may result in adverse consequences to investors 
realty may be subject to taxes in connection with the distribution of assets acquired in acquisitions 
in order to qualify as a reit  realty is generally required each year to distribute to its shareholders at least commencing in of its taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  if realty was to dispose of assets acquired in certain acquisitions during the ten year period following the acquisition  it would be required to distribute at least commencing in of the amount of any built in gain attributable to such assets that realty recognizes in the disposition  less the amount of any tax paid with respect to such recognized built in gain 
realty generally is subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which certain distributions paid by realty with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of realty s ordinary income for that year  of realty s capital gain net income for that year and of realty s undistributed income from prior years 
realty may need to borrow money to meet its minimum distribution requirements and to continue to qualify as a reit 
realty s ability to make distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected by increased debt service obligations if it needs to borrow money in order to maintain its reit qualification 
for example  differences in timing between when realty receives income and when it has to pay expenses could require realty to borrow money to meet the requirement that realty distributes to its shareholders at least commencing in of its net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains 
the incurrence of large expenses also could cause realty to need to borrow money to meet this requirement 
realty might need to borrow money for these purposes even if we believe that market conditions are not favorable for such borrowings and  therefore  we may borrow money on unfavorable terms 
realty s funds from operations and cash distributions may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based upon the market s perception of the reit s earnings growth potential  the companies debt levels and its current and potential future cash distributions and upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent realty retains operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common stock 
realty s failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future funds from operations  leverage ratios and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our publicly traded securities 
one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the distribution rate on such shares  as a percentage of the price of such shares relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of our equity securities may expect a higher dividend yield 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for realty to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease cash available for distribution to the extent that our indebtedness has floating interest rates 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our publicly traded securities to go down 
provisions of our charters and bylaws could inhibit changes in control that could be beneficial to our shareholders 
certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide our shareholders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of their paired shares or which might otherwise be in their best interests 
these include a staggered board of directors as well as the ownership limitations in each of our respective amended and restated certificates of incorporation 
we depend on our key personnel 
we depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
while we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations
