general and background we develop and market biologic solutions for the repair  replacement and preservation of human tissue 
our core technology removes all cells from the tissue and preserves the tissue without damaging the essential biochemical and structural components necessary for normal tissue regeneration 
we currently market three products based on this technology alloderm r for plastic reconstructive  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra tm  a version of alloderm in particulate form for the correction of soft tissue defects  and repliform tm  a version of alloderm for urology and gynecology procedures 
our development programs include the application of our technology to process small diameter blood vessel grafts as an alternative to blood vessel grafts taken from the patient  investigation of potential orthopedic applications of our technology  investigation of human tissues as carriers for therapeutics  thrombosol tm  a formulation for extended storage of platelets and technologies to enhance the storage of red blood cells for transfusion 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to approximately million compared to approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in product revenues to approximately million in the current year as compared to approximately million in the prior year 
the increase in product revenues was largely due to the full commercial launch of two new products  repliform  a version of alloderm for urology and gynecology surgical procedures  and cymetra  a version of alloderm in particulate form for non surgical plastic reconstructive procedures 
we initiated the full commercial launch of repliform in january and cymetra in june repliform and cymetra product sales contributed approximately million and approximately million  respectively  in total revenue was further impacted by an increase in funded research grant revenues of approximately million from  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in research grant funding available 
we have engaged boston scientific corporation as our exclusive worldwide sales and marketing representative for repliform for use in the urology and gynecology markets and obagi medical products  inc as the exclusive sales and marketing representative of cymetra for office based dermatologists and plastic surgeons 
during  sales of our products through boston scientific corporation and obagi medical products represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues 
we expect sales of our products through such marketing agents to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
both boston scientific and obagi medical products are paid fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
such fees are recorded as selling and marketing expenses 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of goods sold of approximately million  or for the same period in the increase in costs as a percentage of product revenue was principally attributable to increased costs associated with the expansion of tissue processing capacity in our new facility and costs incurred in this year related to the scale up of cymetra production 
total research and development expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the increase was due primarily to higher expenditures for cymetra product development and technology transfer to commercial production and increased spending on orthopedic program research  which is funded through a research grant 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the increase was principally due to a combination of increased professional fees  higher salary costs relating to the hiring of management personnel during the second half of which continued for the full year and  of settlement costs and legal fees associated with the settlement of the lawsuit with inamed corporation all of which were incurred in selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel during the second half of which continued for the full year  increased promotion expenses associated with the expansion of marketing activities including the commercial launch of two new products and the agency fees associated with the sales and marketing agreements with boston scientific and obagi medical products 
during the year ended december   in connection with the relocation of our operations from texas to new jersey  we incurred approximately million of relocation costs consisting principally of non relocating employee benefits  asset abandonment costs and costs to relocate key employees 
relocation costs for the year ended december   were  consisting of  of retention bonus and  of relocation costs  which were included in cost of goods sold and general and administrative expenses  respectively 
the relocation from texas to new jersey was completed in june interest and other income expense  net decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the net decrease was due to a  decline in interest income resulting from a lower cash balance available for investment and a  increase in interest expense resulting from an increase in revolving and long term debt 
the net loss for the year ended december  decreased to approximately million compared to approximately million in as discussed above  the net loss in the prior year included approximately million of expenses associated with our relocation from texas to new jersey 
years ended december  and total revenues for the year ended december  increased to approximately million compared to approximately million in product revenues increased approximately million as a result of expanded sales and marketing activities and increased distribution activities during the year 
funded research grant revenues remained consistent at  in compared to  in cost of products sold for the year ended december   was approximately million  resulting in a gross margin of approximately 
the gross margin for the year ended december   was approximately 
the increase in gross margin was principally attributable to an increase in sales of certain higher margin alloderm products and an increase in the price of certain alloderm products in research and development expenses for the year ended december   increased to approximately million compared to approximately million in the increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to increased animal and clinical studies for the expanding uses for alloderm 
in addition  we dedicated increased resources to product development programs such as micronized alloderm tm 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased to approximately million compared to approximately in the increase was attributable to recruiting and staffing costs incurred in connection with the recruitment of new key members of senior management and professional fees incurred in relation to a distribution agreement entered into during selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of domestic sales and marketing personnel and the expansion of marketing activities during in june  we commenced relocation of our operations from texas to new jersey and at june   had approximately employees operating from temporary offices in new jersey 
the original target completion date for the relocation was december  all administrative functions including accounting  customer service  information services  regulatory  marketing and research and development functions were moved to new jersey prior to december  we commenced processing operations in new jersey during the first quarter of relocation costs of approximately million charged to operations for the year ended december   included the cost of non relocating employee benefits  asset abandonment and lease termination costs related to our texas facility  as well as the cost of relocating key employees to new jersey 
in order to induce non relocating employees to continue their employment during the relocation process  employees were offered a retention bonus  which was only payable  if they continued their employment until various targeted dates during if the employee resigned prior to such date  they forfeited their retention bonus 
such bonus payments were expensed at the time that they were paid 
during the fourth quarter of  because all remaining employees had continued employment through their targeted termination date  the continuing employment condition was waived and we recorded a bonus accrual of approximately  due to these employees as of december  such amounts were paid out in additional retention bonuses of approximately  paid in were expensed when incurred 
in june  we recorded a charge of approximately  representing the net book value of assets that were abandoned in the second quarter of when we vacated our administrative offices located in texas 
in texas we occupied rented office and manufacturing space pursuant to a lease that extended through january during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately  representing rent and other facility related expenses related to the termination of the texas lease 
no charge was recorded prior to the fourth quarter of  because we had not committed to a specific course of action for exiting the lease of the texas facility and accordingly  such costs were not quantifiable 
the costs of relocating key employees to new jersey were approximately million in and consisted of home sale and purchase assistance  moving expense  travel and temporary housing 
we also incurred approximately  of non employee related moving costs 
interest income and other  net decreased to approximately  for the year ended december   compared to approximately  in the decrease was principally attributable to a reduction of funds available for investing activities during the net loss for the year ended december   increased to approximately million compared to approximately million for as discussed above  the net loss in included approximately million of expenses associated with our relocation from texas to new jersey 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million compared to million at december  the increase resulted principally from cash provided by a private placement of million shares of our common stock  debt financing and stock option and warrant exercises offset by cash required to fund the operating loss for the year ended december   increases in accounts receivable and inventories and capital expenditures 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted principally from increases in cash and increases in accounts receivable and inventories net of an increase in current maturities of long term debt 
in october  we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock with selected accredited investors at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the private placement were approximately million  after deducting placement agent fees and offering costs 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  to fund our operating loss for the period  net of non cash charges  and increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
the increase in inventories was primarily associated with the launch of cymetra 
the increase in accounts receivable was related to the increase in revenues 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of approximately million for the purchase of capital equipment and leasehold improvements relating to the completion of the new jersey facility 
our financing activities provided million for the year ended december   primarily from net proceeds of the private placement of approximately million  after deducting placement agent fees and offering costs  long term debt proceeds of million and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
such proceeds were partially offset by cash dividends paid on the series b preferred stock during the period and principal payments on long term debt 
at december   we had an aggregate of approximately million outstanding under our borrowing arrangements  including approximately million outstanding under a revolving loan facility which is due in january the term loans require aggregate principal payments over the next months of approximately million 
we currently have no additional borrowing availability through our existing credit facilities 
we expect to incur additional operating losses as well as negative cash flow from operations in the short term as we continue to expand marketing efforts with respect to our current products and to continue our product development programs 
our ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operations will depend on increased market acceptance of our current products and our ability to commercialize products currently under development 
we expect that our current resources  together with anticipated product revenues and research and development grant funding  will satisfy our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our needs and as a result  we may need additional funding to operate our business 
we have no commitments for any future funding and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding from either debt or equity financing  bank loans  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we expect that we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our product development programs 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
it is possible that our results of operations or liquidity and capital resources could be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or as a result of the cost of contesting such legal actions 
for a discussion of these matters see note of notes to financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings 
we have incurred losses since our inception and therefore have not been subject to federal income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively  available to reduce future federal income taxes 
federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards generated prior to certain ownership changes that could limit our ability to use nol and tax credit carryforwards 
our public offering of common stock in resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
we estimate that the amount of nol carryforwards and the credits available to offset federal taxable income subsequent to the ownership change are approximately million on a cumulative basis 
accordingly  if we generate taxable income in any year in excess of the then cumulative limitation  we may be required to pay federal income taxes even though we have unexpired nol carryforwards 
in addition  we have nol s available for state income tax purposes of approximately million  available to reduce future state income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our debt arrangements and  secondarily  from our investments in certain securities 
although our short term investments are available for sale  we generally hold such investments until maturity 
we do not utilize derivative instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
