interest and other income decreased by  or in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payoff of a mortgage loan and the partial payoff of another mortgage loan during the year partially offset by the interest on the note receivable from beverly discussed below 
additional rent and additional interest increased by  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased additional rent and additional interest based on increases in the facility revenues or the consumer price index pursuant to the company s existing leases and mortgage loans receivable  partially offset by the shift in the characterization of additional rent to minimum rent discussed above 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  in fixed rate medium term notes during  the interest on which is now included for a full year  increases in the average interest rates on the company s  bank line of credit and a reduction in interest capitalized on construction projects  partially offset by the repayment of  of fixed rate medium term notes during the year 
depreciation and non cash charges increased  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation on the developments completed in  a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in and depreciation adjustments  partially offset by the disposal of facilities during general and administrative costs increased  or in as compared to due to increases in legal fees related to three operators in bankruptcy  general cost increases and additional costs associated with the company s larger asset base 
effective january   the company negotiated a new lease and settlement with beverly that incorporates of its facilities leased to beverly  most of which were up for renewal in the other facilities leased to beverly are on a separate lease that does not expire until the new lease provides for an initial five year lease term for of the facilities 
as part of the renewal settlement  of the facilities as well as other facilities that beverly had previously subleased to other operators were returned to beverly 
the renewal settlement included a promissory note of approximately  that bears interest at and requires beverly to make quarterly payments through its final maturity on december  the future revenues related to the promissory note will decrease as the company receives the quarterly principal payments 
pursuant to the settlement  beverly was to operate the remaining facilities at reduced rentals until the earlier of january  or the date the company was able to lease the facilities to new operators 
as of december   the company has leased of these facilities to new operators  has decided to sell for which it expects to receive approximately book value and anticipates having a new operator in place at the remaining facility by march  at a rental rate approximately equal to that currently being paid by beverly  however  there is no guarantee that a new operator will be in place by that date  that the company will receive a rental rate equal to the rental currently being paid by beverly  or that the company will actually receive book value for the facilities it intends to sell 
the company expects increased rental revenues and interest income due to the addition of facilities to its property base and mortgage loans receivable over the last twelve months 
the company also expects increased additional rent and additional interest at individual facilities because the company s leases and mortgages generally contain provisions under which additional rents or interest income increase with increases in facility revenues and or increases in the consumer price index 
historically  revenues at the company s facilities and the consumer price index generally have increased  although there are no assurances that they will continue to increase in the future 
sales of facilities or repayments of mortgages would serve to offset the aforementioned revenue increases  and if sales and repayments exceed additional investments this would actually reduce revenues 
the company expects that additional rent and additional interest may decrease due to lease renewals that may result in a shift in the characterization of revenue from additional rent to minimum rent 
there is no assurance that leases will renew at the aggregate existing rent level  so the impact of lease renewals may be a decrease in the total rent received by the company 
additional investments in health care facilities would also increase rental and or interest income 
as additional investments in facilities are made  depreciation and or interest expense would also increase 
any such increases  however  are expected to be at least partially offset by rents or interest income associated with the investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  minimum rent increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to minimum rent resulting from the developments completed during  combined with a full year of revenues earned by investments in additional facilities in interest and other income increased by  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to approximately  of working capital loans provided during additional rent and additional interest increased by  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased additional rent and additional interest as provided in the company s existing leases and mortgage loans receivable based on increases in the facility revenues or the consumer price index 
interest and amortization of deferred financing costs increased  or in as compared to the increase was primarily due to the issuance of  in medium term notes during  a full year of interest expense related to the issuance of  of medium term notes in and a rise in interest rates during depreciation and non cash charges increased  or in as compared to the increase was attributable to increased depreciation due to the developments completed in and a full year of depreciation related to facilities acquired in general and administrative costs increased  or in as compared to due to general cost increases and additional costs associated with the company s larger asset base 
information regarding certain operators over leveraging and changes in reimbursement levels during have had an adverse impact on the financial performance of some of the companies that operate nursing homes owned by the company 
three operators have filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy laws 
the table below summarizes the filing dates of the bankruptcies  the number of the company s owned facilities operated by each operator  the company s investment in facilities subject to the bankruptcies  the percentage of the company s revenue for relating to the facilities operated by each operator and cash deposits and letters of credit currently held by the company as security for each operator number of percentage bankruptcy facilities investment of security operator filing date operated in facilities revenue deposits mariner post acute network january    sun healthcare group  inc october    integrated health services  inc february    totals   under bankruptcy statutes  the tenant must either assume the company s leases or reject them and return the properties to the company 
if the tenant assumes the leases  it is required to assume the leases under the existing terms  the court cannot change the rental amount or other lease provisions that could financially impact the company 
the tenant s decision whether to assume leases usually is based primarily on whether the properties that are operated by the tenant are providing positive cash flows 
only a few of the facilities leased to and operated by these three companies are not providing adequate cash flows on their own to cover the rent under the leases 
the company s rent has been paid each month on a timely basis 
while there is a possibility that the tenants may decide to reject the leases on these properties  the company has identified parties interested in leasing these facilities  however such leases may be at a lower rental rate 
in addition to the above  the company has one mortgage loan directly with mariner post acute network in the amount of  that is secured by one facility 
the revenues from this mortgage loan represent approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  and the mortgage loan is secured by a cash deposit in the amount of  the company has not received any payments on this mortgage loan subsequent to march under bankruptcy statutes  the court imposes an automatic stay with respect to the company s actions to collect or pursue remedies with respect to mortgage loans and the company is precluded from exercising foreclosure or other remedies against the borrower 
unlike a lease  a mortgage loan is not subject to assumption or rejection 
the mortgage loan may be divided into i a secured loan for the portion of the mortgage loan that does not exceed the value of the property and ii an unsecured loan for the portion of the mortgage loan that exceeds the value of the property  which unsecured portion would be treated like general unsecured claims in the bankruptcy estate 
the company would only be entitled to the recovery of interest and costs if and to the extent that the value of the collateral exceeds the amount owed 
in addition  the courts may modify the terms of a mortgage  including the rate of interest and timing of principal payments 
in december  balanced care corporation bcc notified the company that it would only be making a partial payment of its december rent 
the company leased facilities  in which its investment was approximately  located in states in the eastern united states that were all constructed and opened during and to bcc under two master leases 
the company immediately declared bcc in default under its master leases and initiated steps to terminate the leases 
bcc agreed to return the facilities to the company and the leases were terminated effective as of january  the company has identified a new operator who it anticipates will take over the operations of the facilities effective as of january  at lease rates essentially the same as those previously paid by bcc of approximately  per month 
bcc is managing the facilities on an interim basis on the company s behalf until the facility licenses can be transferred to the name of the new operator 
the company will avail itself of cash security deposits totaling approximately  to cover the december rent and other costs incurred related to the default 
the replacement of operators that have defaulted on lease or loan obligations could be delayed by the approval process of any regulatory agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator licensed to operate the facility 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company provided new construction financing of approximately  construction of five assisted living facilities was completed in  in which the company s total aggregate investment was approximately   of this amount was a current year investment included in the new construction financing amount above 
upon completion of construction  the facilities were concurrently leased under terms generally similar to the company s existing leases 
during  the company also funded approximately  in capital improvements at certain facilities in accordance with certain existing lease provisions 
such capital improvements result in an increase in the minimum rents the company earns on these facilities 
the company funded the construction advances and capital improvement advances with borrowings on the company s bank line of credit and cash on hand 
during  the company sold six skilled nursing facilities  two assisted living facilities and one residential care facility for the elderly in six separate transactions for aggregate proceeds of approximately  the company recognized an aggregate gain of  related to the disposal of these facilities 
the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings on the company s bank line of credit 
during  a loan with a net book value of approximately  secured by three skilled nursing facilities was repaid 
in addition  a  portion of one of the mortgage loans secured by one skilled nursing facility was also repaid 
the company used the proceeds to repay borrowings on the company s bank line of credit 
during  the company repaid  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes 
the notes bore fixed interest at a weighted average interest rate of 
the company funded the repayment with borrowings on the company s bank line of credit and cash on hand 
the company has  of medium term notes maturing in that it anticipates repaying with a combination of cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings on the company s bank line of credit and potentially with any mortgage loans receivable payoffs received or the issuance of additional medium term notes under the shelf registrations discussed below 
at december   the company had  available under its  unsecured bank line of credit 
during the second quarter  the bank line of credit was amended  resulting in an extension of the maturity by one year to march  the amendment also modified the rates and covenants under the bank line of credit 
at the option of the company  borrowings under the bank line of credit bear interest at prime or libor plus 
the company pays a facility fee of 
per annum on the total commitment under the bank line of credit 
under covenants contained in the credit agreement  the company is required to maintain  among other things i a minimum net worth of  ii a ratio of cash flow before interest expense and non cash expenses to regularly scheduled debt service payments on all debt of at least to  iii a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of not more than to  and iv a gross asset value coverage ratio of at least to the company has shelf registrations on file with the securities and exchange commission under which the company may issue a up to  in aggregate principal amount of medium term notes and b up to  of securities including debt  convertible debt  common and preferred stock 
the company may make additional investments in healthcare related facilities 
however  the level of the company s new investments has decreased and the company does not anticipate making additional investments beyond its current commitments until such time as access to equity capital is under more favorable terms 
financing for future investments by the company may be provided by borrowings under the company s bank line of credit  private placements or public offerings of debt or equity  and the assumption of secured indebtedness 
the company anticipates the repayment of certain mortgages and the possible sale of certain facilities during in the event that there are mortgage repayments or facility sales in excess of new investments  revenues may decrease 
the company anticipates using the proceeds from any mortgage repayments or facility sales to reduce the outstanding balance on the company s bank line of credit 
any such reduction would result in reduced interest expense that the company believes would partially offset any decrease in revenues 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and financing capability to finance anticipated future investments  maintain its current dividend level and repay borrowings at or prior to their maturity 
impact of new accounting pronouncements during the fourth quarter of  the company was required to adopt sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

the sec considers this pronouncement to be a clarification of existing authoritative literature regarding revenue recognition  specifically regarding when revenue becomes earned and realizable 
sab no 
provides guidance on revenue recognition in various situations  however the portion that is relevant to the company relates to the recognition of contingent rental income 
the pronouncement states that contingent rental income should be recognized as revenue when the change in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occurs 
many of the company s leases are structured so that the factor on which the contingent lease payments in the company s leases are based is patient revenues in excess of base revenues 
sab no 
requires that additional rent not be recognized in the company s financial statements until the customer s patient revenues for the lease year exceed the total base revenue amount 
this differs from the company s historical method of recognizing a portion of the contingent lease payments as they became calculable and payable on a quarterly basis in accordance with the company s lease provisions based on a percentage of revenues in excess of base amounts for the prorated portion of the lease year completed 
the impact of this pronouncement is mitigated in part by the fact that most of the company s leases contain provisions that do not allow total rent to decrease from one year to the next 
sab no 
requires that the company adopt its provisions retroactively to january  and show a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of that date 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements for the year ended december   and did not result in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle being recorded as of january  while the impact was immaterial for the year ended december   sab no 
does cause a change in the additional rent amounts reported in the company s quarterly reports on form q for the first  second and third quarters of these differences are reconciled in note to the company s financial statements for the year ended december  the company expects that the timing of the recognition of additional rent and interest in future quarterly periods may fluctuate due to the provisions of sab no 
market risk exposure the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its mortgage loans receivable and debt 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analyses is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in the market risk exposure paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading statement regarding forward looking disclosure set forth above 
the company provides mortgage loans to operators of healthcare facilities as part of its normal operations 
the majority of the loans have fixed rates 
four of the mortgage loans have adjustable rates  however  the rates adjust only once or twice over the term of the loans and the minimum adjusted rate is equal to the current rate 
therefore  all mortgage loans receivable are treated as fixed rate notes in the table and analysis below 
the company utilizes debt financing primarily for the purpose of making additional investments in healthcare facilities 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings on its bank line of credit to fund its acquisitions and construction projects until market conditions were appropriate  based on management s judgment  to issue stock or fixed rate debt to provide long term financing 
a portion of the company s secured debt is variable rate debt in the form of housing revenue bonds  which were assumed in connection with the acquisition of certain healthcare facilities 
pursuant to the associated lease arrangements  increases or decreases in the interest rates on the housing revenue bonds would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the rent received by the company on the properties securing this debt 
therefore  there is substantially no market risk associated with the company s variable rate secured debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  and including the bank borrowings as variable rate debt due to its nature  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for the mortgage loans receivable and debt for each category based on the final maturity dates 
certain of the mortgage loans receivable and certain items in the various categories of debt require periodic principal payments prior to the final maturity date 
the fair value estimates for the mortgage loans receivable are based on the estimates of management and on rates currently prevailing for comparable loans 
the fair market value estimates for debt securities are based on discounting future cash flows utilizing current rates offered to the company for debt of the same type and remaining maturity 
maturity date fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans receivable        average interest rate liabilities debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate    average interest rate bank borrowings    average interest rate increases in interest rates during resulted in an increase in interest expense for the company primarily related to the bank line of credit and medium term notes issued during the year at rates somewhat higher than in prior years 
increases in interest rates during have resulted in an additional increase in interest expense related to the company s bank line of credit 
these interest rate increases have made it more expensive for the company to borrow on its bank line of credit and to access debt capital through its medium term note program 
any future interest rate increases will further increase the cost of any borrowings to refinance current long term debt as it matures or finance future acquisitions
