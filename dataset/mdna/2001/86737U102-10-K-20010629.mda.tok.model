we understand that industry analysts generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the financial performance of a corporation that is presented to assist investors in analyzing the operating performance of a corporation and its ability to service debt 
we believe an increase in ebitda level is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
given that ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations
