depreciation on rental equipment in increased million over due to additional rental equipment purchased during and the average modular rental equipment  at cost  increased million and average electronics rental equipment  at cost  increased million over other direct costs of rental operations increased million over primarily due to the million of impairment losses recorded on rental equipment that was beyond economic repair and increased maintenance and repair expenses of the modular fleet

backlog is not significant in mmmc s modular business or in rentelco s electronic business 
selling and administrative expenses in increased million over the increase is due primarily to increases in salaries  incentive and performance bonuses  benefits and hiring costs during as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses for remained consistent with interest expense in increased million over as a result of higher debt levels and higher average interest rates over a year earlier

excluding the impact of the one time accounting charge  net income for would have been million or per diluted share resulting in comparative net income increasing and diluted earnings per share increasing in fiscal years and as anticipated  during increased revenues from rental operations significantly offset the decline in sales revenues

rental revenues increased million over  with mmmc contributing million and rentelco contributing million of the increase 
as of december   rental equipment on rent increased for mmmc by million and for rentelco by million compared to a year earlier 
even though average utilization for modulars  excluding new equipment not previously rented  decreased from in to in  the annual yield declined for modulars from to as a result of lower rental rates due to competition 
average utilization for electronics declined slightly from in to in with electronics annual yield declining from in to in resulting primarily from competitive pricing pressures 
rental related services revenues in increased million  over as a result of a higher volume of modular equipment movements and site requirements in gross margins on these services increased from in to in sales in declined million primarily due to a reduction in sales of manufactured classrooms by enviroplex to school districts from the high levels in caused by california s class size reduction program 
further  increased business levels for enviroplex anticipated from the billion california bond measure  which passed in november  did not materialize in the single largest sale in was by enviroplex for million of new classrooms to a school district 
sales occur routinely as a normal part of the company s rental business  however  these sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on customer demands  requirements and funding 
consolidated gross margin on sales declined slightly from in to in due to the lower margin classroom projects sold during enviroplex s backlog of orders as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
backlog is not significant in mmmc s modular business or in rentelco s electronic business 
depreciation on rental equipment in increased million over due to additional rental equipment purchased during the average modular rental equipment  at cost  increased million and average electronics rental equipment  at cost  increased million over other direct costs of rental operations increased  over primarily due to increased maintenance and repair expenses of the modular fleet 
additionally  during as in the prior year  a significant number of school customers opted to include upfront charges in the rental rate resulting in higher amortization expense of these related upfront costs over the lease term in subsequent periods 
selling and administrative expenses in increased  over during  the company repurchased  shares of stock at per share from an employee who had acquired the stock at per share through the exercise of a stock option  resulting in the recognition of a noncash compensation expense of  interest expense in increased  over as a result of higher average borrowing levels in offset by a lower weighted average interest rate 
the debt increase funded part of the significant rental equipment purchases made during income before provision for taxes in decreased million from while net income before effect of the accounting change only decreased  less than from the lower percentage decrease for net income before effect of the accounting change is due to the decrease in the minority interest in income of enviroplex combined with a lower effective tax rate in of compared to in as more business is derived outside of california
