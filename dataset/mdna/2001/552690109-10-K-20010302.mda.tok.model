system supply and system demand through an interconnected electric system  montana dakota serves markets in portions of the following states and major communities western north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson and williston  eastern montana  including glendive and miles city  and northern south dakota  including mobridge 
the interconnected system consists of seven on line electric generating stations which have an aggregate turbine nameplate rating attributable to montana dakota s interest of  kilowatts kw and a total summer net capability of  kw 
montana dakota s four principal generating stations are steam turbine generating units using coal for fuel 
the nameplate rating for montana dakota s ownership interest in these four stations including interests in the big stone station and the coyote station aggregating percent and percent  respectively is  kw 
the balance of montana dakota s interconnected system electric generating capability is supplied by three combustion turbine peaking stations 
additionally  montana dakota has contracted to purchase through october    kw of participation power annually from basin electric power cooperative for its interconnected system 
the following table sets forth details applicable to the company s electric generating stations net generation nameplate summer kilowatt generating rating capability hours in station type kw kw thousands north dakota coyote steam    heskett steam    williston combustion turbine   south dakota big stone steam    montana lewis clark steam    glendive combustion turbine    miles city combustion turbine    reflects montana dakota s ownership interest 
station use  to meet mapp s accreditation requirements  exceeded generation 
virtually all of the current fuel requirements of the coyote  heskett and lewis clark stations are met with coal supplied by knife river under various long term contracts 
the majority of the big stone station s fuel requirements are currently being met with coal supplied by kennecott energy company under a contract which expires on december  during the years ended december   through december   the average cost of coal purchased  including freight  per million british thermal units btu at montana dakota s electric generating stations including the big stone and coyote stations in the interconnected system and the average cost per ton  including freight  of the coal purchased was as follows years ended december  average cost of coal per million btu 




average cost of coal per ton the maximum electric peak demand experienced to date attributable to sales to retail customers on the interconnected system was  kw in august montana dakota s latest forecast for its interconnected system indicates that its annual peak will continue to occur during the summer and the peak demand growth rate through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota s latest forecast indicates that its kilowatt hour kwh sales growth rate  on a normalized basis  through will approximate percent annually 
montana dakota currently estimates that  with modifications already made and those expected to be made  it has adequate capacity available through existing generating stations and long term firm purchase contracts until the year if additional capacity is needed in or after  it is expected to be met through the addition of combustion turbine peaking stations and purchases from the mid continent area power pool mapp on an intermediate term basis 
montana dakota has major interconnections with its neighboring utilities  all of which are mapp members 
montana dakota considers these interconnections adequate for coordinated planning  emergency assistance  exchange of capacity and energy and power supply reliability 
through a separate electric system sheridan system  montana dakota serves sheridan  wyoming and neighboring communities 
the maximum peak demand experienced to date and attributable to montana dakota sales to retail consumers on that system was approximately  kw and occurred in december the sheridan system is supplied through an interconnection with black hills power and light company under a power supply contract through december  which allows for the purchase of up to  kw of capacity annually 
regulation and competition the electric utility industry can be expected to continue to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
the ferc  in its order no 
 has required that utilities provide open access and comparable transmission service to third parties 
in addition  as a result of competition in electric generation  wholesale power markets have become increasingly competitive and evaluations are ongoing concerning retail competition 
in march  the mapp  of which montana dakota is a member  filed a restated operating agreement with the ferc 
the ferc approved mapp s restated agreement  excluding mapp s market based rate proposal  effective november in  the ferc approved mapp s request to use each member s individual market based tariffs which were already on file and approved by the ferc 
in december  the ferc issued its order in which it prescribed certain minimum characteristics of and functions to be performed by regional transmission organizations rtos 
montana dakota has been actively pursuing its options for voluntary participation in a ferc approved rto that would become operational by december  as required by order  montana dakota filed a report with the ferc in october in which it described its efforts to join an rto and explained its reasons for not proposing to join an rto at that time 
montana dakota is continuing to pursue its options to join a ferc approved rto  but for economic and operational reasons  it has been unable to commit to joining a specific rto 
the montana legislature passed an electric industry restructuring bill  effective may  the bill provides for full customer choice of electric supplier by july   stranded cost recovery and other provisions 
on december   the mtpsc extended this date to july   for those customers  primarily residential and small commercial  that do not have a choice of  or have not yet chosen  an electricity supplier 
mtpsc cited the fact that montana customers would be disadvantaged due to the lack of a competitive electricity supply market 
based on the provisions of such restructuring bill  because montana dakota operates in more than one state  the company has the option of deferring its transition to full customer choice until legislation has been proposed in montana which would delay the restructuring and transition to full customer choice until a time that montana dakota can reasonably implement customer choice in the state of its primary service territory 
in its legislative session  the north dakota legislature established an electric industry competition committee to study over a six year period the impact of competition on the generation  transmission and distribution of electric energy in north dakota 
in  the wypsc selected a consultant to perform a study on the impact of electric restructuring in wyoming 
the study found no material economic benefits 
no further action is pending at this time 
the sdpuc has not initiated any proceedings to date concerning retail competition or electric industry restructuring 
federal legislation addressing this issue continues to be discussed 
although montana dakota is unable to predict the outcome of such regulatory proceedings or legislation  or the extent to which retail competition may occur  montana dakota is continuing to take steps to effectively operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
fuel adjustment clauses contained in north dakota and south dakota jurisdictional electric rate schedules allow montana dakota to reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs excluding demand charges on a timely basis 
expedited rate filing procedures in wyoming allow montana dakota to timely reflect increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs 
in montana percent of electric revenues  such cost changes are includible in general rate filings 
environmental matters montana dakota s electric operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations providing for air  water and solid waste pollution control  state facility siting regulations  zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities  federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards 
montana dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations 
governmental regulations establishing environmental protection standards are continuously evolving and  therefore  the character  scope  cost and availability of the measures which will permit compliance with these laws or regulations  cannot be accurately predicted 
montana dakota did not incur any significant environmental expenditures in and does not expect to incur any significant capital expenditures related to environmental compliance through natural gas distribution general montana dakota sells natural gas at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system 
great plains  acquired july  sells natural gas at retail  serving over  residential  commercial and industrial customers located in communities and adjacent rural areas as of december   and provides natural gas transportation services to certain customers on its system 
these services for the two public utility divisions are provided through distribution systems aggregating over  miles 
montana dakota and great plains have obtained and hold valid and existing franchises authorizing them to conduct natural gas distribution operations in all of the municipalities they serve where such franchises are required

the natural gas distribution operations of montana dakota are subject to regulation by the ndpsc  mtpsc  sdpuc and wypsc regarding retail rates  service  accounting and  in certain instances  security issuances 
the natural gas distribution operations of great plains are subject to regulation by the ndpsc and minnesota public utilities commission regarding retail rates  service  accounting and  in certain instances  security issuances 
the percentage of montana dakota s and great plains natural gas utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows north dakota percent  minnesota percent  montana percent  south dakota percent and wyoming percent operating revenues for great plains are for the period july through december 
system supply  system demand and competition montana dakota and great plains serve retail natural gas markets  consisting principally of residential and firm commercial space and water heating users  in portions of the following states and major communities north dakota  including bismarck  dickinson  wahpeton  williston  minot and jamestown  western minnesota  including fergus falls  marshall and crookston  eastern montana  including billings  glendive and miles city  western and north central south dakota  including rapid city  pierre and mobridge  and northern wyoming  including sheridan 
these markets are highly seasonal and sales volumes depend on the weather 
the following table reflects this segment s natural gas sales  natural gas transportation volumes and degree days as a percentage of normal during the last five years years ended december  mdk thousands of decatherms sales residential      commercial      industrial  total      transportation commercial      industrial      total      total throughput      degree days of normal note sales and transportation volumes for great plains are for the period july through december degree days exclude great plains 
the restructuring of the natural gas industry  as described under pipeline and energy services  has resulted in additional competition in retail natural gas markets 
in response to these changed market conditions  montana dakota and great plains have established various natural gas transportation service rates for their distribution businesses to retain interruptible commercial and industrial load 
certain of these services include transportation under flexible rate schedules whereby montana dakota s and great plains interruptible customers can avail themselves of the advantages of open access transportation on regional transmission pipelines  including the system of williston basin interstate pipeline company williston basin  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wbi holdings 
these services have enhanced montana dakota s and great plains competitive posture with alternate fuels  although certain of montana dakota s and great plains customers have the potential of bypassing the respective distribution systems by directly accessing transmission pipelines located within close proximity 
montana dakota and great plains acquire their system requirements directly from producers  processors and marketers 
such natural gas is supplied by a portfolio of contracts specifying market based pricing  and is transported under transportation agreements by williston basin  northern gas company  south dakota intrastate pipeline company  northern border pipeline company  viking gas transmission company and northern natural gas company to provide firm service to their customers 
montana dakota has also contracted with williston basin to provide firm storage services which enable montana dakota to meet winter peak requirements as well as allow it to better manage its natural gas costs by purchasing natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year 
demand for natural gas  which is a widely traded commodity  is sensitive to changes in market price 
montana dakota and great plains believe that  based on regional supplies of natural gas and the pipeline transmission network currently available through its suppliers and pipeline service providers  supplies are adequate to meet its system natural gas requirements for the next five years 
regulatory matters montana dakota s and great plains retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting monthly adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity  transportation and storage costs 
current regulatory practices allow montana dakota and great plains to recover increases or refund decreases in such costs within a period ranging from months to months from the time such changes occur 
environmental matters montana dakota s and great plains natural gas distribution operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations 
montana dakota and great plains believe they are in substantial compliance with those regulations 
utility services utility services is a diversified infrastructure construction company specializing in electric  natural gas and telecommunication utility construction as well as interior industrial electrical  exterior lighting and traffic signalization 
utility services has engineering  design and build capability and provides related specialty equipment sales and rental services 
these services are provided to electric  natural gas  and telecommunication companies along with municipal  commercial and industrial entities throughout most of the united states 
during  the company acquired utility services companies based in california  colorado  montana and ohio 
none of these acquisitions was individually material to the company 
utility services operates in a highly competitive business environment 
most of utility services work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost plus or fixed price contracts 
the workforce and equipment are highly mobile  providing greater flexibility in the size and location of utility services market area 
competition is primarily based on price and reputation for quality  safety and reliability 
the size and area location of the services provided will be a factor in the number of competitors that utility services will encounter on any particular project 
utility services believes that the diversification of the services it provides will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment 
in the aggregate  electric utilities represent the largest customer base 
accordingly  electric utilities account for a significant portion of the work performed by the utility services segment and the amount of construction contracts from utilities is dependent to a certain extent on the level and timing of maintenance programs undertaken by such utilities 
utility services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long term relationships with these customers 
construction and maintenance crews are active year round 
however  activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather 
pipeline and energy services general williston basin  the principal regulated business of wbi holdings  owns and operates over  miles of transmission  gathering and storage lines and compressor stations located in the states of montana  north dakota  south dakota and wyoming 
through three underground storage fields located in montana and wyoming  storage services are provided to local distribution companies  producers  natural gas marketers and others  and serve to enhance system deliverability 
williston basin s system is strategically located near five natural gas producing basins making natural gas supplies available to williston basin s transportation and storage customers 
at december   williston basin s net plant investment was approximately million 
wbi holdings owns and operates gathering facilities in colorado  kansas  montana  nebraska and wyoming 
these facilities include various field gathering lines and owned and leased compression facilities some of which interconnect with williston basin s system 
an underground natural gas storage facility in kentucky and a one sixth interest in the assets of various offshore gathering pipelines and associated onshore pipeline and related processing facilities are also owned by wbi holdings 
wbi holdings  through its energy services businesses  seeks new energy markets while continuing to expand present markets for natural gas 
its activities include buying and selling natural gas and arranging transportation services to end users  pipelines  municipals and local distribution companies 
the energy services segment transacts a significant portion of its business on the williston basin and texas gas transmission corp 
pipeline systems  serving customers in the rocky mountain  upper midwest  southern and central regions of the united states 
in  a pipeline and cable tracking and locating technology company was acquired 
this company provides products and services which are an integral part of the ongoing reliability of the submerged pipeline and cable infrastructure 
under the natural gas act  as amended  williston basin and certain other operations of wbi holdings are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc regarding certificate  rate and accounting matters 
system demand and competition the natural gas pipeline industry  although regulated  is very competitive 
in the mid s  customers began switching their natural gas service from a bundled merchant service to transportation 
this switching was accelerated with the implementation of order which unbundled pipelines services 
this change reflects most customers willingness to purchase their natural gas supply from producers  processors or marketers rather than pipelines 
williston basin competes with several pipelines for its customers transportation business and at times will have to discount rates in an effort to retain market share 
however  the strategic location of williston basin s system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services provided by williston basin and affiliates along with interconnections with other pipelines serve to enhance williston basin s competitive position 
although a significant portion of williston basin s firm customers  which include montana dakota  have relatively secure residential and commercial end users  virtually all have some price sensitive end users that could switch to alternate fuels 
williston basin transports substantially all of montana dakota s natural gas utilizing firm transportation agreements  which at december   represented percent of williston basin s currently subscribed firm transportation capacity 
in november  montana dakota executed a new firm transportation agreement with williston basin for a term of five years which began in july in addition  in july  montana dakota entered into a twenty year contract with williston basin to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting montana dakota s winter peak requirements 
system supply williston basin s underground storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately  million cubic feet mmcf  including  mmcf and  mmcf of recoverable and nonrecoverable native gas  respectively 
williston basin s storage facilities enable its customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and  thus  facilitate meeting winter peak requirements 
natural gas supplies from traditional regional sources have declined during the past several years and such declines are anticipated to continue 
as a result  williston basin anticipates that a potentially significant amount of the future supply needed to meet its customers demands will come from non traditional  off system sources 
the acquisition of the coal bed natural gas assets in the powder river basin is expected to meet some of these supply needs 
williston basin expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services 
williston basin will continue to look for opportunities to increase transportation and storage services through system expansion or other pipeline interconnections or enhancements which could provide substantial future benefits 
regulatory matters and revenues subject to refund in june  williston basin filed a general rate increase application with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
as a result of ferc orders issued after williston basin s application was filed  williston basin filed revised base rates in december with the ferc 
williston basin began collecting such increase effective january   subject to refund 
in july  the ferc issued an order which addressed various issues including storage cost allocations  return on equity and throughput 
in august  williston basin requested rehearing of such order 
in june  the ferc issued an order approving and denying various issues addressed in williston basin s rehearing request  and also remanding the return on equity issue to an administrative law judge for further proceedings 
in july  williston basin requested rehearing of certain issues which were contained in the june ferc order 
in september  the ferc granted williston basin s request for rehearing with respect to the return on equity issue but also ordered williston basin to issue interim refunds prior to the final determination in this proceeding 
as a result  in october  williston basin issued refunds to its customers totaling million  all from amounts which had previously been reserved 
in december  a hearing was held before the ferc regarding the return on equity issue 
on april   the administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the remanded return on equity issue 
on august   williston basin filed a stipulation and agreement for the purpose of resolving the rate and refund matters at issue with the ferc 
on november   the ferc issued its order accepting the august  stipulation and agreement 
as a result  on december   williston basin issued refunds to its customers totaling million  all from amounts which had previously been reserved 
in december  williston basin filed a general natural gas rate change application with the ferc 
williston basin began collecting such rates effective june   subject to refund 
reserves have been provided for a portion of the revenues that have been collected subject to refund with respect to pending regulatory proceedings and to reflect future resolution of certain issues with the ferc 
based on the november  ferc order referenced above  williston basin  in the fourth quarter of  determined that reserves it had previously established exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves and recognized in income million after tax 
williston basin  in the second quarter of  determined that reserves it had previously established in relation to a general natural gas rate change application and the general rate increase application exceeded its expected refund obligation and  accordingly  reversed reserves and recognized in income million after tax 
williston basin believes that its remaining reserves are adequate based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the application filed in december environmental matters wbi holdings pipeline and energy services operations are generally subject to federal  state and local environmental  facility siting  zoning and planning laws and regulations

the amounts relating to the elimination of intercompany transactions for operating revenues  purchased natural gas sold and operation and maintenance expense are as follows million  million and 
million for  million  million and 
million for  and million  million and 
million for  respectively 
compared to electric electric earnings increased due to higher demand related retail sales to all major customer classes  higher average realized rates and lower employee benefit related expenses 
increased fuel and purchased power costs  largely higher purchased power costs  increased coal costs  and higher natural gas generation related costs  partially offset the earnings increase 
higher maintenance expense at certain of the company s electric generating stations  and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  resulting from higher property  plant and equipment balances  also partially offset the earnings increase 
natural gas distribution earnings improved at the natural gas distribution business largely due to higher weather related retail sales volumes resulting from weather in the fourth quarter which was percent colder than a year ago 
increased service and repair margins  earnings from great plains  which was acquired in july  and higher transportation volumes also added to the earnings increase 
increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  due to higher property  plant and equipment balances  and lower average realized transportation rates  partially offset the earnings increase 
utility services utility services earnings increased as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year  higher work load in the rocky mountain region  primarily related to fiber optic installation projects  and increases from engineering services 
this increase was somewhat offset by decreased construction activity for utilities on the west coast  largely the result of utility merger activity and the california energy crisis 
pipeline and energy services pipeline and energy services earnings decreased primarily due to the absence in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income associated with ferc orders received in the and general rate proceedings  the recognition in of a million after tax reserve adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to the resolution of certain production tax and other state tax matters  and the recognition in income in of million after tax resulting from a favorable order received from the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit court dc circuit court relating to the general rate proceeding 
an asset impairment charge of million after tax in at one of the company s energy services companies also lowered earnings 
in addition  higher bad debt expense and lower natural gas margins from energy services  and higher operation and maintenance expenses at the pipeline  largely higher compressor related expenses and payroll costs  contributed to the decline in earnings 
partially offsetting the decline in earnings was the recognition in of a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and resulting increase to income relating to the resolution of the general rate proceeding 
higher natural gas transportation volumes combined with higher average transportation rates and increased gathering volumes at the pipeline also partially offset the earnings decline 
the increase in energy services revenue and the related increase in purchased natural gas sold resulted from significantly higher natural gas prices and increased volumes 
natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings increased primarily due to significantly higher realized natural gas and oil prices 
higher natural gas and oil production due to acquisitions since the comparable period last year and ongoing development of existing properties  along with increased other revenue due to higher sales of inventoried natural gas  added to the earnings increase 
partially offsetting the earnings improvement were increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  due to higher production volumes and higher rates  and increased operation and maintenance expense  mainly from higher lease operating expenses and higher general and administrative costs due primarily to acquisitions  and increased maintenance on existing properties 
increased interest expense due to higher average borrowings and interest rates also partially offset the earnings increase 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized prices that were percent and percent  respectively  of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining construction materials and mining earnings increased largely due to the absence in of million in after tax charges to earnings in  the result of the resolution of the coal arbitration proceeding 
higher earnings at the construction materials operations as a result of earnings from businesses acquired since the comparable period last year  higher aggregate  ready mixed concrete and cement volumes at existing operations and a gain of million after tax on the sale of a nonstrategic property also added to the earnings improvement 
increased interest expense resulting from higher acquisition related borrowings  higher selling  general and administrative costs  higher energy costs and increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due to increased aggregate volumes and increased plant balances  partially offset the earnings improvement at the construction materials operations 
compared to electric electric earnings improved primarily due to increased sales for resale revenue caused by a percent increase in volumes at higher margins  both largely resulting from favorable contracts 
lower retail fuel and purchased power costs primarily due to decreased purchased power demand charges resulting from the pass through of periodic maintenance costs  related to a participation power contract  also added to the earnings increase 
increased operation and maintenance expense resulting mainly from higher subcontractor costs  primarily at the lewis clark station due to boiler and turbine maintenance  and increased payroll expense partially offset the earnings improvement 
natural gas distribution earnings decreased at the natural gas distribution business due primarily to lower sales volumes caused by weather that was percent and percent warmer than last year and normal  respectively 
increased operation and maintenance expense resulting from higher payroll expenses also added to the reduction in earnings 
increased volumes transported  primarily to industrial customers  and higher service and repair income partially offset the earnings decline 
utility services utility services earnings increased primarily due to businesses acquired since the comparable period last year and higher earnings from existing operations due to increased construction work load and higher margins 
pipeline and energy services pipeline and energy services earnings increased largely due to a million after tax reserve revenue adjustment and a million after tax reserve adjustment  both as previously discussed 
the recognition of million after tax resulting from a favorable order received from the dc circuit court  as previously discussed  also contributed to the increase in earnings 
decreased transportation to storage and off system markets at lower average transportation rates and reduced sales of inventoried natural gas somewhat offset the earnings increase 
the million after tax reversal of reserves in for certain contingencies relating to a ferc order concerning a compliance filing also partially offset the earnings increase 
the increase in energy services revenue and the related increase in purchased natural gas sold resulted primarily from the acquisition of a natural gas marketing business in july natural gas and oil production natural gas and oil production earnings increased largely as a result of the million million after tax noncash write downs of natural gas and oil properties  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
higher natural gas and oil prices and increased natural gas production due to both new acquisitions and the ongoing development of existing properties also increased earnings 
in addition  decreased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense due largely to lower rates resulting from the write downs of natural gas and oil properties also added to the earnings improvement 
decreased oil production  resulting mainly from normal production declines and the sale of nonstrategic properties  and higher operation and maintenance expense partially offset the increase in earnings 
higher operation and maintenance expense resulted from changes in production mix and higher general and administrative expenses 
hedging activities for natural gas and oil production for resulted in realized natural gas prices which were unchanged and realized oil prices that were percent of what otherwise would have been received 
construction materials and mining construction materials and mining earnings decreased primarily due to lower earnings at the coal operations largely resulting from million in after tax charges and lower average coal prices  both relating to the coal contract arbitration proceeding 
earnings at the construction materials businesses increased due to businesses acquired since the comparable period last year and increased activity at existing construction materials operations 
higher asphalt volumes  increased average ready mixed concrete prices and increased construction and sales of other product lines all contributed to the earnings increase at the construction materials operations 
higher selling  general and administrative costs and increased interest expense resulting from increased acquisition related long term debt somewhat offset the increased earnings at the construction materials business 
normal seasonal losses realized in the first quarter of by construction materials businesses not owned during the full first quarter in also partially offset the earnings improvement at the construction materials business

capital expenditures for the years through  include those for system upgrades  routine replacements  service extensions  routine equipment maintenance and replacements  pipeline and gathering expansion projects  the building of construction materials handling and transportation facilities  the further enhancement of natural gas and oil production and reserve growth  and for potential future acquisitions 
the company continues to evaluate potential future acquisitions  however  these acquisitions are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  actual acquisitions and capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates in the preceding table 
it is anticipated that all of the funds required for capital expenditures and retirements of long term debt and preferred stock for the years through will be met from various sources 
these sources include internally generated funds  the company s million revolving credit and term loan agreement  an existing line of credit of million  a commercial paper credit facility at centennial  as described below  and through the issuance of long term debt and the company s equity securities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including price swap and collar agreements  to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and oil 
the company s policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculating to take advantage of market trends and conditions and the company has procedures in place to monitor compliance with its policies 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in relation to financial instruments in the event of nonperformance by counterparties  but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their existing credit ratings 
the swap and collar agreements call for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to counterparties based upon the difference between a fixed and a variable price as specified by the agreements 
the variable price is either a quoted natural gas price on the nymex  colorado interstate gas index or other various indexes or an oil price quoted on the nymex 
the company believes that there is a high degree of correlation because the timing of purchases and production and the swap and collar agreements are closely matched  and hedge prices are established in the areas of operations 
for the years ending december   and  gains or losses on the swap and collar agreements were matched and reported in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income as a component of the related commodity transaction at the time of settlement with the counterparty 
the following table summarizes hedge agreements entered into by certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  as of december  these agreements call for the subsidiaries to receive fixed prices and pay variable prices

the favorable or unfavorable position is not recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december  and favorable and unfavorable positions related to commodity hedge agreements are expected to be generally offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the value of the underlying commodity transactions 
in the event a derivative financial instrument does not qualify for hedge accounting or when the underlying commodity transaction matures  is sold  is extinguished  or is terminated  the current favorable or unfavorable position on the open contract would be included in results of operations 
the company s policy requires approval to terminate a hedge agreement prior to its original maturity 
in the event a hedge agreement is terminated  the realized gain or loss at the time of termination would be deferred until the underlying commodity transaction is sold or matures and is expected to generally offset the corresponding increases or decreases in the value of the underlying commodity transaction 
the company has energy marketing operations that are exposed to risks  including risks relating to changes in natural gas prices and counterparty performance credit risk  associated with natural gas forward purchase and sale commitments 
these commitments involve the purchase and sale of natural gas and related delivery of such commodity 
the energy marketing operations seek to match natural gas purchases and sales on specific contracts so that a margin is obtained on the transportation of such commodity as distinguished from earning a margin on changes in market prices 
in addition  the energy marketing contracts are generally entered into on a seasonal basis with contracts of a duration generally not exceeding months 
contracts related to these activities are valued at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded as assets or liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the net change in fair value representing unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in market prices on these contracts is reflected in earnings on the company s consolidated statements of income 
net unrealized gains and losses on these contracts were not material in  or in general  market risk is the risk of fluctuations in the market price of the commodity being marketed and is influenced primarily by supply and demand 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk through a variety of risk management techniques 
such procedures include monitoring commitments and positions  evaluating sensitivity to changes in market prices and market volatility  and reporting to senior management 
credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
the company maintains credit procedures  which management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk 
the company seeks to mitigate credit risk by applying specific eligibility criteria to prospective counterparties and may require letters of credit or similar security to secure payment on such sales contracts 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties may occur 
to date  no such defaults have had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
interest rate risk the company uses fixed and variable rate long term debt to partially finance capital expenditures and mandatory debt retirements 
these debt agreements expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by taking advantage of market conditions when timing the placement of long term or permanent financing 
the company also has outstanding  shares of series preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption as of december  the company is obligated to make annual sinking fund contributions to retire the preferred stock and pay cumulative preferred dividends at a fixed rate of
