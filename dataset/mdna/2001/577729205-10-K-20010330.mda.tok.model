company background we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in in the mid s  we were a leading technology innovator in the hard disk drive industry 
as is true today  the hard disk drive industry during the s was intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product and technology obsolescence  changing customer requirements  dramatic shifts in market share and significant erosion of average selling prices 
in an effort to mitigate the risks associated with these factors  we pursued all major product segments in the hard disk drive market  utilizing multiple product families and technology platforms 
this costly strategy added significant complexity to the business  which caused us to delay or miss a number of key product introductions and ultimately led to the deterioration of our overall financial condition 
as a result of this deterioration  we sold of our outstanding common stock to hyundai electronics industries and its affiliates in in early  hyundai electronics america hea acquired all of the remaining publicly held shares of our common stock as well as all of our common stock then held by hyundai electronics industries and its affiliates 
shortly thereafter  hea invested in renewed efforts to revitalize maxtor 
in july  we hired michael r 
cannon  our current chief executive officer and president and a year veteran of the hard drive industry  who had previously served in senior management positions in the systems storage division at ibm  syquest technology and control data corporation  to lead a turnaround of the company and capture business at leading desktop computer manufacturers 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  receiving net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
as a result of this offering  our company ceased to be a majority owned subsidiary of hea 
in february  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock with net proceeds to us of approximately million

according to international data corporation idc  the desktop computer segment is the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market  accounting for approximately of global personal computer shipments in the demand for desktop computers and  therefore  computer hard disk drives  is driven by continued improvements in desktop computing price to performance ratios  the rapid accumulation of data resulting from the digitization of information previously stored in paper form  larger file sizes created by multimedia intensive applications  and the exchange of increasing volumes of data among users across the internet and intranets with the proliferation of collaborative computing 
future demand growth for hard disk drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard disk drive markets 
hard disk drive technology 
the basic operation of a hard disk drive has not changed materially since its introduction in the s 
to improve the performance of hard disk drives  hard disk drive manufacturers have concentrated their efforts on optimizing the performance of the various components of the hard disk drive 
the main components of the hard disk drive are the hard disk assembly and the printed circuit board 
the head disk assembly includes the head  media disks  head positioning mechanism actuator and spin motor 
these components are contained in a hard base plate protective package in a contamination free environment 
the printed circuit board includes custom integrated circuits  an interface connector to the host computer and a power connector 
the head disk assembly is comprised of one or more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the disks by a spin motor 
disks are made of a smooth substrate to which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied 
each disk has a head suspended directly above it  which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk 
the sensor element of the head  also known as the slider  is getting progressively smaller  resulting in reduced material costs 
the integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically include a drive interface and a controller 
the drive interface receives instructions from the computer  while the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks  and controls the heads 
the location of data on each disk is logically maintained in tracks  divided into sectors 
the computer sends instructions to read data or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations 
industry standard interfaces are utilized to allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer 
a key performance metric in the hard disk drive industry is areal density  which is the measure of stored bits per square inch on the recording surface of a disk 
an increase in areal density allows a hard disk drive provider to decrease the price per megabyte stored by increasing overall storage capacity per disk  thus reducing product costs through reduced component requirements 
during and  certain hard disk drive providers began transitioning to magneto resistive heads 
prior to this transition  most hard disk drives utilized thin film inductive recording heads 
magneto resistive heads have discrete read and write structures which provide more signal than the older thin film inductive heads 
this results in significantly higher areal densities  which increases storage capacity per disk and improves manufacturing margin and product reliability 
hard disk drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of technological innovations designed to further increase hard disk drive performance and reduce product costs  including attempting to simplify the electronic architecture by combining the traditional servo control functions of the digital signal processor based electronic architecture and the error recovery and interface management functions of traditional hard drive microprocessors on a single integrated circuit 
moreover  to consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume production of new products  some hard disk drive providers are striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize common firmware and mechanical designs and re use of manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated circuits across various product generations and product lines 
hard disk drive market challenges 
personal computer manufacturers compete in a consolidating market 
the top ten personal computer manufacturers accounted for greater than of all personal computer units shipped during and these personal computer manufacturers use the quality  storage capacity and performance characteristics of hard drives to select their hard disk drive providers 
personal computer manufacturers typically seek to qualify three or four providers for a given hard disk drive product generation 
to qualify consistently with personal computer manufacturers and thus succeed in the desktop hard drive industry  a hard disk drive provider must consistently execute on its product development and manufacturing process in order to be among the first to market introduction and first to volume production at leading storage capacity per disk with competitive prices 
failure to reach the market on time or to deliver timely volume production usually results in significantly decreased gross margins due to rapidly declining average selling prices and dramatic losses in market share 
successful achievement on the performance parameters  however  is only part of the competitive equation 
as personal computer manufacturers seek to develop successful business models  they are also requiring their hard disk drive vendors to maintain high levels of quality to enable low cost of ownership and adapt their inventory management models to be compatible with the emerging build to order business model in the personal computer industry 
our solution we have established ourselves as a leading provider of high quality  high performance hard disk drives to major desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
our management team has extensive hard disk drive industry experience across all functional areas 
as a result  we have been able to define and implement the key business processes necessary to fulfill the needs of our customers 
these processes focus on the efficient  timely and cost effective integration of leading edge technology to create highly manufacturable hard disk drives 
moreover  our senior management team vigorously monitors these processes in an effort to ensure consistent execution and prompt response to customer demands 
we intend to continue our leadership position in the desktop hard disk drive industry by consistently executing these fundamental business processes 
we have leveraged our strength in hard drives to provide reliable  easy to install  cost effective network attached storage devices to meet the growing storage needs of business networks and data centers 
we intend to expand our presence in the network attached storage industry by adding functionality and features to our core product line 
our strategy we seek to be the dominant provider of hard disk drives to leading desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
our strategy to achieve this goal includes the following elements effectively integrate new technology 
we augment our traditional product development teams with an advanced technology group 
the advanced technology group s purpose is to monitor and evaluate advancements in hard disk drive technology for possible integration into our future products 
this group also works closely with our product development teams and strategic component vendors to obtain early access to the latest hard disk drive component technology  allow for flexibility in choosing state of the art components  and ensure viability of new product technologies and components prior to product design 
through this process  we intend to continue to integrate new technologies into our existing core technology platform and to strengthen our ability to introduce high quality  highly manufacturable  high performance hard disk drive products with industry leading time to volume production on a consistent basis 
leverage design excellence 
our product development methodology reduces risks associated with design changes by focusing on common firmware and mechanical designs  and re use of manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated circuits 
through this process  we have created a technology platform  which is used as the common core of each of our current hard disk drive products and which we believe is extendible into products for new and emerging hard disk drive market opportunities 
to reduce the overall cost of ownership of our hard disk drive products  we use a robust mechanical architecture designed to reduce defects that result from customer mishandling during installation 
we also work closely with leading component suppliers in an effort to ensure that adequate tolerances are designed into our products to achieve high manufacturing yields and product quality 
by utilizing this product development methodology  we have successfully introduced and achieved timely volume production of magneto resistive head hard disk drives 
capitalize on flexible manufacturing 
our singapore manufacturing facility utilizes a flexible cell based process that enables us to dedicate manufacturing cells to particular customers  thereby allowing us to identify  isolate and remedy manufacturing defects quickly  resulting in improved product quality  faster time to volume production and improved overall customer satisfaction  simultaneously manufacture multiple product configurations  quickly reconfigure the facility to respond to customer change requests and changes in product and customer mix  effectively adapt our inventory management model to the emerging build to order business model employed by certain of our desktop computer manufacturer customers  and add incremental capacity as needed at a relatively low cost 
this flexible cell based process  when coupled with our product design methodology  has enabled us to significantly improve time to volume production 
maintain strong market share with leading desktop computer manufacturers 
we intend to continue to achieve leading time to volume production of high quality  high performance hard disk drives and maintain our focus on excellent customer service to continue to support and maintain our strong market share position with leading personal computer manufacturers 
our quarterly market share of the desktop hard disk drive market in terms of units shipped increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of according to idc 
shipments to dell  fujitsu  compaq and ibm accounted for of our total revenue in the quarter ended june  and increased to in the quarter ended december  expand relationships with distributors and retailers 
we intend to strengthen our distribution and retail businesses to capture the higher margin opportunities offered in these markets 
we will continue to build the infrastructure necessary to better target these markets  including additional staff and marketing support 
we will continue to invest in promotional programs to generate interest and sales in the distribution and retail channels 
capture emerging opportunities for hard drives in consumer electronics applications 
we believe that the demand for hard drives in consumer electronics applications will grow significantly 
today hard drive storage in consumer electronics applications has been primarily incorporated into personal video recorders pvrs and set top boxes 
maxtor has announced agreements with webtv and replaytv to provide hard disk drives for pvrs 
we intend to pursue consumer electronics opportunities by developing hard drive products appropriate for these applications and establishing the necessary infrastructure and expertise to sell to these markets 
maintain customer satisfaction 
we believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors by focusing on ease of doing business and overall customer satisfaction 
for example  our no quibble service program has been well received by our customers 
we also have begun to place significant attention on total supply chain management to align our business model with the evolving build to order manufacturing business model of certain desktop computer manufacturers 
we use our flexible  cell based manufacturing process coupled with a just in time inventory model to rapidly respond to the changing needs of our key desktop computer manufacturer customers 
to further automate and improve the efficiency of our total supply chain management  we have installed new enterprise resource planning and related software 
broaden product portfolio 
to capture higher margin opportunities  we intend to leverage our existing technology platform and product development methodology to develop hard disk drive products to meet the needs of desktop computers  storage subsystems  consumer electronics  and other emerging storage applications 
to this end  we currently offer products with two rotational speeds and rpm with configurations from through disks 
this results in a portfolio with one of the broadest ranges of performance and capacity in the industry and allows us to target entry  mid range and high end applications in all of the above markets 
the and platter designs have been particularly beneficial to our profit margins and our strategic position  as few of our competitors offer these high capacity products 
additionally  in we announced the maxattach nas line of server appliances with enhanced software features that include disk mirroring and disk spanning at storage capacities ranging from to gigabytes 
these products are designed to enable quick  easy  safe and cost effective addition of storage to business networks 
our maxattach nas line of rack mounted server appliances broadens client support to include unix linux in addition to windows 
the maxattach is available in and gigabyte configurations  allowing us to address the storage needs of larger workgroups  internet service providers and departmental market segments 
in october  we announced our new external storage solution  the maxtor external storage product  which adds external storage to enabled pcs and macintosh computers 
product development technology one of the most important changes undertaken as part of our turnaround was the restructuring of our product development process to separate the enabling technology development phase from the product design phase 
in early  we suffered from poor product quality and performance and products that were late to market 
this contrasts sharply with today as we now enjoy strong customer relationships based on excellent product quality  time to volume production leadership and industry leading performance 
enabling technology development phase 
the advanced technology group is responsible for the enabling technology development phase  including working closely with our product design teams and strategic component suppliers to create a variety of state of the art technologies to be used in our future products  developing early prototypes to ascertain the stability and manufacturability of our planned products  and analyzing the latest head  disk  channel  motor and application specific integrated circuit technologies and designs to broaden and strengthen our technology platform 
this group also focuses on leveraging our current proven technology platform by re using as much electronic and mechanical technology as possible in each successive product generation 
in an effort to deliver the highest product quality possible  the advanced technology group begins its review of emerging technologies as early as possible  normally months before such technologies might be included in our products 
product design phase 
the creation of the advanced technology group as part of our turnaround freed our existing product design group from the responsibility of assessing the viability of new and emerging technologies and allowed it to concentrate on improving product performance  robustness  manufacturability  quality and materials costs 
the product design group also is responsible  in part  for executing our new product introduction process 
this process is a highly disciplined review procedure designed to ensure that new product designs meet clearly specified criteria in terms of yield  scrap  quality  productivity and production ramp rates prior to release into volume production 
products we currently provide hard disk drives exclusively for the desktop computer market 
our diamondmax product family consists of inch hard disk drives with storage capacities ranging from gigabytes to gigabytes

our hard disk drive manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly of high level subassemblies built to our specifications and testing of completed products 
manufacturing 
pilot production of our products  as well as cost reduction  quality and product improvement engineering on current products  are conducted at our longmont  colorado facility 
we manufacture our hard disk drives in volume at multiple facilities in singapore  which uses a flexible  cell based process 
the singapore facility consists of modular production units mpus  each of which contains a number of modular work cells mwcs 
each mwc essentially is a mini serial production line consisting of all of the tooling and test equipment necessary to build and test a hard disk drive 
each mpu is responsible for managing the supply of the components and other parts required by its mwcs 
we coupled our cell based manufacturing approach with a sophisticated factory information system that collects data from each mwc on various productivity and quality metrics 
in march  we purchased two buildings in singapore totaling approximately  square meters and entered into a long term lease of the underlying land from singapore s housing development board 
the property is located near our current volume manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to a sublease accompanying the option  we have taken possession of this facility and have begun volume manufacturing and warehousing operations there 
quality 
consistent with our goal to establish maxtor as a leader in product quality and overall customer satisfaction  we have implemented a corporate wide quality program  which focuses on robustness of design and improved design tolerances  quality of incoming parts and factory process control  and customer feedback  failure analysis and timely response 
in addition  our quality  materials  enabling technology and product development groups work closely with leading component vendors in an effort to ensure sufficient tolerances are designed into our hard disk drives to achieve high manufacturing yields and product quality 
our singapore facility also is iso certified 
finally  our executives meet regularly with customers to exchange product quality information to facilitate rapid analysis of customer failures and timely implementation of corrective actions 
materials and supplies we have developed and continue to develop strategic relationships with leading suppliers of many of the key components for our hard disk drive products 
these relationships enable us to actively manage our supply chain to improve flexibility in choosing state of the art components and to reduce component  inventory and overall product costs 
in addition  our strategic suppliers work closely with our advanced technology group  enabling us to gain early access to leading edge hard disk drive technology and to improve the overall efficiency of our product design process 
we rely on a limited number of leading suppliers for the parts used in the manufacturing of our products  including magneto resistive heads and head stack assemblies  media  custom integrated circuits  read channel integrated circuits  printed circuit boards and motor baseplate assemblies 
in general  we seek to have at least two or three suppliers for each of our component requirements 
custom application specific integrated circuits  including our digital signal processor controller chips  and channels  however  currently are sole sourced from texas instruments and lucent  respectively 
because of their custom nature  these products require significant design in periods and long lead times 
we outsource a majority of our printed circuit board assembly to celestica  inc  a successor to our former affiliate  international manufacturing services  inc customers and sales channels from to  chronic performance and quality issues  as well as being late to the market  had impacted adversely our ability to win business with leading desktop computer manufacturers 
as a result  we were heavily dependent on sales to a large number of regional distributors which limited our ability to forecast periodic shipments and shifted our product mix toward lower performance  lower margin products 
recogniz ing that the majority of the growth in shipments in the desktop computer market was being captured by a limited number of desktop computer manufacturers  we simplified our sales channels and focused our sales and marketing efforts on becoming a significant provider of hard disk drives to leading desktop computer manufacturers  including dell  fujitsu  compaq  and ibm  and leading distributors and retailers  including xander international  bell micro  ingram and compusa 
by emphasizing overall customer satisfaction  product quality and performance and time to volume production  we believe that we have established a strong customer base 
manufacturers 
shipments to dell  fujitsu  compaq  and ibm  our largest desktop computer manufacturer customers  accounted for of our total revenue in the quarter ended june  and increased to in the quarter ended december  during the year ended december   two customers  dell and ibm  accounted for and of our revenue 
during the years ended january  and december   dell accounted for and of our revenue 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to maintain and further develop strong desktop computer manufacturer customer relationships and to provide products that fit the needs of the desktop computer manufacturer channel 
distributors 
we use a select group of distributors to sell our products cost effectively to the large number of geographically dispersed customers which tend to hold very small market shares of the overall desktop computer market  including value added resellers  dealers  system integrators and small desktop computer manufacturers 
distributors accounted for of revenue for the year ended december   of revenue for the year ended january   and of revenue for the year ended december  distributors generally enter into non exclusive agreements with us for purchase and redistribution of product on a quick turnover basis 
purchase orders are placed and revised on a weekly basis 
we grant certain of our distributors price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis 
our major distributors include bell micro  xander international and ingram 
retailers 
to increase awareness of the maxtor brand name and benefit from the typically higher gross margins of the retail sales channel  we sell our retail packaged products directly to major retailers such as computer superstores  warehouse clubs and computer electronics stores  and authorized sales through distributors to smaller retailers 
retailers accounted for of revenue for the year ended december   of revenue for the year ended january   and for the year ended december  our current retail customer base is in the united states and canada  however  we have begun efforts to establish a retail channel presence in the emerging retail markets in europe and asia 
we believe the retail channel complements other sales channels 
retailers supply the after market upgrade sector in which end users purchase and install products to upgrade their computers 
we grant certain of our retailers price protection and limited rights to return product on a rotation basis 
sales and marketing we market and sell our products to leading desktop computer manufacturers  distributors and retailers 
representative offices are located throughout the us and in australia  france  germany  great britain  hong kong  japan  korea  singapore and taiwan 
we have formed multi disciplined  dedicated account and channel teams focused on each of its current and target strategic desktop computer manufacturer  distributor and retail accounts 
these teams generally are comprised of representatives from our sales  marketing  engineering and quality organizations 
our senior management also takes an active role in our sales efforts 
dedicated field sales and technical support personnel are located in close proximity to the manufacturing facilities of each of our desktop computer manufacturer customers 
our marketing and public relations functions are performed both internally and through outside firms 
public relations  direct marketing  worldwide packaging and marketing materials are targeted to various end user segments 
we utilize both consumer media and trade publications 
we have programs under which qualifying resellers are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures 
we also have invested in direct marketing and customer satisfaction programs 
we maintain ongoing contact with end users through primary and secondary market research  focus groups  product registrations and technical support databases 
backlog we generally sell standard products according to standard agreements or purchase order terms 
delivery dates are specified by purchase orders 
such orders may be subject to change  cancellation or rescheduling by the customer without significant penalties 
the quantity actually purchased and shipment schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
in addition  orders for our products are filled for several large customers from just in time inventory warehouses  whereby orders are not placed ahead of time on our order entry backlog system 
instead  we receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer 
upon shipment from the just in time warehouse  the customer is invoiced 
in light of these factors  backlog reporting as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual revenue for any succeeding period and  therefore  is not necessarily an accurate predictor of our future revenue 
competition we compete primarily with manufacturers of inch hard disk drives  including fujitsu  quantum  samsung  seagate  ibm and western digital  some of which have a larger share of the desktop hard disk drive market than ours 
we believe that important competitive factors in the hard disk drive market are quality  storage capacity  performance  price  time to market introduction  time to volume production  desktop computer manufacturer product qualifications  breadth of product lines  reliability and technical service and support 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors

hea is currently an unconditional guarantor of our facilities lease in milpitas  california 
we also maintain  square feet of engineering and pilot production facilities as well as administrative  marketing and materials facilities in longmont  colorado

our leases for our longmont  colorado facility begin to expire on december we have entered into a lease for a new facility in longmont  colorado of  square feet  to be completed in april the new lease has a year term and is renewable for five years 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional space that can accommodate our needs 
our volume manufacturing facilities are located in buildings in singapore totaling approximately  square feet  which are located on two parcels of leased land with leases terminating in with an option to renew for years and with an option to renew for years 
we also lease various sales and support facilities in australia  france  germany  hong kong  ireland  japan  korea  singapore  taiwan  united kingdom  and the united states

item legal proceedings we were previously involved in a dispute with stormedia incorporated  which arose out of an agreement among maxtor  stormedia and hyundai electronics industries 
on february   the bankruptcy court for the northern district of california  san jose division  entered an order implementing and approving as fair and reasonable the terms of a settlement agreement  pursuant to which hyundai and maxtor have paid to stormedia an aggregate of million in settlement of the parties dispute 
this settlement amount is accrued in maxtor s fiscal year financial statements 
the settlement is now final and all cases relating to this matter have been dismissed 
we also have also been in litigation with magnetic media development  llc  or mmd  in the united states district court for the central district of california  over assertions that we infringed certain patents owned by mmd 
the patents relate to magnetic media that we purchase from third party media vendors for use in our hard disk drives 
we made a settlement payment on march  to mmd and obtained a release from mmd of all claims asserted or that could have been asserted against us 
additionally  we have obtained a paid up license for any future activities that may come within the scope of the mmd patents 
the pending lawsuit is in the process of being dismissed by the court with prejudice 
on march   we were sued by papst licensing  gmbh  a german corporation  for infringement of patents that relate to hard disk drives 
papst has asserted that maxtor infringes patents 
the lawsuit had been pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california  but was transferred with other litigation involving papst patents to the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for consolidated or coordinated proceedings 
papst s infringement allegations are based on spindle motors that maxtor purchases from third party motor vendors  and the use of such spindle motors in hard disk drives 
maxtor purchased the overwhelming majority of the spindle motors used in its hard disk drives from vendors that were licensed under papst s patents 
while we believe that we have valid defenses to papst s claims  the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain and other infringement claims relating to current patents  pending patent applications  and or future patent applications or issued patents could be asserted by papst 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully defend ourself against this or any other papst lawsuit 
the papst complaint asserts claims to an unspecified dollar amount of damages 
a favorable outcome for papst in this lawsuit could result in the issuance of an injunction against us and our products and or the payment of monetary damages equal to a reasonable royalty 
in the case of a finding of a willful infringement  we also could be required to pay treble damages and papst s attorney s fees 
accordingly  a litigation outcome favorable to papst could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results
