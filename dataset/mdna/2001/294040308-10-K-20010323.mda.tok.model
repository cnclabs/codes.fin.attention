item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report 
certain statements made herein are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of such statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
in particular  unanticipated changes in the economic  competitive  governmental  technological  marketing and other factors identified herein and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission could affect such results 
general the company has received most of its revenue from commercial remediation services and systems  which includes  primarily  revenue attributable to traditional remediation services such as soil vapor extraction and air sparging 
in addition  a portion of the company s revenue to date has been derived from research funded largely by corporate and governmental sponsors to develop cost effective advanced biological treatment systems 
revenues from these advanced treatment technologies are still in the early stages of commercial development  and additional expenditures by the company will be required for continued research and development and expanded marketing activities 
the amount and timing of such expenditures cannot be predicted and will vary depending on several factors  including the progress of development and testing  funding from third parties  the level of enforcement of environmental regulations by federal and state agencies  technological advances  changing competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial potential of the company s systems 
on april   the company acquired fluid management  inc fmi  a full service environmental consulting and engineering firm that is now operated as the company s wisconsin and illinois divisions 
remediation services and installation of traditional remediation systems are the divisions core business and generate the greatest portion of the divisions revenues 
pursuant to the wisconsin petroleum environmental cleanup fund act pecfa  a program funded by the state of wisconsin for cleaning up underground storage tanks  the wisconsin division s clients or their lending banks are entitled to seek reimbursement for a majority of the remediation costs paid to the wisconsin division 
the wisconsin department of commerce dcom reviews claims for reimbursement under pecfa to determine the extent to which submitted claims will be reimbursed 
the dcom review process may not be completed until one to three years after the expense has been incurred and paid by the wisconsin division s client or its bank 
this exposes the client to the risk that remediation expenses it incurred and paid ultimately may be disallowed for pecfa reimbursement by dcom 
the wisconsin division has in a number of cases reimbursed its clients or their lending banks for the remediation costs for services provided by the wisconsin division which ultimately were determined by dcom to be ineligible for reimbursement under pecfa 
since the company acquired fmi  the company has reimbursed its clients and their lending banks an aggregate of  including  in the year ended december  at december   the company had  in reserves with respect to potential ineligible claims related to approximately million in claims that had not yet been fully reviewed by dcom 
there can be no assurance that the amount of such reserve  which was determined by management based on historic reimbursement disallowance rates under the pecfa program  will be adequate 
on april   the state of wisconsin adopted emergency rules emergency rules with regard to pecfa which effectively reduced the expected revenue per site that the wisconsin division can capture under the program for the foreseeable future 
the state of wisconsin s stated intent for issuance of the emergency rules was to reduce the amount of funds being paid for cleanup efforts under the pecfa program 
until the issuance of the emergency rules  the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr determined the appropriate remedial activity for each site under the program in every instance 
per the emergency rules  dnr s authority extends only to sites where groundwater contamination is evident 
where contamination of soil exists without groundwater contamination  dcom administers the remedial program with no dnr involvement 
under the emergency rules  lower cost natural attenuation is mandated unless certain conditions exist which would indicate that active remediation is necessary 
this is a significant change  because natural attenuation was previously not an approved option and virtually all sites were actively remediated 
based upon the company s experience  it is estimated that the active remediation approach under pecfa resulted in revenues ranging from  to  per site 
since the adoption of the emergency rules  the company s revenues from a typical site have been reduced to approximately  to  this regulatory event has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a dramatic decrease in revenue  net income and cash flow from the wisconsin division 
as a result of this event  the company reviewed the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with its acquisition of fmi and recorded a non cash charge of  in the second quarter of representing the impairment of the goodwill 
this charge is based on the amount by which the book value exceeded the current estimated fair market value of the goodwill 
the current estimated fair market value was determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows of the wisconsin division discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
the impairment charge fully eliminated the remaining carrying value of the goodwill associated with the fmi acquisition 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   the company s total revenues decreased to  from  in the net loss increased to  from  in  while the basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to in commercial revenues net of reserves for ineligible pecfa claims decreased in to  from  in the decreased commercial revenues are due primarily to reduced revenue in the wisconsin division under the pecfa program related to the adoption of the emergency rules in april revenues from corporate research and development contracts decreased in by to  from  in revenues decreased primarily due to the timing of work associated with phase ii government projects and to the fewer number of projects as compared to total costs and expenses decreased to  in from  in the cost of commercial operations decreased to  during from  in due primarily to decreased revenue levels and slightly improved project margins

as discussed above  in the company recorded a charge of  for impairment of goodwill due to significant changes in the pecfa program that occurred in april and that have negatively impacted the performance of the wisconsin division 
interest income decreased to  in from  in  due primarily to the decreased average cash available for investment 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through revenues from commercial services  sales of biodegradation systems  public offerings and private placements of equity securities  research and development agreements with major industrial companies and research grants from government agencies 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  cash and cash equivalents decreased  from december  to december  due primarily to cash used in operations of  and capital expenditures of  from december  to december   accounts receivable decreased by  primarily as a result of reduced revenues and improved collections

at december   the company had  in reserve for claim adjustments and warranties   of which is available for potential pecfa claim adjustments related to approximately million in unsettled pecfa submittals and  of which is available for potential systems warranty claims and other contract issues 
it is anticipated that the company s currently available cash  cash equivalents and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient operating capital for at least the next to months 
the company may seek additional funds through equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
other matters as of december   the company had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income  if any  through the timing and manner in which these losses may be utilized are limited under section of the internal revenue code of to approximately  per year based on preliminary calculations of certain ownership changes to date and may be further limited in the event of additional ownership changes
