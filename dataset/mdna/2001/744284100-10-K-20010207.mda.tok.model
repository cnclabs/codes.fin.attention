the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto 
overview since  we have focused on supplying spread spectrum rf transceiver modules and wireless lan adapters to oem customers for integration into mobile computing platforms  pen based portables and handheld data collection terminals 
in  we introduced our first commercial product for oem customers  a mhz direct sequence spread spectrum rf transceiver 
we introduced proxlink  our first branded wireless data communications product for the commercial end user market in  and rangelan  a family of mhz direct sequence wireless lan adapters in in  we began commercial shipment of rangelan  the industry s first fcc certified family of ghz frequency hopping spread spectrum wireless lan products 
in  we introduced an integrated single piece pc card adapter and a compact access point product 
in  we introduced our rangelan micro design in module  token ring access point and extension point 
in  we introduced our rangelan frequency hopping product family based on the ieee standard  rangelan ethernet and serial external adapters and the symphony product family  a low cost cordless networking solution for home and small office environments 
in december  we introduced a ghz ultra broadband mbps product family as a result of our acquisition of wavespan 
in april  we introduced our symphony homerf product family of cordless networking products designed to address the requirements of the emerging home and small office networking markets  providing both data networking and voice communications on a shared frequency  based on the homerf protocol 
in june  we introduced plug and play networking solutions for macintoshes and pcs as a result of our acquisition of farallon 
in october  we introduced harmony  a wirefree networking solution designed to operate with current and future wireless lan standards  including openair  ieee b  bluetooth  and future wideband frequency hopping and ghz technologies  in a single  homogeneous architecture 
in october  we also introduced our rangelan ds family of ieee b compliant wireless lan products 
in november  we introduced stratum mp  a ghz unlicensed direct sequence spread spectrum wirefree bridge that provides mbps half duplex throughput in point to point or point to multipoint cellular architectures 
since the introduction of the rangelan product family in  our ghz product sales have increased to  more than of total revenue in we anticipate that our ghz product families will continue to represent a substantial majority of our total revenue as a result of the worldwide availability of unlicensed ghz spectrum as well as the higher throughput and capacity achievable with ghz wireless networks 
to date  we have realized lower gross margins from sales of our ghz products compared to our mhz products due primarily to the higher component costs  higher manufacturing costs associated with early production of various ghz products and declining average selling prices on ghz products 
while we expect manufacturing costs to decline over time as a result of greater efficiencies associated with higher volume production  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve higher gross margins with respect to ghz product sales 
gross margins will be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  the degree to which our manufacturing is outsourced  the location of manufacturing  potential manufacturing licenses of our products  product mix  competitive pricing pressures  the degree of customization of individual products required by oem customers and component and assembly costs 
we have obtained regulatory certifications and authorizations for our ghz rangelan products in over countries 
these certifications and authorizations have significantly increased the available markets for these products 
revenue from sales directly to international customers were   and in   and  respectively 
see business sales and marketing 
a substantial portion of our revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of customers  most of which are oem customers 
we expect that sales to a limited number of oem customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we also have experienced quarter to quarter variability in sales to each of our major oem customers and expect this pattern to continue in the future 
the loss of  or significant reductions in sales to  one or more of our major oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the development of products for oem customer applications is characterized by a lengthy sales process and design in cycle which typically lasts from six months to two years and requires us to integrate our technologies into  and in certain cases adapt our products to fit  oem customers products 
in addition  our oem customers products are generally required to be certified by the fcc or the equivalent regulatory agency in each country where such products are sold 
we have committed substantial engineering  marketing and sales resources to develop key oem relationships and have broadened our oem customer base 
due to our current dependency on our oem customers for a significant percentage of our total revenue and the nature of our oem business  our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations as a result of the level and timing of oem customer orders 
we work closely with our oem customers to manage the order cycle process in an attempt to reduce the fluctuations inherent in our oem business 
our rangelan  rangelan ds and harmony branded products are marketed and sold to value added resellers  systems integrators and end users primarily through regional and national distributors 
our symphony  symphony homerf and farallon branded products are marketed and sold through pc macintosh and electronics retailers  computer catalogs  and on line retail sites over the internet  including our e commerce web site 
in addition  our symphony and symphony homerf products are marketed to oem and private label partners 
our stratum ghz ultra broadband products and stratum mp wireless bridge products are sold to value added resellers  systems integrators and end users primarily through regional and national distributors 
we grant certain distributors limited rights of return and price protection on unsold products 
product revenue on shipments to distributors  which have rights of return and price protection  is recognized upon shipment by the distributor 
many of our packaged products are also sold to oem customers 
results of operations three years ended december   and revenue increased by from million in to million in  and by from million in to million in revenue increased in compared to primarily due to increased unit shipments of ghz wireless lan product lines  including rangelan  symphony and symphony homerf products  in north america  europe and japan  stratum building to building products  and to a lesser extent harmony  rangelan ds and macintosh connectivity products 
the increases were partially offset by declining average selling prices for ghz wireless lan products  decreased revenue from mhz products and completion of non recurring engineering contracts recognized by micrilor  inc in revenue increased in compared to primarily due to increased unit shipments to distributors and oem customers that sell rangelan based ghz product lines in north america  europe and japan and  to a lesser extent  shipments of symphony and ghz stratum products 
the increases were partially offset by lower revenue from mhz products 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue was  and during   and  respectively 
included in cost of revenue in was a charge of  for amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and a charge of  related to first generation ieee inventories 
excluding the amortization and the charge  gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in excluding the amortization and the charge  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in compared to due primarily to declining average selling prices for rangelan and symphony products  an increase in revenue from lower margin symphony homerf and ghz stratum products and a decrease in revenue from higher gross margin mhz products 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased in compared to due to declining average selling prices on rangelan and symphony products  an increase in revenue from lower margin symphony and ghz stratum products and a decrease in revenue from higher gross margin mhz products 
we expect gross profit as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate in future periods depending primarily on the mix of revenue between existing ghz  ghz and mhz products  and potential manufacturing and technology license arrangements 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  consulting fees  prototype material  and other costs of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and software development 
research and development expenses are related primarily to the development and enhancement of radio transceivers  asics  wireless protocols and network software drivers 
research and development expenses increased by from million in to million in  and by from million in to million in research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the increased number of engineering employees  including employees added as a result of the wavespan merger and the siemens development group acquisition  continued investment in integrating our technology into asics development of wireless protocols and network software drivers  costs related to product performance enhancements  cost reductions in the rangelan architecture  costs related to both domestic and international product certifications  development of symphony and symphony homerf products  development of building to building products  development of harmony and rangelan ds products and development of ghz high speed wireless lan technology 
research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily due to an increased number of engineering employees  continued investment in integrating our technology into asics  development of wireless protocols and network software drivers  costs related to product performance enhancements  cost reductions in ghz products  costs related to both domestic and international product certifications  development of products based on the ieee standard  and development of ghz high speed wireless lan technology 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue declined in compared to  and in compared to primarily due to the increases in revenue  partially offset by increases in personnel and engineering development program costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute terms and fluctuate as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in technology to address potential market opportunities 
if we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
to date  all of our research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
purchased in process research and development consist primarily of acquired technology that has not reached technological feasibility and a minority investment in a technology company 
the amount expensed to purchased in process research and development in relates to in process technology acquired from the farallon and siemens development group purchase transactions 
in the second quarter of  based upon an independent third party valuation analysis  we charged  to purchased in process research and development related to technology acquired in the farallon purchase transaction which was calculated by estimating the fair value of the technology currently under development using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
in the third quarter of  based on an independent third party valuation analysis  we charged  to purchased in process research and development related to homerf technology acquired from the siemens development group transaction which was calculated by estimating the fair value of the technology currently under development using the income approach 
the amount charged to purchased in process research and development in included a  charge for developing ghz ultra broadband wireless technology 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon an independent third party valuation analysis  we also charged  to purchased in process research and development related to technology acquired in the wavespan purchase transaction which was calculated by estimating the fair value of the technology under development using the income approach 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include any anticipated synergies or cost savings associated with each transaction 
we expect that products incorporating the acquired technology will be completed and begin to generate cash flows between six to nine months after integration 
however  development of these technologies remain a significant risk due to the effort required to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share  or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on the value of assets acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions and other incentives  costs related to domestic and international product certifications  customer support  trade show and advertising expenses  charges related to investments in startup companies  issuance costs related to the acquisition of micrilor  communications and information systems  and to a lesser extent  professional fees and facilities costs 
selling  general and administration expenses increased by from million in to million in  and increased by from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the hiring of additional marketing and sales personnel to support our growth  particularly our expansion into international and consumer markets  employees added as a result of the wavespan and farallon acquisitions  increased trade show and promotional expenses   of issuance costs related to the acquisition of micrilor  and a  charge related to an investment in a startup internet service provider and a company developing internet appliances 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to primarily due to additional marketing and sales personnel to support our growth  particularly our expansion into international and consumer markets  as well as increased trade show and promotional expenses  partially offset by  charge related to an investment in a startup wireless services company in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to due to an increase in personnel costs  employees added as a result of acquisitions  issuance costs and charges related to investments  partially offset by increases in revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined in compared to due to the increases in revenue  partially offset by increases in personnel costs  and by the charge related to an investment in interest income  net of interest expense  increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher yields on cash balances 
interest income  net  increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher yields on cash balances 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of   and  in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in  and were   and  respectively 
the effective rates in and were higher than federal statutory rate of plus state tax rate of  net of federal benefits  primarily due to expenses related to the charges for purchased in process research and development and equity investments that were not deductible for income tax purpose 
such expenses amount to   and  in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate in was lower than the federal statutory tax rate plus the state tax rate  net of the federal benefits  primarily due to a research and development credit and a change in the valuation allowance offset by the non tax deductible expense related to the equity investment 
inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources to date we have funded our operations through sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   we had retained earnings of  in  cash used in operations was  in and  cash provided by operations was  and  respectively 
in  cash was used primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable and a decrease in other current liabilities  partially offset by net income after the effect of non cash charges 
in  cash was provided primarily by net income after the effect of non cash charges  partially offset by cash used to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease in other current liabilities 
in  cash was provided primarily by net income after the effect of non cash charges  a decrease in inventories and by an increase in accounts payable 
this was partially offset by cash used to fund increases in accounts receivable and by a decrease in other liabilities 
we believe that to the extent we experience growth in our operations  if any  then additional cash will be required to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable 
in  and  we purchased   and  respectively  of property and equipment 
expenditures related primarily to the acquisition of manufacturing and engineering test equipment  leasehold improvements  client server application software  and furniture for our new corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility 
we expect to purchase approximately  of property and equipment during  consisting primarily of manufacturing and engineering test equipment and tooling  and engineering systems software and equipment 
in  and  we made equity investments totaling   and  respectively 
in  we made investments in a wireless service provider  a company developing wireless internet appliances  a broadband gateway company and a company developing wireless services in china  of which  was recorded to selling  general and administrative expense due to the uncertainty in recovering the investments 
the remaining  was recorded as an equity investment 
in  we made investments in a wireless services company and a startup company developing ghz ultra broadband wireless products of which  was recorded as purchased in process research and development 
the remaining  was recorded as an equity investment 
the investment made in was for a wireless services company and was recorded as selling  general and administrative expense 
in june  the company acquired farallon communications  inc for  shares of our common stock and million of cash 
the total purchase price was million  including acquisition costs of  and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
in september  the company entered into a cross licensing and technology exchange and purchase agreement with siemens in which we acquired certain technology under development  intellectual property rights  engineering resources and other assets in exchange for certain manufacturing and technology rights and  shares of our common stock 
the total purchase price was million  including acquisition costs of  and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
in december  we acquired wavespan corporation in a merger transaction  for  shares of our common stock and million of cash 
the value of the purchase price was million  including acquisition costs of  and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
in  and  we generated   and  from issuance of common stock 
in we generated cash from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in we generated cash from the exercise of employee stock options  issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of common stock to investors 
in we generated cash from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december  our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to finance any cash acquisition  which we may consider and provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
however  to the extent that additional funds may be required in the future to address working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures  expansion of the business or acquisitions  we will consider additional financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable  if at all

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future on an annual and quarterly basis  due to numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include changing market demand for  and declines in the average selling prices of  our products  the timing of and delays or cancellations of significant orders from major customers  the loss of one or more of our major customers  the cost  availability and quality of components from our suppliers  the cost  availability  and quality of assemblies from contract and subcontract manufacturers  the lengthy sales and design in cycles for original equipment manufacturer  or oem  products  delays in the introduction of our new products  competitive product announcements and introductions  market adoption of new technologies  market adoption of radio frequency  or rf  standards based products such as those compliant with the homerf  ieee b  or bluetooth specifications  the mix of products sold  the effectiveness of our distribution channels and our success in maintaining our current distribution channels and developing new distribution channels  the sell through rate of our symphony and symphony homerf products through consumer retail channels  management of retail channel inventories  excess and obsolete inventories related to evolving product technologies and industry standards  the failure to anticipate changing customer product requirements  seasonality in demand  manufacturing capacity and efficiency  changes in the regulatory environment  product health and safety concerns  and general economic conditions 
historically  we have not operated with a significant order backlog and a substantial portion of our revenue in any quarter has been derived from orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
accordingly  our revenue expectations are based almost entirely on internal estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
planned operating expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based in large part on these estimates 
if orders and revenue do not meet expectations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this regard  in the third quarter of  we experienced a decrease in revenue and an operating loss as a result of a significant decrease in orders from two of our major customers 
we can offer no assurance that we will not experience future quarter to quarter decreases in revenue or quarterly operating losses 
in addition  due to the timing of orders from oem customers  we have often recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of a quarter 
as a result  minor fluctuations in the timing of orders and the shipment of products have caused  and may in the future cause  operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we depend significantly on a limited number of oem customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from a limited number of customers  most of which are oem customers 
sales to one customer represented approximately of our revenue during sales to one customer represented approximately of our revenue during sales to two customers represented approximately and of our revenue during we expect that sales to a limited number of oem customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we also have experienced quarter to quarter variability in sales to each of our major oem customers and expect this pattern to continue in the future 
sales of many of our wireless networking products depend upon the decision of a prospective oem customer to develop and market wireless solutions  which incorporate our wireless technology 
oem customers orders are affected by a variety of factors  including the following new product introductions  regulatory approvals  end user demand for oem customers products  product life cycles  inventory levels  manufacturing strategies  pricing  contract awards  competitive situations  and general economic conditions 
for these and other reasons  the design in cycle associated with the purchase of our wireless products by oem customers is quite lengthy  generally ranging from six months to two years  and is subject to a number of significant risks  including customers budgeting constraints and internal acceptance reviews  that are beyond our control 
because of the lengthy sales cycle  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of oem customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  our agreements with oem customers typically do not require minimum purchase quantities and a significant reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if revenue forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not realized in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of one or more of  or a significant reduction in orders from  our major oem customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we can offer no assurance that we will become a qualified supplier for new oem customers or that we will remain a qualified supplier for existing oem customers 
we purchase several key components used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources 
certain parts and components used in our products  including our proprietary application specific integrated circuits  or asics  monolithic microwave integrated circuits  or mmics  and assembled circuit boards  are only available from single sources  and certain other parts and components are only available from a limited number of sources 
our reliance on these sole source or limited source suppliers involves risks and uncertainties  including the following the possibility of a shortage or discontinuation of key components  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capability  quality  yields and costs 
any reduced availability of these parts or components when required could significantly impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis and result in the cancellation of orders  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the purchase of some key components involves long lead times and  in the event of unanticipated increases in demand for our products  we have in the past been  and may in the future be  unable to manufacture some products in a quantity sufficient to meet our customers demand in any particular period 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers  do not maintain an extensive inventory of parts or components  and customarily purchase sole or limited source parts and components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
business disruptions  production shortfalls  production quality or financial difficulties of a sole or limited source supplier could materially and adversely affect our business by increasing product costs  or reducing or eliminating the availability of parts or components 
in an event like this  our inability to develop alternative sources of supply quickly and on a cost effective basis could significantly impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis and could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to expand our limited manufacturing capability and increasingly depend on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing requirements 
we currently have limited manufacturing capability and no experience in large scale or foreign manufacturing 
if our customers were to concurrently place orders for unexpectedly large product quantities  our present manufacturing capacity might be inadequate to meet the demand 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to develop or contract for additional manufacturing capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
in addition  in order to compete successfully  we will need to achieve significant product cost reductions 
although we intend to achieve cost reductions through engineering improvements  production economies  and manufacturing at lower cost locations including outside the united states  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in order to remain competitive  we also must continue to introduce new products and processes into our manufacturing environment  and we can offer no assurance that any such new products will not create obsolete inventories related to older products 
we currently conduct our manufacturing operations for rangelan  harmony  stratum and mhz products at our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
in addition  we rely on contract and subcontract manufacturers for turnkey manufacturing and circuit board assemblies which subjects us to additional risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards and reduced control over the price  timely delivery and quality of such finished assemblies and assembled circuit boards 
if our sunnyvale facility were to become incapable of operating  even temporarily  or were unable to operate at or near our current or full capacity for an extended period  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we currently outsource manufacturing for our homerf products with flextronics international  inc  a top tier turnkey contract manufacturer 
we expect flextronics to provide domestic manufacturing for new product introductions and off shore manufacturing for lower cost high volume manufacturing of homerf products 
in addition  we expect flextronics to work directly with our homerf manufacturing license partners to manage product supply  factory capacity  product quality and manufacturability  and cost reductions 
changes in our manufacturing operations to incorporate new products and processes  or to manufacture at lower cost locations outside the united states  could cause disruptions  which  in turn  could adversely affect customer relationships  cause a loss of market opportunities and negatively affect our business and operating results 
we have in the past experienced higher than expected demand for our products 
this resulted in delays in the delivery of certain products due to temporary shortages of certain components  particularly components with long lead times  and insufficient manufacturing capacity 
due to the complex nature of our products and manufacturing processes  including products manufactured by our licensing partners  the worldwide demand for some wireless technology components and other factors  we can offer no assurance that delays in the delivery of products will not occur in the future 
wireless communications and networking markets are subject to rapid technological change and to compete  we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance 
the wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  we must develop or gain access to new technologies in order to increase product performance and functionality  reduce product size and maintain cost effectiveness 
our success is also dependent on our ability to develop new products for existing and emerging wireless communications markets  to introduce such products in a timely manner and to have them designed into new products developed by oem customers 
the development of new wireless networking products is highly complex  and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
due to the intensely competitive nature of our business  any delay in the commercial availability of new products could materially and adversely affect our business  reputation and operating results 
in addition  if we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced wireless networking technologies as they become available  or are unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  or are unable to hire or retain qualified engineers to develop new technologies and products  our future operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we have expended substantial resources in developing products that are designed to conform to the ieee standard and the homerf specification 
we can offer no assurance  however  that our ieee compliant products and our symphony homerf products will have a meaningful commercial impact 
in this regard  in the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of  to cost of sales related to first generation ieee inventories 
in  the ieee approved a new ghz wireless lan standard  designated as b 
based on direct sequence spread spectrum technology  this new standard increased the nominal data rate from mbps to mbps 
in october  we began to offer b products sourced from a third party developer and manufacturer  and there can be no assurance that our products will be competitive in the market 
in addition  we are developing higher speed frequency hopping technology based on the fcc part rule change adopted in august  that will allow for wider band hopping channels and increase the data rate from mbps to up to mbps 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete our development of mbps frequency hopping products in a timely manner  or that any such new products will compete effectively with ieee b standard compliant products 
in  a group of computer and telecommunications industry leaders  led by ericsson  began developing a short range rf method to connect mobile devices without cables called bluetooth 
based on low power ghz frequency hopping spread spectrum technology  numerous organizations are planning to deploy bluetooth technology in a wide variety of mobile devices such as cellular telephones  notebook computers and handheld computers 
we have not developed products that comply with bluetooth 
while bluetooth technology is available to develop or acquire in the market  there can be no assurance that we will develop or acquire such technology  or that if we do develop or acquire such technology  that our products will be competitive in the market 
in  the ieee approved a new ghz wireless lan standard designated as a 
this new standard is based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  or ofdm  technology with multiple data rates ranging from below mbps to approximately mbps 
in  the european telecommunications standards institute project bran broadband radio access networks committee approved a new ghz wireless lan standard designated as hiperlan  also based on ofdm technology 
while these two new ghz standards apply to future generations of technology  no companies are currently shipping wireless lan products based on these technologies 
we are currently working with a third party developer of a components developing products based on either of these two new standards  but there can be no assurance that we will develop or acquire technology compliant with these standards 
if we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
in this regard  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  to in process research and development related to a license of technology to be used in ghz highspeed in building wireless lan products 
in  we recorded a total of  in charges related to acquisition of ghz ultra broadband wireless building to building technology 
in addition  we are a core member of the homerf working group  an industry consortium that is establishing an open industry standard  called the homerf specification  for wireless digital communications between pcs and consumer electronic devices  including a common interface specification that supports wireless data and voice services in and around the home 
we can offer no assurance that the homerf specification  or the symphony homerf products that we have developed to comply with the specification will have a meaningful commercial impact 
further  given the emerging nature of the wireless lan market  we can offer no assurance that the rangelan and symphony products and technology  or our other products or technology  will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies 
if we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products  we may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
in this regard  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of  to in process research and development related to a license of technology to be used in ghz highspeed in building wireless lan products 
in  we recorded a total of  in charges related to the acquisition of ghz ultra broadband wireless building to building products 
in second quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to acquisition of products that address home and small office networking requirements  as well as apple macintosh computer connectivity 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of  related to the acquisition of homerf technology 
the wireless local area networking market is intensely competitive and some of our competitors are larger and better established 
the wireless local area networking and building to building markets are extremely competitive and we expect that competition will intensify in the future 
increased competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressures  the loss of market share and other factors 
the principal competitive factors include the following data throughput  effective rf coverage area  interference immunity  network scalability  price  integration with voice technology  wireless networking protocol sophistication  ability to support industry standards  roaming capability  power consumption  product miniaturization  product reliability  ease of use  product costs  product features and applications  product time to market  product certifications  brand recognition  oem partnerships  marketing alliances  manufacturing capabilities and experience  effective distribution channels  and company reputation 
we could be at a disadvantage to competitors  particularly cisco systems and lucent technologies  that have broader distribution channels  brand recognition  extensive patent portfolios and more diversified product lines 
we have several competitors in our commercial wireless business  including without limitation breezecom  cisco systems which acquired aironet wireless communications  intersil  lucent technologies  nokia  symbol technologies  western multiplex and com 
we also face competition from a variety of companies that offer different technologies in the nascent home networking market  including several companies developing competing wireless networking products 
additionally  numerous companies have announced their intention to develop competing products in both the commercial wireless and home networking markets 
in addition to competition from companies that offer or have announced their intention to develop wireless lan products  we could face future competition from companies that offer products which replace network adapters or offer alternative communications solutions  or from large computer companies  pc peripheral companies  as well as other large networking equipment companies 
furthermore  we could face competition from certain of our oem customers  which have  or could acquire  wireless engineering and product development capabilities 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these competitors or those competitive pressures we face will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
many of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and distribution of their products 
these competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the wireless lan and building to building markets  obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products  or otherwise gain a competitive advantage 
we can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors 
furthermore  we compete with companies that have high volume manufacturing and extensive marketing and distribution capabilities  areas in which we have only limited experience 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as the wireless lan market evolves and the level of competition increases 
the market for integrated voice and data products and combined services may not grow as anticipated 
in  we announced our homerf product family designed to integrate both voice communications and data networking on a shared frequency basis 
a substantial part of our future growth is dependent on the widespread deployment of these integrated voice and data products for combined voice and data services 
to date  service providers including competitive telephone carriers have not deployed such combined services broadly 
unless such products are broadly deployed we can offer no assurance that our symphony homerf integrated voice and data products will have a meaningful commercial impact 
if such growth does not occur as anticipated  this could contribute to significant variations in our future operating results 
we depend upon international sales and our ability to sustain and increase international sales is subject to many risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
revenue from shipments by us to customers outside the united states  principally to a limited number of distributors and oem customers  represented  and of total revenue during  and we expect that revenue from shipments to international customers will vary as a percentage of total revenue 
sales to international customers or to us oem customers who ship to international locations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license and documentation requirements  tariffs  duties taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  longer payment cycles for international distributors  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  competition from local manufacturers with lower costs  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potential political and economic instability 
while international sales are typically denominated in us dollars and we typically extend limited credit terms  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we can offer no assurance that foreign markets will continue to develop or that we will receive additional orders to supply our products to foreign customers 
our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected if foreign markets do not continue to develop or if we do not receive additional orders to supply our products for use by foreign customers 
in the latter part of and throughout  capital markets in asia were highly volatile  resulting in fluctuations in asian currencies and other economic instabilities 
in this regard  in the third quarter of and continuing through the second quarter of  we experienced a significant decrease in orders from ntt it  one of our major japanese customers  resulting in a significant decrease in quarterly revenue and an operating loss in the third quarter of our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  non disclosure agreements  invention assignment agreements and other security measures in order to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have been issued ten us patents  which are important to our current business  and we have five patent applications pending in the us which relate to our core technologies and product designs 
we can offer no assurance that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents do issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we can offer no assurance that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will adequately protect us 
since us patent applications are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  and since publication of inventions in the technical or patent literature tends to lag behind such inventions by several months  we cannot be certain that we first created the inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions or that we are not infringing on the patents of others 
in addition  we have filed  or reserved our rights to file  a number of patent applications internationally 
we can offer no assurance that any international patent application will issue or that the laws of foreign jurisdictions will protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
although we intend to protect our proprietary rights vigorously  there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or may take to protect our proprietary rights will be successful 
we expect that litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  trademarks or other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  to establish the validity of any technology licenses offered to patent infringers  to prevent the importation of infringing products into the united states  or to defend against claims of infringement 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
moreover  we can offer no assurance that in the future these rights will be upheld 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any of our issued patents will provide a competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not adversely impact our ability to do business 
as the number of products in the wireless lan market increases  and related features and functions overlap  we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
these claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
any such claims  with or without merit  could cause costly litigation and could require significant management time 
there can be no assurance that  if required  we could obtain such royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us 
there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken or may take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or that others will not independently develop similar products  design around our proprietary or patented technology or duplicate our products 
we need to effectively manage our growth 
our growth to date has caused  and will continue to cause  a significant strain on our management  operational  financial and other resources 
our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to improve our management  operational and financial processes and controls as well as the related information and communications systems 
these demands will require the addition of new management personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing management 
the failure of our management team to effectively manage growth  should it occur  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
compliance with governmental regulations in multiple jurisdictions where we sell our products is difficult and costly 
in the united states  we are subject to various federal communications commission  or fcc  rules and regulations 
current fcc regulations permit license free operation in certain fcc certified bands in the radio spectrum 
our spread spectrum wireless products are certified for unlicensed operation in the mhz  ghz  ghz and ghz frequency bands 
operation in these frequency bands is governed by rules set forth in part of the fcc regulations 
the part rules are designed to minimize the probability of interference to other users of the spectrum and  thus  accord part systems secondary status in the frequency 
in the event that there is interference between a primary user and a part user  a higher priority user can require the part user to curtail transmissions that create interference 
in this regard  if users of our products experience excessive interference from primary users  market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
the fcc  however  has established certain standards that create an irrefutable presumption of noninterference for part users and we believe that our products comply with such requirements 
we can offer no assurance that the occurrence of regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  changes in the use of allocated frequency spectrum  or modification to the standards establishing an irrefutable presumption for unlicensed part users  would not significantly affect our operations by rendering current products obsolete  restricting the applications and markets served by our products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
our products are also subject to regulatory requirements in international markets and  therefore  we must monitor the development of spread spectrum and other radio frequency regulations in certain countries that represent potential markets for our products 
while we can offer no assurance that we will be able to comply with regulations in any particular country  we design our rangelan  rangelan ds  harmony  symphony and symphony homerf products to minimize the design modifications required to meet various ghz international spread spectrum regulations 
in addition  we will seek to obtain international certifications for the symphony and symphony homerf product line in countries where there is a substantial market for home pcs and internet connectivity 
changes in  or the failure by us to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  with respect to those countries that do not follow fcc regulations  we may need to modify our products to meet local rules and regulations 
regulatory changes by the fcc or by regulatory agencies outside the united states  including changes in the allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly affect our operations by restricting our development efforts  rendering current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
in september and in february  the fcc allocated additional spectrum for personal communications services 
in january  the fcc authorized mhz of additional unlicensed frequencies in the ghz frequency range in part subpart e which regulates u nii devices operating in the ghz and ghz frequency bands 
in august  the fcc issued an amendment to part that changed the way allocated frequencies are utilized by frequency hoppingspread spectrum systems 
these approved changes in the allocation and use of available frequency spectrum could create opportunities for other wireless networking products and services 
there can be no assurance that new regulations will not be promulgated  that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
there may be potential health and safety risks related to our products which could negatively affect our business and product sales 
the intentional emission of electromagnetic radiation has been the subject of recent public concern regarding possible health and safety risks  and though our products  when installed in any of the intended configurations  are designed not to exceed the maximum permissible exposure limits listed in section of the fcc regulations  we can offer no assurance that safety issues will not arise in the future and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete effectively  we must establish and expand new distribution channels for our home networking products 
to date  a substantial percentage of our revenue has been derived from oem customers through our direct sales force 
we sell our branded rangelan products through domestic and international distributors 
we are also establishing new distribution channels for our symphony family of cordless home and small office networking products 
symphony products are currently sold through national retailers such as best buy  compusa  officemax  office depot and staples computer retailers such as fry s electronics  j r computer world  brandsmart  comp u tech  datavision  nationwide  leading computer catalogs such as cdw  mobileplanet and pc connection  and numerous on line retail sites over the internet  including our e commerce web site at www 
proxim 
com 
in general  distributors and retailers offer products of several different companies  including products that may compete with our products 
accordingly  they may give higher priority to products of other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
agreements with distributors and retailers are generally terminable at their option 
any reduction in sales efforts or termination of a relationship may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
use of distributors and retailers also entails the risk that they will build up inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales 
if such growth does not occur as anticipated  they may substantially decrease the amount of product ordered in subsequent quarters 
such fluctuations could contribute to significant variations in our future operating results 
if we lose key personnel or we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to effectively manage our business or achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the technical and management skills of our key employees  in particular david c 
king  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and juan grau  vice president of engineering 
we do not have employment agreements with or life insurance on the life of  either person 
in addition  given the rapid technological change in this industry  we believe that the technical expertise and creative skills of our engineers and other personnel are crucial in determining our future success 
the loss of the services of any key employee could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our success also depends in large part on a limited number of key marketing and sales employees and on our ability to continue to attract  assimilate and retain additional highly talented personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the wireless data communications and networking industries is intense 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our key employees or that we can attract  assimilate or retain the additional skilled personnel as required 
our stock price may be extremely volatile 
recently  the price of our common stock has been volatile 
we believe that the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  as a result of factors including announcements of developments relating to our business  fluctuations in our operating results  general conditions in the wireless communications industry or the worldwide economy  a shortfall in revenue or earnings from securities analysts expectations or other changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by us or our competitors  developments in patent  copyright or other intellectual property rights  and developments in our relationships with customers  distributors and suppliers 
in the third quarter of  we announced revenue and operating results below expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of high technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to our performance 
risks related to the proposed merger with netopia proxim will face significant challenges in integrating proxim and netopia and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of the merger 
integrating the operations  systems and personnel of proxim and netopia will be a complex process  and proxim is uncertain that the integration will be completed in a timely manner or will achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the challenges involved in this integration include retaining relationships with existing customers and business partners of both proxim and netopia  retaining and integrating management and other employees of both proxim and netopia  minimizing disruption of the combined company s ongoing business and distraction of its management  coordinating research and development and marketing activities to enhance introduction of new products  services and technologies that integrate proxim s and netopia s existing technologies and technologies under development  transitioning systems to a common information technology system  developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and limiting expenses related to integration of the two companies 
the combined company may not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger 
the diversion of the attention of the combined company s management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of proxim s and netopia s businesses 
if proxim does not successfully integrate netopia or if the operating results of the combined company do not meet the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts  the market price of proxim common stock may decline 
the market price of proxim common stock may decline as a result of the merger if the integration of proxim and netopia is not completed in a timely and efficient manner  the effect of the merger on the combined company s financial results or the perceived benefits of the merger are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts  netopia s business model and operations  considered separately  require proxim to expend additional capital to fund operating losses of these operations  or significant stockholders of proxim following the merger decide to dispose of their shares because the results of the merger are not consistent with their expectations 
as a result of the merger  some of proxim s customers and business partners may curtail or not do business with the combined company  which could cause a decline in the sales of the combined company 
the announcement and consummation of the merger may cause some of proxim s customers and business partners to end or curtail their relationships with the combined company 
some of proxim s current customers offer broadband internet equipment that competes with netopia s products 
in addition  proxim has oem relationships with third parties which compete with business partners of netopia 
these business partners may decide not to do business or may curtail their relationships with the combined company 
the loss or reduction in sales to these customers and business partners could cause a decline in sales of the combined company 
if we are not able to integrate the technologies of proxim and netopia into integrated networking solutions in a timely and efficient manner  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger 
the combined company intends to develop and market a single box residential gateway that will provide wide area and local area voice and data services over dsl  cable  wireless or any other type of broadband access 
in order to achieve its strategic objectives  the combined company must integrate the technologies of proxim and netopia into products that are competitively priced and easy to install  configure and use 
the development of integrated networking products is highly complex 
from time to time  both proxim and netopia have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
if the combined company is not able to successfully develop and market these products in a timely and cost effective manner  or if these new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger 
the growth of our business will depend in part on the growth of the market for integrated residential gateway products and our ability to meet the needs of this market  which we are unable to predict 
the growth of our business will depend in part on the development of a market for integrated residential gateway products 
the market for these products is rapidly evolving 
if these products are not widely adopted by carriers and service providers  we may not realize the expected benefits of the merger and our business and results of operations may be harmed 
some of the critical issues concerning adoption of these products  including price  ease of deployment and use and quality of service  remain unresolved and  if we are unable to address these issues  our business may be harmed 
the market for residential gateway products may not develop as we expect  and even if it does  we may not be able to compete successfully in this market 
if we are unable to take advantage of opportunities to market and sell proxim s and netopia s products and services to each other s traditional customers  distribution channels and business partners  we may not realize some of the expected benefits of the merger 
prior to the merger  proxim and netopia have each maintained separate and distinct customer bases  distribution channels and business partners specific to their respective wirefree networking and broadband internet equipment businesses 
following the merger  the combined company expects to take advantage of the customer bases and distribution of the formerly separate proxim and netopia businesses in order to promote and sell the products and services of one company to the traditional customers and business partners of the other company 
the products and services of proxim and netopia are highly technical and the salespersons of one company may not be successful in marketing the products and services of the other company 
in the event that the traditional customers and business partners of either proxim or netopia are not receptive to the products and services of the other  we may not realize some of the expected benefits of the merger  and the business of the combined company may be harmed 
proxim and netopia may lose key personnel  customers and business partners due to uncertainties associated with the merger 
current and prospective employees  customers and business partners of proxim and netopia may experience uncertainty about their future relationships with the combined company 
such uncertainty may adversely affect the combined company s ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
current and prospective customers and business partners may  in response to the announcement or consummation of the merger  delay or cancel purchasing decisions 
any delay in  or cancellation of  in purchasing decisions could adversely affect the business of the combined company 
proxim s operating results could be harmed as a result of purchase accounting treatment  the impact of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles relating to the merger 
under united states generally accepted accounting principles that apply to proxim  proxim will account for the merger using the purchase method of accounting 
proxim will record the market value of its common stock issued in connection with the merger  the fair market value of the options to purchase netopia common stock that will be converted into options to purchase proxim common stock  and the amount of direct transaction costs as the total cost of acquiring the business of netopia 
proxim will allocate that cost to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology  acquired trademarks and trade names and acquired workforce  to deferred compensation for the intrinsic value of unvested options to purchase netopia common stock  and to in process research and development  based on their respective fair values 
netopia s in process research and development  which is currently estimated at million  will be expensed in the quarter when the merger closes 
intangible assets  including goodwill  generally will be amortized over a period of three to five years 
deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting period of stock options  estimated to be years 
the amount of purchase cost allocated to goodwill and other intangibles is estimated to be approximately million 
if goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized in equal quarterly amounts over a five year period following completion of the merger  the accounting charge attributable to these items would be approximately million per quarter and million per fiscal year 
as a result  purchase accounting treatment of the merger will decrease the net income of proxim in the foreseeable future  which could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of proxim common stock following completion of the merger 
these amounts are only estimates  however  and the actual amounts as determined at the effective time of the merger may differ from these estimates 
failure to complete the merger could negatively impact our business and the market price of our common stock 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  we will be subject to a number of risks that may affect our business and stock price  including the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of such shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed  costs related to the merger  such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment banking fees  must be paid even if the merger is not completed  benefits that we expect to realize from the merger  such as the potentially enhanced financial and competitive position of the combined company  would not be realized  and the diversion of management attention from the day to day business and the unavoidable disruption to our employees and our relationships with customers and suppliers during the period before consummation of the merger  may make it difficult for us to regain our financial and market position if the merger does not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of government and corporate bonds purchased with an average maturity of less than one year 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio
