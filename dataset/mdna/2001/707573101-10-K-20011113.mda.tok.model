the foregoing is more fully discussed below 
the terms of the settlement did not deviate in any material respect from the terms previously reported except that the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the settlement see below was reduced from  to  as a result of a decrease in the market value of the company s common stock

under current mexican law  foreign ownership of mexican entities involved in the distribution of lpg or the operation of lpg terminal facilities is prohibited 
foreign ownership is permitted in the transportation and storage of lpg 
mexican law also provides that a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage or distribution 
pennmex has a transportation permit and the mexican subsidiaries own  lease  or are in the process of obtaining the land or rights of way used in the construction of the mexican portion of the us mexico pipelines  and own the mexican portion of the assets comprising the us mexico pipelines and matamoros terminal facility 
the company s mexican affiliate  tergas  sa de sa tergas  has been granted the permit to operate the matamoros terminal facility and the company relies on tergas permit to continue its delivery of lpg at the matamoros terminal facility 
tergas is owned by jorge bracamontes  an officer and director of the company and the remaining balance is owned by another officer and a consultant of the company 
the company pays tergas its actual cost for distribution services at the matamoros terminal facility plus a small profit 
termatsal has completed construction of an additional lpg terminal facility in saltillo  mexico the saltillo terminal facility for approximately  the saltillo terminal facility is capable of off loading lpg from railcars to trucks 
the saltillo terminal facility contains storage to accommodate approximately  gallons of lpg with additional storage planned for  gallons 
the saltillo terminal facility has three railcar off loading racks and three truck loading racks 
as a result of the saltillo terminal facility  the company can transport lpg directly via railcar from the brownsville terminal facility to the saltillo terminal facility 
the saltillo terminal facility has not begun operations due to concerns by local residents in saltillo 
if such concerns cannot be resolved  the company may relocate the tangible assets comprising the saltillo terminal facility to a remote location 
the cost of such relocation is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
tergas leases the land on which the saltillo terminal facility is located and has been granted the permit to operate the saltillo terminal facility 
the land is leased through january for  annually 
under the terms of the land lease agreement  any leasehold improvements at the termination of the lease may be removed

the company is leasing the railcars on a month to month basis 
the saltillo terminal facility is not operational 
the company has utilized some of the railcars in connection with sales of lpg to us and canadian customers 
through its operations in mexico and the operations of the mexican subsidiaries and tergas  the company is subject to the tax laws of mexico which  among other things  require that the company comply with transfer pricing rules  the payment of income  asset and ad valorem taxes  and possibly taxes on distributions in excess of earnings 
in addition  distributions to foreign corporations  including dividends and interest payments may be subject to withholding taxes 
deregulation of the lpg industry in mexico 
the mexican petroleum industry is governed by the ley reglarmentaria del art culo constitutional en el ramo del petr leo the regulatory law to article of the constitution of mexico concerning petroleum affairs the regulatory law  and ley org nica del petr leos mexicanos y organismos subsidiarios the organic law of petr leos mexicanos and subsidiary entities the organic law 
under mexican law and related regulations  pemex is entrusted with the central planning and the strategic management of mexico s petroleum industry  including importation  sales and transportation of lpg 
in carrying out this role  pemex controls pricing and distribution of various petrochemical products  including lpg 
beginning in  as part of a national privatization program  the regulatory law was amended to permit private entities to transport  store and distribute natural gas with the approval of the ministry of energy 
as part of this national privatization program  the mexican government is expected to deregulate the lpg market deregulation 
in june  the regulatory law for lpg was changed to permit foreign entities to participate without limitation in the defined lpg activities related to transportation and storage 
however  foreign entities are prohibited from participating in the distribution of lpg in mexico 
upon deregulation  mexican entities will be able to import lpg into mexico 
under mexican law  a single entity is not permitted to participate in more than one of the defined lpg activities transportation  storage and distribution 
the company or its affiliates expect to sell lpg directly to independent mexican distributors as well as pmi upon deregulation 
the company anticipates that the independent mexican distributors will be required to obtain authorization from the mexican government for the importation of lpg upon deregulation prior to entering into contracts with the company 
during july  the mexican government announced that it would begin to accept applications from mexican companies for permits to allow for the importation of lpg pursuant to provisions already provided for under existing mexican law 
in connection with the above  in august  tergas received a permit from the mexican government to import lpg 
tergas also received authorization from mexican custom authorities regarding the use of the us mexico pipelines for the importation of lpg 
although by virtue of the permit  tergas is currently able to import lpg into mexico  the mexican government has asked tergas to defer use of the permit and as a result the company has not sold lpg to distributors other than pmi 
as a result of the foregoing it is uncertain as to when  if ever  deregulation will actually occur and the effect  if any  it will have on the company 
the point of sale for lpg which flows through the us mexico pipelines for delivery to the matamoros terminal facility is the united states mexico border
