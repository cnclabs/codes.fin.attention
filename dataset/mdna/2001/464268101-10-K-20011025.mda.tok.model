the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of the factors set forth below in the section entitled factors effecting future results and elsewhere in this document 
all references to years mean our fiscal year 
sales analysis and review to comparison our sales for the year ended july  of  were three percent above fiscal sales of  removing the impact of geomation from both fiscal years  sales were up four percent 
sales of our core products wastewater samplers  flow meters  and liquid chromatography products were up seven percent or increased by  over last year 
sampler and chromatography sales increased by percent or  and percent or  respectively over the prior year while flow meter sales declined by nine percent or  the under performance in sales of flow meter sales for the current fiscal year was the result of a number of factors  including the disruption in product management 
sales of our non core products process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  syringe pumps  and geomation products were down by  or percent from last year 
sales of non core products were impacted by the reduction in sales associated with geomation due to the sale of the net assets of this entity at the beginning of this fiscal year 
sales of our non core products were down six percent for the year after removing sales of geomation products from both fiscal years results 
the sales decline was driven by lower sales of sfe products partially offset by increased sales of syringe pump products 
us sales for the year were up three percent 
us sales of our core products for the year increased eight percent over fiscal sales of samplers and liquid chromatography products accounted for the increase  offset by a decline in flow meter products 
us sales of our non core products were down percent 
removing the impact of geomation  sales of non core products decreased percent over last year 
sales of sfe products accounted for the decline  offset somewhat by increased sales of syringe pump products 
international sales for the year were up four percent 
international sales of our core products for the same period increased five percent over last year 
for the year  all of our core products showed sales increases 
international sales of our non core products for the year increased by two percent 
removing the impact of geomation  sales of non core products increased by five percent over last year 
this increase was driven by sales of both sfe and syringe pump products 
during the year we received net orders of million 
net orders received were up six percent  a million increase compared with last year 
removing the impact of geomation from both fiscal years  fiscal year net orders were up nine percent over the prior year 
the order backlog at july  was million  up approximately percent from the beginning of the fiscal year 
the order backlog at july  included  for geomation 
as of september  our order backlog was  the majority of which is scheduled for delivery prior to july   the close of fiscal to comparison our sales for the year ended july  of  were six percent above fiscal sales of  sales of our core products wastewater samplers  flow meters  and liquid chromatography products were up percent or increased by  over the prior year 
liquid chromatography sales accounted for percent or  of the increase in core product sales  samplers accounted for percent or  and flow meters accounted for four percent or  sales of our other products process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  syringe pumps  and geomation were comparable to fiscal levels 
increased sales of sfe and syringe pumps products were offset by a decline in sales of geomation products 
us sales of our core products increased percent over fiscal  with chromatography accounting for the majority of this increase 
us sales of our other products process monitoring  supercritical fluid extraction sfe  syringe pumps  and geomation increased by percent compared to fiscal sfe and process monitoring domestic sales increased while syringe pump and geomation sales were down compared to fiscal international sales of our core products increased by eight percent 
liquid chromatography products accounted for the majority of the international sales increase 
international sales of non core products were down percent 
the increase in sales of syringe pumps was more than offset by declines in sales of geomation and process monitoring products 
we received net orders of  this was comparable to net orders of  received in fiscal the order backlog at july  was  down percent from the beginning of the year 
operating income analysis and review the following table summarizes  for the three years indicated  the percentages that certain components of the consolidated statements of operations bear to net sales and the percentage change of such components based on actual dollars compared with the prior year 
year ended year to year increase decrease jul jul jul vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales expenses selling  general  and administrative research and engineering loss on impairments and sale of geomation erp settlement write off operating income loss non operating income investment income interest expense other earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net earnings loss the operating performances over the last four years have been negatively impacted by significant non recurring charges 
these items are identified under item  selected financial data 
pro forma data has been included in this selected financial data that removes the impact of these non recurring charges and the operations of geomation since fiscal to comparison we had operating income of  for fiscal compared with a loss of  for fiscal  an improvement of  there were several one time items and a change in classification that impacted the results of both years and impacted the year over year improvement 
fiscal year incurred charges of  related to the write off of the erp operating system   related to the loss on impairments and disposition of geomation  and  from geomation s operations 
fiscal year operating income reflects a  benefit from the settlement of our erp lawsuit along with the benefit of  from the change in classification of net gain on sales of capitalized equipment that was reported as other income in prior years 
adjusting for the impact of these items to operating income  we incurred a decrease in operating income of approximately  this decrease was due primarily to increased selling expenses greater than the increased gross margin dollars generated on the higher sales volume 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent for fiscal year  the same level as in the reported selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  remained level at percent for fiscal and fiscal and on a dollar basis increased by  fiscal year included expenses related to the geomation operations of approximately  for the year compared to fiscal expenses of  excluding the effects of the geomation operations  sg a  as a percentage of sales  increased from percent to percent from fiscal to fiscal and increased by  the increases are attributable to planned increases in sales and marketing personnel accounting for  of the increase  increased selling commissions of approximately  and various other areas such as travel and product promotional expenditures 
research and engineering expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased slightly from percent to percent from fiscal to fiscal and on a dollar basis declined by  for the year 
fiscal year included costs associated with the geomation operations of approximately  while fiscal year costs were  excluding the effects of the geomation operations  research and engineering expenses  as a percentage of sales  remained at percent for both fiscal years and increased by  the increase is attributable to subcontracted product development activities 
in total  non operating income declined by  for the year 
investment income increased by  due to a larger investment balance available in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in investment income was offset by decreases in other non operating income due to the net proceeds on the sales of used equipment being reported in net sales and costs of sales in fiscal non operating income included net proceeds on the sale of capitalized equipment of  in fiscal our effective income tax rate for the year ended july  was percent 
for last year our effective income tax rate was percent 
the current year s effective rate was lower then the statutory rate due to tax benefits associated with isco s foreign sales corporation and changes in the valuation allowance 
the prior year s effective rate was significantly reduced due to the non deductibility on the write off of the intangible assets related to the disposition of geomation 
to comparison we incurred an operating loss of  for fiscal compared with a loss of  for fiscal during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  management determined that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to sell the geomation operations 
this decision was a result of reviewing the strategic fit of geomation with the overall isco strategy and the deterioration in the operating performance of geomation during fiscal this decision resulted in recording a  operating loss on the impairments and disposition of geomation assets 
the net operating assets of geomation were sold on october  to an investment group led by the current management of geomation 
details related to this sale are disclosed in note o of the financial statements 
during the third quarter of the fiscal year  management decided not to complete the suspended implementation of the erp operating system at the isco lincoln facility 
this implementation project was originally suspended during the third quarter of fiscal year because of continual software instability problems 
this decision resulted in a non cash operating charge of  for fiscal year fiscal was negatively impacted from the write off of undepreciated building components and associated charges incurred with the renovation of the superior street facility  resulting in the recording of an impairment loss of  removing the impact of the impairments  write offs  and disposition charges  operating income would have been  for fiscal and the operating loss for fiscal would have been  resulting in a year over year improvement of  this improvement is due to an improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the gross margin  as a percentage of sales  improved to percent in from percent in this improvement was the result of several factors 
we generated operational improvements at our isco lincoln facility that resulted in reduced indirect manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
these improvements resulted in approximately a  to  increase in profitability 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in sales margins on process monitoring equipment  which had a margin impact of approximately  we reduced our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses by  and approximately five percent as a percentage of sales from the fiscal year level 
this improvement was due to focused marketing reductions at stip and advertising cutbacks  accounting for approximately of the reduction 
in addition  fiscal year was impacted by costs related to the yk conversion activity  providing for the majority of the remaining cost decrease 
research and engineering expenses declined by  and by approximately two percent as a percentage of sales from the fiscal year level 
this improvement was a result of reductions in staffing at isco lincoln and the timing of expenditures for product development projects 
investment income increased by approximately percent compared to last year 
this increase was a result of increased excess cash reserves available for investment in fiscal over fiscal interest expense increased by approximately percent compared to last year 
this increase was due to the loan  obtained by isco lincoln in december  only being in place for a portion of fiscal other non operating income decreased by approximately percent compared to  resulting from reductions in the net proceeds on the sale of capitalized equipment 
we recognized a net tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent for the current year compared with a net tax benefit of  or an effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent last year 
the current year s effective rate was significantly reduced due to the non deductibility on the write off of the intangible assets related to the disposition of geomation 
tax benefits generated by isco s foreign sales corporation helped to offset this impact 
last year s tax benefit was reduced by the establishment of a valuation allowance against the tax benefits generated on the net operating losses incurred by stip and geomation 
liquidity and capital resources our overall cash and investments increased to million from million  an increase of million 
operating activities generated million of cash flow during fiscal compared with million during fiscal this increase is due to improved operational performance and balance sheet management 
the net income for fiscal year adjusted for depreciation  changes in deferred taxes  and other miscellaneous non cash changes provided us with million of cash from operations in addition to the million of cash flow from net operating assets 
the cash flow generated from operating assets came primarily from improvements in our accounts receivable and inventory management 
in fiscal the net loss when adjusted for depreciation  the write off of the erp system  and the loss on the impairments and disposition of geomation assets provided us with million of cash from operations before million of investments in net operating assets 
we invested the cash generated from operations and maturities of investments held at the end of fiscal into long term and short term investments of million and used cash of million for the repayment of debt 
our net cash position increased by million for fiscal year compared to a net cash decrease of million in fiscal year at july   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of at year end  our total long term debt was million with million payable next year 
in addition  we had lines of credit with various banks totaling million of which million was available for future business needs 
factors affecting future results during fiscal year  we focused on identifying and implementing marketing and selling activities intended to grow sales  improve operational performance and profits  and improve our management of working capital 
although sales were up four percent compared with last year and orders were up seven percent  both were lower than our internal goals 
however  in the context of a difficult global economy  we feel these results are reasonable 
although we are disappointed that net income from continuing operations declined somewhat  we are comfortable that our decision to maintain our planned spending increase in sales and marketing programs and infrastructure was sound  even though orders and sales were below budget 
after two years of declining spending in sales and marketing  we feel these current investments will lead to profitable sales growth 
we generated additional cash flow due to our improvements in accounts receivable and inventory turns 
looking forward to fiscal year and beyond  we feel that we can increase shareholder value through consistent growth in sales and income  coupled with efficient asset utilization 
we have programs and activities in place to achieve these goals 
however  the current unsettled global economic and political situation makes near term performance uncertain 
consequently  we have implemented a conservative sales budget and profit plan for fiscal although we are anticipating sales growth  the realities of a post september th world could put our performance at risk 
with approximately percent of our sales coming from the regulatory driven environmental market  we recognize that we may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in governmental funding 
additionally  the strength of the us dollar places pressure on our international business 
internally  we will continue to focus on improvements to our operations related to efficiencies and balance sheet management 
we will continue to use product and market development as a means to achieve sales growth 
our strong financial position will allow us to selectively increase product development  sales  and marketing expenditures to capitalize on value creating opportunities 
we are increasing funding for the commercialization of the monolithic media technology for chromatographic columns 
this is a strategic project that will require sales and marketing expenditures above our historical spending levels 
although we expect some short term downward pressure on earnings  we believe that the success of this program will build additional value for our shareholders 
the consolidation of companies within our water quality market is ongoing 
as a result  we are dealing with the effects of larger  well financed competitors who also have the organizational resources and breadth of product lines to compete aggressively in the global marketplace 
while we feel that we can effectively compete with these larger organizations on the basis of agility  speed  and responsiveness  they do continue to represent a potent threat 
market risk interest rate risk and currency exchange risks are the primary market risks to which we are exposed 
we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments 
our other financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts and notes payable  and long term debt 
our cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  and accounts and notes payable balances are generally short term in nature and do not expose our company to material market risk 
at july   we had approximately million of fixed rate debt 
in addition  we had million of variable rate credit facilities  of which approximately million was outstanding under these credit facilities 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates on the debt and credit facilities would have a material effect on our results of operations  given our current obligations under these debt and credit facilities 
related to currency exchange  international sales of our united states based operations are denominated in us dollars and international sales of our german subsidiary are denominated in deutsche marks 
the currency exchange risk at the current level of activity is not material to our operating results or financial position 
our market risk resulting from the translation of the profit and loss of stip and from our permanent investment in our foreign subsidiaries is not material 
inflation the effect of inflation on our costs and our ability to pass on cost increases in the form of increased prices is dependent upon market conditions and the competitive environment 
the general level of inflation in the us economy has been relatively low for the past several years and has not  to date  had a significant effect on the cost of acquiring materials for production
