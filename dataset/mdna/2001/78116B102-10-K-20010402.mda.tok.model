item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
see risk factors under item  of part i of this report regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in and grew steadily through  at which time we operated units 
we accelerated the number of restaurant openings in recent years  going from six new restaurants in to in as a result of our expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new unit opens  it will typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs until new personnel gain experience 
hourly labor schedules are gradually adjusted downward during the first three months of a restaurant opening  in order to reach operating efficiencies similar to those at established units 
in calculating our comparable restaurant base  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for calendar months 
revenues represent gross restaurant sales less coupons and other discounts and includes franchise revenue for cost of sales is composed of food  beverage  and paper supply expense 
components of restaurant labor  occupancy and other expenses include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  fringe benefit costs  rent and other occupancy costs  advertising and promotion  operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs  and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees and includes franchise expense for pre opening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial workforce  travel  the cost of food used in training  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to opening 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between  and refer to the week period ended december   the week period ended december   and the week period ended december   respectively  unless otherwise indicated 
our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows fiscal revenue costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor  occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses loss on asset impairment operating loss income other income expense interest income expense  net miscellaneous income expense  net loss on disposal sale of property total other income  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income includes  in franchise revenue for includes  in franchise expense for weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and partial period operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  results of operations also reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  revenue 
restaurant sales increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in included restaurant sales of approximately million for the additional week 
the increase was also due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base yet  combined with the million from the units opened in in addition  total sales from all units that comprise our comparable base increased million weeks vs 
week basis 
comparable unit sales on a week vs 
week basis were up  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the positive increase in comparable store sales was due to a increase in the average check amount  offset by a decrease in transactions due to the limited success of promotional efforts in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  primarily due to inefficiencies in our new markets and higher costs incurred relating to certain menu changes made in july restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other increased as a percentage of sales to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of sales is due in part to an increase in total direct labor of 
these labor increases were due to expected inefficiencies in the new stores  increasing mix of stores located in newer markets which have on average lower initial annual sales volumes than our mature markets and overall wage inflation 
in addition  we experienced one time training costs related to our new menu board and burrito enhancement rollout of approximately  the menu board rollout was completed in the third quarter of fiscal another factor causing this increase was the higher electricity costs in the san diego area 
utility costs increased from the prior year 
the other areas contributing to the increase were occupancy  due to opening restaurants in higher profile areas  advertising  labor related and in repairs 
a substantial number of our employees are subject to various minimum wage requirements 
many of our employees work in restaurants located in california and receive salaries equal to or slightly greater than the california minimum wage 
on january   the california minimum wage was increased to per hour from 
on january   the california minimum wage is schedule to increase from to 
this increase may have a material impact on our results in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits related to the hiring of additional corporate employees and field management and other corporate level expenses required to support and manage unit and franchise expansion 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new units opened during and the new units opened during as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization increased to in versus in pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the increase in unit openings to in compared to in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening year over year remained approximately the same at  per unit 
loss on asset impairment 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of underperforming restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we currently do not plan to close any restaurants 
there was no impairment expense recorded in interest income expense  net 
net interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  in net interest income for the weeks ending december  interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the increase is primarily due to realizing a full twelve months of additional cash available for investing in fiscal after our initial public offering  which was completed in may in addition  interest expense declined to  in from  in this decrease is primarily due to the repayment of all long term debt in with the proceeds from our initial public offering 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book loss income 
the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of  for the tax rate applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax income of  for weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect a full weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the period ended december  results of operations also reflect a full weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the period ended december  revenue 
restaurant sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  this increase was principally due to the million in sales generated by a full year of operations from the units opened in which have been opened for less than months  combined with the million from the units opened during in addition  comparable unit sales increased million  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the comparable unit sales increase was primarily driven by  the success of the fish taco  tequila shrimp burrito  lobster burrito  and the crab and shrimp enchilada promotions  slightly weaker sales in the early part of due to poor weather and a price increase of approximately at the beginning of cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  primarily due to inefficiencies in our new markets 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other decreased as a percentage of sales to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the improvement as a percentage of sales is primarily a function of leveraging our fixed costs as our average unit volume increases 
the improvements in our fixed costs were slightly offset by an increase in labor 
this labor increase was due primarily to expected inefficiencies in the new stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits related to the hiring of additional corporate employees and field management required to support and manage unit expansion  as well as other corporate level expenses required to support and manage unit expansion 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new units opened during and the new units opened during as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization remained constant at of sales in both and pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the increase in unit openings to in compared to in in addition  we opened restaurants in four new markets 
the first store in a new market will typically have higher opening costs than a new store in an existing market 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  in net interest income for the weeks ending december  interest income increased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  due to an increase in cash available for investing after our may initial public offering 
in addition  interest expense declined to  in from  in as a result of the repayment of all long term debt with the proceeds from the may initial public offering 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in the weeks ended december  and december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
the tax rate applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate for the tax benefit applied to is primarily a result of the recognition of net deferred tax assets previously valued  due to the net income and the future realizability of such net deferred tax assets 
seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease and labor costs 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our capital requirements in recent years through cash flow from operations  private placement of preferred stock  bank debt  and the public sale of equity securities 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities for the weeks ended december  and million for the weeks ended december  the million increase is due to higher cash flow from operations on restaurants for a full year and restaurants for a partial year in compared to cash flows from operations on restaurants for a full year and restaurants for a partial year in net cash used in investing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to million for the weeks ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to sales and maturities of investments that were primarily used to fund our restaurant openings and our new menu board conversion in fiscal net cash generated from financing activities was  for the weeks ended december  compared to net cash provided of million for the weeks ended december  financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from exercises of common stock options  which generated  cash generated from financing activities in were primarily due to the initial public offering  which generated million net of offering costs 
offsetting the cash generated from the initial public offering were payments on our debt totaling million 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution that matures july  but as of december  there was no outstanding balance under this agreement 
interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus or on an adjusted libor plus per annum at december our funds are principally used for the development and opening of new units 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 
during the weeks ended december   we incurred million in capital expenditures  of which million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for corporate expenditures  for point of sale system upgrades and a company wide back office system roll out and for existing locations 
we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be invested in the opening of new restaurants 
we currently plan to open approximately units in and approximately units in we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  net of landlord allowances and excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant 
we lease restaurant and office facilities and real property under operating leases expiring through we have leased all of our facilities  except for one building  to minimize the cash investment associated with each unit 
the majority of our leases are for year terms and include options to extend the terms 
the majority of our leases also include fixed rate and percentage of sales rent provisions 
our future minimum lease payments for our headquarters and restaurants are expected to be as follows million in  million  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we believe that the anticipated cash flow from operations combined with funds anticipated to be available from a million credit facility and funds of approximately million remaining from our initial public offering will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
for additional information regarding our credit facility  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this report 
we plan to incur substantial costs over the near term in connection with our expansion program 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events my cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year and corporate bonds  mortgage and asset backed securities  commercial paper  tax free municipals  municipal bonds  us treasury notes and agencies with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution 
interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus  or an adjusted libor plus per annum at december  
however  there currently is no outstanding balance under this agreement 
should we draw on this line in the future  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense on these loans and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
