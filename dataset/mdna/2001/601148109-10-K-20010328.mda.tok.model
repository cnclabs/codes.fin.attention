on march   donald t 
difrancesco  the acting governor of new jersey  announced his support for the company s efforts to develop a mills project in the state of new jersey 
he added  however  that he was concerned that the proposed meadowlands mills project could have significant negative impacts on the wetlands areas within the meadowlands  and he noted other environmental concerns 
due to these concerns  he asked the company to withdraw its permit application for the existing site  but offered to work with the company to find a suitable alternative site in bergen county for the project 
the company believes that the proposed meadowlands mills project more than sufficiently mitigates the environmental impacts that would result from its development 
the company believes that there is strong support for the development of meadowlands mills in bergen county  and is continuing its efforts to secure the various permits and approvals required to commence construction at the existing location 
however  the company has accepted the acting governor s invitation to jointly explore alternative nearby sites having acceptable visibility and access 
these discussions are scheduled to begin in april of in addition to the above  the company is also conducting due diligence on several other proposed sites for its mills and block projects  including sites in cleveland  ohio  chicago  illinois  san francisco  california  boston  massachusetts  and tampa  florida

capital resources the company anticipates that its operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures and distributions to stockholders in accordance with reit requirements will be provided by cash generated from operations  potential ancillary land sales  future borrowings and possible sales of common and or preferred equity 
the company will need significant amounts of equity and debt capital to fund its development projects going forward 
access to capital is dependent upon many factors which are outside of the company s control 
in recent years  capital costs have increased requiring the company to re examine its development and financing strategies 
the company believes that it will have the capital and access to additional capital resources sufficient to expand and develop its business and complete those projects currently under development 
in the event such capital cannot be obtained  however  the company s immediate and long term development plans could be curtailed 
distributions the company has paid and intends to continue to pay regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders 
distributions are payable at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on a number of factors  including net cash provided by operating activities  its financial condition  capital commitments  debt repayment schedules and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
cash flows comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in distributions received from unconsolidated entities  proceeds received from the sale of community centers and was partially offset by an increase in expenditures for real estate and development assets 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to an increase in restricted cash and an increase in refinancing costs associated with the refinancing of sawgrass mills and the line of credit 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increase in inventory related to the company s retail operations 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of decreased expenditures for real estate and development assets 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the refinancing of ten community centers and the mezzanine loan related to sawgrass mills offset by decreased debt repayments in funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo a widely used and appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit which provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo as defined by national association of real estate investment trusts nareit means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company 
the company s method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including its ability to make distributions and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap for purposes of evaluating the company s operating performance 
ffo for the year ended december   increased to million compared to million for the comparable period in the following summary of the company s ffo and a reconciliation of net income before extraordinary items and minority interests to ffo is based on the nareit ffo definition for the periods presented years ended december  funds from operations calculation income before extraordinary item and minority interests    adjustments add depreciation and amortization of real estate assets    add real estate depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures    less gain on disposition of community centers  funds from operations    seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales peaking in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season 
as a result  a substantial portion of the percentage rents are not paid until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new lease up occurs towards the latter part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of the temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality also impacts the quarter by quarter results of net operating income and ffo  although this impact is largely mitigated by recognizing minimum rent on a straight line basis over the term of related leases in accordance with gaap 
economic trends because inflation has remained relatively low during the last three years  it has had little impact on the operation of the company during that period 
even in periods of higher inflation  however  tenant leases provide  in part  a mechanism to help protect the company 
as operating costs increase  leases permit a pass through of the common area maintenance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes and insurance  to the tenants 
furthermore  most of the leases contain base rent steps and percentage rent clauses that provide additional rent after a certain minimum sales level is achieved 
these provisions provide some protection to the company during highly inflationary periods
