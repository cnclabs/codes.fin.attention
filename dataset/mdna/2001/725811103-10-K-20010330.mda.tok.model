item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pixar was formed in when steve jobs purchased the computer division of lucasfilm and incorporated it as a separate company 
until  pixar generated its recurring revenue primarily from the license of renderman r software  software development contracts and fees for animated television commercials 
in  we entered into a feature film agreement the feature film agreement with walt disney pictures  a wholly owned subsidiary of the walt disney company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates collectively referred to herein as disney  for the development and production of up to three animated feature films to be marketed and distributed by disney 
as a result  in  we began to place more emphasis on products sold for their content  especially feature films  and the continued development of our proprietary software 
we reduced emphasis on the commercialization of software and contract development work and moved away from producing computer animated commercials 
this shift in focus resulted in a new business model  which we have implemented over the last eight years  where we develop and produce original animated feature films 
adoption of this new business model did not materially impact our results of operations and financial condition until  when we first recognized film revenue and cost of film revenue attributable to our first animated feature film  toy story  which was released in november our share of revenues and expenses from toy story was governed by the terms of the feature film agreement 
this agreement was superseded in february by the co production agreement  described below 
all films produced subsequent to toy story are subject to the terms of the co production agreement 
see business risk factors in item of this form k 
in february  we entered into the co production agreement co production agreement with disney pursuant to which we  on an exclusive basis  agreed to produce five original computer animated feature length theatrical motion pictures the pictures for distribution by disney 
pixar and disney agreed to co finance the production costs of the pictures  co own the pictures with disney having exclusive distribution and exploitation rights  co brand the pictures  and share equally in the profits of each picture and any related merchandise as well as other ancillary products  after recovery of all marketing and distribution costs which disney finances  a distribution fee paid to disney and any other fees or costs  including any participations provided to talent and the like 
the co production agreement generally provides that we will be responsible for the production of each picture  while disney will be responsible for the marketing  promotion  publicity  advertising and distribution of each picture 
our second feature film  a bug s life  was released in november and counts as the first original picture under the co production agreement 
the co production agreement also contemplates that with respect to theatrical sequels  made for home video sequels  television productions  interactive media products and other derivative works related to the pictures  we will have the opportunity to co finance and produce such products or to earn passive royalties on such products 
we will not share in any theme park revenues generated as a result of the pictures 
pursuant to the co production agreement  in addition to co financing the production costs of the pictures  disney will reimburse us for our share of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions 
see note of notes to financial statements 
in november  toy story  our third animated feature film was released 
as a sequel  toy story is a derivative work of the original toy story and therefore it does not count toward the five original pictures to be produced under the co production agreement 
however  as a derivative work  toy story is treated as a picture under the co production agreement  and all the provisions applicable to the five original pictures apply 
in  we began production on our fourth theatrical film  monsters  inc and concept development on our sixth animated feature film  film six 
in  we began production on our fifth animated feature film  finding nemo and concept development on our seventh animated feature film  film seven 
these films will be produced and distributed under the co production agreement and will count as the second  third  fourth  and fifth films of the five original films to be produced under the co production agreement 
we expect to release monsters  inc in november  and finding nemo in summer  at the earliest 
film six and film seven are currently targeted for release no earlier than and  respectively 
results of operations revenue in  we derived revenue from toy story  a bug s life  toy story  from software licenses and from fees for other animation services 
revenue from feature films is recognized as earned and reasonably estimable 
beginning in  we have had an improved ability  through information available to us from disney and other sources  to estimate and record our share of film revenues and gross profits 
under the co production agreement  we share equally with disney in the profits of toy story and a bug s life after disney recovers its marketing  distribution and other predefined costs and fees 
see business risk factors dependence on revenue from our feature films 
all payments to us from disney for development and production of toy story under the feature film agreement  and a bug s life  toy story  monsters  inc  finding nemo  film six  and film seven under the co production agreement have been recorded as cost reimbursements 
accordingly  no revenue has been recognized for such reimbursements  rather  we have netted the reimbursements against the related costs 
these reimbursed costs through the end of are set forth in note of notes to financial statements 
software license revenue is recognized upon shipment 
animation services revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
see note of notes to financial statements 
total revenue was million in  increased to million in  and increased to million in the increase in total revenue from to was due primarily to revenue recognized in generated by the release of a bug s life in november no revenues attributable to toy story were recognized in the increase in total revenue from to was due primarily to revenue recognized in generated by the release of toy story in november film and animation services revenue increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in film revenue increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in film revenue in was derived primarily from residual merchandise sales from toy story under the feature film agreement 
the increase in resulted primarily from a bug s life theatrical  home video and merchandise revenues  offset by disney s related distribution costs and fees 
the significant increase from to was primarily due to the tremendous success of toy story in both theatrical and home video markets 
revenues for were also derived from our library titles  and additional revenues related to the toy story franchise  including royalties from the direct to video release of buzz lightyear of star command  and royalties from the buzz lightyear of star command television series 
animation services revenue includes revenue generated from short projects related to our feature films 
fees for animation services  which are fixed in advance  depend on the relative complexity and length of each production and may also depend on the market and other competitive conditions 
animation services revenue increased from  in to  in  and remained relatively flat at  in we expect that revenue in this area will continue to vary significantly from year to year due to the sporadic nature of this business and the need to utilize animation services employees on other productions 
for example  we transferred substantially all of our animation services employees to assist in the completion of both a bug s life and toy story during peak production periods 
there can be no assurance that we will generate any animation services revenue during periods in which animation services employees are devoted to feature films or other projects 
software revenue includes software license revenue  principally from renderman r  and royalty revenue from licensing physical effects  inc pei technology to a third party 
software revenue increased from million in to million in  and increased to million in software revenue increased in both years due primarily to an increase in renderman r software license revenue  and to a lesser extent  from an increase in the royalty revenue from licensing pei technology to a third party 
pei  a company we acquired in  licensed certain of its technology to a third party  from which we now receive associated royalty revenue on a quarterly basis 
in spite of the increase in software revenue for the year  our primary focus is on content creation for animated feature films and related products  and as a result  we have not increased the time and resources necessary to generate significantly higher renderman r license revenues 
therefore  we continue to expect ongoing variability in revenue derived from software licenses and that such revenue will remain flat or possibly decline 
all historical and future royalty income  if any  associated with our discontinued cd rom division is now and will continue to be excluded from software revenue and presented in results of discontinued operations 
see results of discontinued operations 
for fiscal years and  disney accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue from continuing operations  attributable to film related revenue  animation services and software revenue 
for fiscal year  disney accounted for of our revenue from continuing operations  primarily attributable to revenue generated from the theatrical and home video release of toy story  and related merchandise 
cost of revenue cost of film and animation services revenue increased to million in from  in  and increased to million in cost of film revenue represents amortization of capitalized film costs 
higher than expected toy story film revenue in prior years resulted in our amortizing all toy story film costs by december  as a result  there was no cost of film revenue for toy story in  only cost of animation services revenue 
cost of film revenue for fiscal year included amortization of capitalized film costs associated with a bug s life  and represented of total film revenue 
cost of film revenue for fiscal year included amortization of capitalized film costs associated with a bug s life and toy story  and represented of total film revenue 
the decline in cost of film revenue as a percentage of total film revenue in from can be attributed to revenue related to toy story for which there was no corresponding cost  as well as a lower amortization percentage for toy story relative to a bug s life due to its success in the marketplace 
cost of animation services revenue consists of production costs  which include salaries  benefits  facility expenses  and department overhead costs 
cost of animation services revenue as a percentage of the related revenue increased from in to in  and decreased slightly to in in  we decided to largely discontinue our business of producing a number of animated television commercials  in favor of working on a fewer number of animation services projects related to our feature films 
the variation in gross profit reflects the fact that animation services projects are negotiated individually and depending on the complexity of the project  profit margins may vary significantly from project to project 
cost of software revenue consists of the direct cost and manufacturing overhead required to reproduce and to package our software products  as well as amortization of purchased technology 
cost of software revenue includes no amortization of internal software development expenses since no such expenses have been capitalized 
cost of software revenue as a percentage of the related revenue decreased from in to in  and decreased further to in cost of software revenue in all three years was due primarily to the amortization of purchased technology associated with the acquisition of physical effects  inc pei 
approximately million of the pei purchase price was assigned to purchased technology  which pei licensed to a third party 
as a result of the ongoing amortization of this purchased technology  it is likely that our software gross profit will vary from year to year as compared to software gross profit prior to the acquisition 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in  and to million in we intend to continue to increase operating expenses in a number of areas 
with respect to general expense growth  as a result of competition we have had to pay higher salaries for technical and administrative personnel 
we expect compensation for such personnel to continue to increase 
despite the flat year over year comparison in operating expenses from to  we still expect future operating expenses to reflect the growth of the studio as we prepare for the release of monsters  inc and as we ramp up toward our goal of producing one feature film per year 
under the co production agreement  disney reimburses us for half of certain general and administrative costs and certain research and development costs that benefit the productions 
the funding received from disney is treated as operating expense reimbursements 
see note of notes to financial statements 
to the extent that personnel  facilities and other expenditures are not capitalized by us nor allocated to and paid for by disney  and precede or are not subsequently followed by an increase in revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation for the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair value of our common stock for options granted during amortization of deferred compensation of  and  was expensed in and  respectively 
as of january   all deferred compensation has been amortized 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and support for personnel conducting research and development for the renderman r product  for our proprietary marionette tm and ringmaster tm animation and production management software 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in due to our increased investment in creative development  an increase in employee related costs associated with the release of toy story and increased investment in proprietary technology and short film projects in research and development expenses declined to million due primarily to diverting personnel and other resources to the current productions and a decrease in employee costs related to toy story  which were reflected in in addition  there was a decrease in costs associated with the short film projects resulting from a one time  additional reimbursement from disney under the co production agreement for certain research and development expenses incurred prior to fiscal year we expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods due to our continued investment in internal technology 
to date  all research and development costs not reimbursed by disney have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and overhead  as well as public relations  advertising  technical support and trade show costs required to support the software segment 
in and  sales and marketing expenses increased to million and million  respectively  from million in primarily due to increases in corporate marketing and public relations costs  as well as to sales expenses associated with an increase in software license revenues 
we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods  particularly in the areas of public relations and corporate marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of management and administrative personnel  insurance costs and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses remained level at million in and  and increased to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to increased general and administrative headcount and related compensation  costs necessary to support our infrastructure and public company related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to further increase in future periods 
other income  net other income  net was million in  million in  and million in other income  net consisted primarily of interest income from investments 
the decrease from to was due to an average decline in cash balances in the first half of as cash was being used to fund film production and the construction of our new emeryville facility 
the increase from to is primarily due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances during the year 
income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations of million  million and million reflects our effective tax rates of  and for   and  respectively 
due to the increase in earnings and the use of all net operating loss carryforwards by the first quarter of  income tax expense has increased significantly 
we expect that our effective tax rate will be reduced in the near future due to the utilization of research and experimentation credits for federal and state tax purposes  as well as the utilization of certain other state credits and exemptions 
see note of notes to financial statements 
results of discontinued operations after the co production agreement was executed  we determined that  despite the fact that our first cd rom titles were successful on relative terms  the resources devoted to our interactive products division would be better allocated to other projects arising from the co production agreement 
we determined in march to discontinue our business of producing cd rom and other interactive products and redirected the approximately employees in that division to film and related projects within pixar 
we recorded income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  in   in and  in due to royalty income received 
although income from discontinued operations for increased  we do not expect to receive significant cd rom royalty income in future periods 
see note of notes to financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and short term investments increased from million at january  to million at december  the increase was due primarily to cash received from disney for our share of film revenue  as well as software revenue and interest income 
this increase was partially offset by film production spending and construction expenditures on our new studio and headquarter facilities in emeryville  california 
in  cash provided by operating activities largely consisted of net income of million  primarily resulting from film revenue related to toy story 
in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of million primarily resulting from film revenue related to a bug s life  the non cash impact of deferred income taxes and tax benefit from option exercises of million  and the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs  totaling million 
in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of million resulting primarily from film revenue related to toy story  cash provided by unearned revenue totaling million  the non cash impact of deferred income taxes and tax benefit from option exercises of million  and the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of capitalized film production costs  totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities for was partially offset by receivables from disney of million 
in  and cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of investments in short term securities  capitalized film production costs and purchase of property and equipment  as described below  offset by net proceeds from sales of short term investments 
in  and  cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from exercised stock options 
at december   our capital commitments primarily consisted of obligations to fund production costs of films and derivative products under the co production agreement and additional remaining costs related to our new studio and headquarter facilities  both discussed below 
we also have obligations to pay portions of any revenue derived from each feature film produced under the co production agreement to our entertainment law firm in consideration for services rendered and we have obligations under operating leases 
see note of notes to financial statements 
we expect cash expenditures for capital equipment to be approximately million  excluding costs related to our new studio and headquarter facilities discussed below 
film production costs under co production agreement 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million  net of disney s film cost reimbursements  on direct film costs and other costs to fund our ongoing film projects under the co production agreement  which will directly impact working capital 
however  there can be no assurance that such costs would not change based on revised estimates 
new studio and headquarter facilities 
in november  we moved our offices from leased facilities in richmond  california to our new headquarters and studio facility in emeryville  california 
as of december   we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million to purchase the land and to construct our studio and headquarter facility 
in order to complete construction and furnish and equip our emeryville facility  we expect to incur capital expenditures ranging from million to million in on march   we purchased an existing building on acres in emeryville for million 
while it was purchased for potential future expansion  the building will serve as a rental property  is occupied by commercial tenants and is expected to generate rental income 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
pursuant to the co production agreement  we will co finance the next four original animated feature films  which we produce  including monsters  inc  finding nemo  film six and film seven 
in the future  we may co finance other derivative works such as theatrical sequels  direct to home video sequels  interactive products and television productions 
we believe that our current available funds and forecasted cash from operations in will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures  including the production costs of monsters  inc  finding nemo  film six and film seven 
however  there can be no assurance that current and forecasted cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations 
to date  we have chosen to use our existing cash resources to fund both facility construction costs and film production costs 
we may continue to use our cash resources for such expenditures  or may choose to finance such capital expenditures through issuance of additional equity or debt securities  by obtaining a credit facility or by some other financing mechanism

we invest in a variety of investment grade  interest bearing securities  including fixed rate obligations of corporations  and national governmental entities and agencies 
this diversification of risk is consistent with our policy to ensure safety of our principal and maintain liquidity 
we only invest in securities with a maturity of months or less  with only government obligations exceeding months 
our investments are fixed rate obligations and carry a certain degree of interest rate risk 
a rise in interest rates could adversely impact the fair market value of these securities 
all of our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading and are considered available for sale per sfas the table below provides information regarding our investment portfolio at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates presented by expected maturity date dollars in thousands less than over year year total available for sale securities    weighted average interest rate impact of foreign currency rate changes 
while our products are distributed in foreign markets by disney and its affiliates  we are not directly exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
however  we recognize revenues from foreign territories based on an average foreign currency exchange rate used by disney for revenue reporting 
this rate may differ from the actual exchange rate at the time cash is remitted to disney and subsequently to us 
therefore  there may be some indirect foreign currency exchange rate exposure as managed by disney
