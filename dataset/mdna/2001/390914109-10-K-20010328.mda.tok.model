prior to  we originated arms that were indexed to the federal home loan bank s eleventh district cost of funds index  sometimes referred to as cofi

a loan underwriter analyzes the merits of the loan based upon information obtained relative to the borrower and property eg  income  credit history  assets  liabilities  cash flows  and the value of the real property as stated on the appraisal report 
loans are then approved at various levels of authority depending upon the amount and type of loan 
the majority of real estate loans held in our portfolio are secured by properties located in northern california 
we require the american land title association form of title insurance on all loans secured by real property and require that fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts sufficient to rebuild or replace the improvements at current replacement costs be maintained on all properties securing the loans 
in addition  we require flood insurance for properties in flood hazard zones to protect the property securing our interest 
consistent with regional industry practices  we do not necessarily require earthquake insurance as part of our general underwriting practices

competition the banking and financial services industry in general  and specifically in california and the san francisco bay area  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  including the financial services modernization act  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we compete for loans and leases  deposits  and customers with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  securities and brokerage companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions  and other nonbank financial services providers 
many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization  have greater access to existing and newly emerging capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than bay view bank 
in addition  recent federal legislation may have the effect of further increasing the pace of consolidation within the financial services industry 
in order to compete with other financial services providers  we principally rely upon local promotional activities  personal relationships with our customers  and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served 
in those instances when we are unable to accommodate a customer s needs  we may arrange for those services to be provided by our correspondents 
bay view bank has branch offices located in the following san francisco bay area counties san francisco  san mateo  santa clara  marin  contra costa  alameda  sonoma  solano  and santa cruz 
in addition  we operate various lending facilities through a nationwide network of loan production offices 
economic conditions  government policies and legislation our profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rates we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on our interest earning assets  such as loans  leases and securities  comprises a significant portion of our earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession and unemployment and the impact of future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions that we cannot predict 
our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the board of governors of the federal reserve system  sometimes referred to as the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies  with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession  through its open market operations in us government securities by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and by varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  leases  investments  and deposits  and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we cannot predict the nature or impact on us of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
from time to time  legislation is enacted  and regulations are adopted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between financial services providers 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of national banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in the us congress  in the state legislatures and by various regulatory agencies 
we cannot predict the likelihood of any legislative or regulatory changes or the impact that these changes might have on us
