fitness equipment revenues increased as a result of new product introductions and higher sales to health clubs 
international sales increased percent to million in  an increase of million over sales to europe increased percent to million in versus million in  reflecting stronger sales of fitness equipment and boats  which offset some softness experienced in sales of marine engine products 
the company s sales to the pacific rim increased percent to million in from million in  primarily due to stronger sales of marine engine products 
these favorable results were partially offset by a decline in sales to africa and the middle east resulting from lower sales of marine engine products and the effects of unfavorable currency fluctuations 
marine engine product sales comprised the largest share of international sales in the company s gross margin percentage held constant at percent in and  as benefits were received from cost reductions  an improved sales mix and increased production volumes 
these benefits helped to mitigate the unfavorable currency effects resulting from the sale of products that are manufactured in the united states and sold into certain foreign markets  primarily europe and australia 
gross margin percentages increased to percent in from percent in the basis point improvement in gross margin was principally due to the benefits received from additional sales of larger  higher margin boats and from margin gains in the bowling business attributable to strategic actions taken in late these factors more than offset the unfavorable effect of a sales mix shift to low emission outboard engines 
in  the company s selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were percent of net sales versus percent in the significant improvement resulted from overall sales growth  as well as successful cost containment efforts  especially in the boat and marine engine segments and the bowling business 
also contributing to this improvement was better pension plan performance and decreased legal expenses in  as well as spending on year activities incurred in  but not repeated in sg a expense increased percent to million in versus million in sg a expense in included income of million related to a settlement with a boat dealer

the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates on the company s borrowings 
the company s net exposure to interest rate risk primarily consists of fixed rate instruments 
interest rate risk management is accomplished through the use of interest rate swaps and floating rate instruments that are benchmarked to us and european short term money market interest rates 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials 
the company uses a value at risk var computation to estimate the maximum one day reduction in pretax earnings related to its foreign currency  interest rate and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
the var computation includes the company s debt  foreign currency forwards  interest rate swap agreements and commodity swap agreements 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company could incur on its derivative financial instruments from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates or commodity prices using the var estimation model 
the var model uses the variance covariance statistical modeling technique and uses historical foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates and prices in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques and includes substantially all market risk exposures 
the estimated potential losses shown in the table below have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
amount in time confidence risk category millions period level foreign exchange day interest rates day commodity prices day the percent confidence level signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown disregard the possibility that foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices could move in the company s favor 
the var model assumes that all movements in rates and commodity prices will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  since actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in global financial markets
