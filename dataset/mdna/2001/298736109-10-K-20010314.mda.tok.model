impact of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted sfas the company is required to adopt statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
for us gaap reporting as of january sfas and establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 entities are required to carry all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for movements in fair value of derivatives depends upon whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  the company may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  movements in fair value are recognized in earnings with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the movement in fair value of the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted transaction impacts earnings 
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of movements in fair value of the derivative instrument are reported in earnings in the current period 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  movements in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized in earnings 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the method that the company will use to assess effectiveness of a hedge  as well as the measurement approach for determining the ineffectiveness of a hedge  must be established at the inception of a hedge 
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for entering into the transaction 
this process includes linking derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets  liabilities or firm commitments on forecasted transactions 
this process is repeated on a periodic basis 
if at any time the company determines a hedge is no longer effective  hedge accounting is immediately discontinued and the derivative is marked to market with any gain or loss recorded in earnings 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january and this had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as the company does not have any derivative financial instruments 
future changes in the fair value for any remaining trading securities will be recorded through earnings 
changes in fair value of available for sale securities will be recorded in other comprehensive income

forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document  including  without limitation  statements regarding i the company s business plans and financing plans and requirements  ii trends affecting the company s business plans and financing plans and requirements  ii trends affecting the company s business  v the adequacy of capital to meet the company s capital requirements and expansion plans  vi the assumptions underlying the company s business plans  vii business strategy  viii government regulatory action  ix technological advances and x projected costs and revenues  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may materially differ from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including technological and business developments in the local card and electronic banking markets affecting the transaction and other fees which the company is able to charge for its services  foreign exchange fluctuations  competition from bank owned atm networks  outsource providers of atm services and software providers  the company s relationships with its major customers  sponsor banks in various markets and international card organization  and changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business 
these risks  and other risks are described elsewhere in this document and the company s periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange exposure in  of the company s revenues were generated in poland and hungary  as compared to in and in the figure has increased due to the increase in revenues for the polish operations 
in hungary the majority of revenues received are denominated in hungarian forint and in poland  the majority of revenues are denominated in polish zloty 
however the majority of these foreign currency denominated contracts are linked either to inflation or the retail price index 
while it remains the case that a significant portion of the company s expenditures are made in or are denominated in us dollars the company is also striving to achieve more of its expenses in local currencies to match its revenues 
the company estimates that a further depreciation in foreign exchange rates of the deutsche mark  hungarian forint  polish zloty and the british pound sterling against the us dollar  would have the combined effect of a million decrease in the reported net loss 
this was estimated using of the company s net losses after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items including us dollar denominated or indexed expenses 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or the company s financing or operating strategies 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the deutsche mark  as opposed to the us dollar  on the central european currencies  the company expects that the currencies of the markets where it invests will fluctuate less against the deutsche mark than against the dollar 
accordingly  the company believes that its deutsche mark denominated debt provides  in the medium to long term  for a closer matching of assets and liabilities than would dollar denominated debt 
inflation and functional currencies in recent years  hungary  poland and the czech republic have experienced high levels of inflation 
consequently  these countries currencies have continued to decline in value against the major currencies of the oecd over this time period 
however  due to the significant reduction in the inflation rate of these countries in recent years  none of these countries are considered to have a hyper inflationary economy 
further  the majority of all three subsidiaries revenues are denominated in the local currency 
thus all three subsidiaries use their local currency as the functional currency 
the polish and czech subsidiaries changed their functional currency to the respective local currency as of january  and january   respectively  and the hungarian subsidiary changed as of july  germany  france and the united kingdom have experienced relatively low and stable inflation rates in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia  like germany and france  has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of the croatian company is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to the factors mentioned above  the company does not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company continually reviews inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries that it operates in
