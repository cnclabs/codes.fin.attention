item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
general the company has only one subsidiary  sbm 
the bank s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank also generates noninterest income primarily from fees charged on customers accounts and fees earned on activities such as investment services provided through a third party registered broker dealer 
gains on the sales of securities is another source of noninterest income 
the bank s noninterest expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy expense  advertising and other operating expenses 
the bank s results of operations are also affected by general economic and competitive conditions  notably changes in market interest rates  government policies and regulations 
sbm exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at december  pending acquisition on february   the bank and first federal entered in an agreement under which the bank will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of first federal for cash equal to approximately million 
immediately after the completion of the acquisition  first federal will be merged into sbm 
the board of directors of the company expects the transaction to close in the third quarter of the transaction is subject to approval by first federal shareholders and federal and state regulatory agencies 
under certain circumstances  if the agreement is terminated by the bank for the reasons set forth in the agreement before the consummation of the merger  first federal may be required to pay the bank cash of million plus out of pocket expenses 
operating strategy the bank is an independent  community oriented savings bank  delivering quality customer service and offering a wide range of deposit  loan and investment products to its customers 
in recent years  the bank s strategy has been to enhance profitability by emphasizing the origination of commercial real estate and business loans  increasing sources of noninterest income and by improving operating efficiencies while managing its capital position and limiting its credit and interest rate risk exposure 
to accomplish these objectives  the bank has sought to 
operate as a full service community bank

control credit risk by focusing on the origination of single family  owner occupied residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  consisting primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit 

monitor and control interest rate risk primarily by selling longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  by investing in shorter term mortgage backed securities and by selectively using off balance sheet hedging transactions 

invest funds in excess of loan demand primarily in mortgage backed securities  investment grade debt and equity mutual funds 

invest in technological enhancements to increase productivity and efficiency 
comparison of financial condition at december  and total assets increased million  or  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the increase was due primarily to a million increase in securities  a million increase in the loan portfolio  and a million increase in cash and cash equivalents of which million of the increase was in short term investments 
the growth in assets was funded primarily by the net proceeds from the company s public offering in march  and increases in deposits of million  federal home loan bank advances of million  and short term borrowed funds of million

due to the timing of the conversion  earnings per share for the twelve months ended december  and prior periods are not presented 
earnings per diluted share were for the ten months ended december  operating earnings  which exclude securities gains and the previously discussed expense of million net of related tax effect  were significantly higher than the prior year s levels 
operating earnings  net of tax  for the year ended december  were million  a million  or  increase compared to million for the year ended december  net interest income after provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million for compared to million for service charges and fees and other noninterest income increased million  or  from million for to million for noninterest expense  excluding the foundation expense of million in  increased million  or  to million for from million for net interest income

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for the allowance for loan losses was of total loans and of nonperforming loans at december  compared to and  respectively  at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans is primarily due to the full repayment of a nonperforming commercial real estate loan for million during april the bank s management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon management s continuing analysis of the quality of the loan portfolio 
while management believes that  based on information currently available  the bank s allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio at this time  no assurances can be given that the bank s level of allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover loan losses incurred by the bank or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses 
management may increase its level of allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans and nonperforming loans if the level of commercial  multi family  construction or consumer lending as a percentage of total loan portfolio increases 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to provide additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  or  to million for as compared to million for fee income from service charges and account fees was million in compared to million for the increase in fee income and service charges is primarily due to the introduction of debit cards and increases in merchant services and individual account fees

the decline was due to the combined effect of decreased securities gains and reduced gains from the sale of mortgages to the secondary market 
the decline in securities gains is due to the gains realized in relating to the formation of savings bank of manchester foundation  inc and the contribution of appreciated securities to the foundation

the bank further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities  paydowns  and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank s primary investing activities are originating residential one to four family mortgage loans and  to a lesser extent  commercial business and real estate loans  multi family loans  single family construction loans  home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans and investing in mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  us government and agency obligations  corporate equity securities and debt obligations 
these activities are funded primarily by proceeds from the public offering  principal and interest payments on loans  maturities of securities  deposit growth and federal home loan bank of boston advances 
the company received net proceeds after expenses from the issuance of stock in connection with the conversion of million 
the company used of the net proceeds from the conversion to buy all of the common stock of sbm and retained the remaining  which amount was primarily invested in fixed income securities 
during the years ended december  and  the bank purchased and originated loans totaling million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  the bank purchased mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  us government and agency obligations  corporate equity securities and debt obligations of million and million  respectively 
the bank experienced a net increase in total deposits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily as a result of retail and commercial programs designed to attract deposits 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by the bank and its local competitors and other factors 
principal payments on loans  maturities of securities  and net federal home loan bank advances were million  million  and million  respectively  for the year ended december  principal payments on loans  maturities of securities  and net federal home loan bank advances were million  million  and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
if the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through federal home loan bank advances and through repurchase agreement borrowing facilities 
outstanding commitments for all loans and unadvanced construction loans and lines of credit totalled million at december  management of the bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totalled million 
the bank relies primarily on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
occasionally  the bank will also offer special competitive promotions to its customers to increase retention and promote deposit growth 
based upon the bank s historical experience with deposit retention  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
sbm must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   sbm exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with leverage capital of million  or of average assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
sbm is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
on february   the bank and first federal entered into a definitive agreement under which the bank would acquire all of the outstanding common stock of first federal for cash equal to approximately million 
immediately after the completion of the acquisition  first federal will be merged into sbm 
the board of directors of the company expects the transaction to close in the third quarter of the transaction is subject to approval by first federal shareholders and federal and state regulatory agencies 
management expects the effect of the transaction on the liquidity and capital of the bank to be significant 
management will continue to plan for and monitor the liquidity and capital of the bank as the transaction closing date draws nearer 
management is considering several options to fund the acquisition 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative aspects of market risk the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the principal objectives of the bank s interest rate risk management are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet account  determine the level of risk appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with its established policies 
the bank has an asset liability committee  responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the executive committee of the board of directors and the board of directors 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the bank 
in recent years  the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and selling longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  originating variable rate commercial real estate loans and prime rate commercial business loans  emphasizing shorter term consumer loans including home equity lines of credit indexed to the prime rate  as reported in the wall street journal  maintaining a high quality securities portfolio that provides adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity and duration of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan portfolio  promoting lower cost liability accounts such as demand deposits and business repurchase accounts  and using federal home loan bank advances to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
sbm s market risk also includes equity price risk 
sbm s marketable equity securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million at december  which are included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of the sbm s capital 
if equity security prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  sbm s capital would decrease 
the bank s investment policy authorizes it to be a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include interest rate cap agreements 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve the payment of a premium in return for cash receipts if interest rates rise above or fall below a specified interest rate level 
payments are based on a notional principal amount 
caps generally are not readily available for time periods longer than five years 
the bank s objective in using interest rate caps is to reduce risk associated with adverse rate volatility while enabling the bank to benefit from favorable interest rate movements 
all counter parties to cap arrangements must be preapproved by the bank s executive committee and reported to its investment committee 
at december   the bank had no derivative instruments 
quantitative aspects of market risk the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
at december   the bank s one year gap position  the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  was 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a positive gap position would be in a better position to invest in higher yielding assets which  consequently  may result in the yield on its assets increasing at a pace more closely matching the increase in the cost of its interest bearing liabilities than if it had a negative gap 
during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a positive gap would tend to have its assets repricing at a faster rate than one with a negative gap which  consequently  may tend to restrain the growth of  or reduce  its net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the bank  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a series of time intervals 
for residential adjustable rate  and fixed rate loans  prepayment rates were assumed to range from to annually 
mortgage backed securities were assumed to prepay at a rate of annually 
investment securities  which include callable federal agency obligations  are presented based on stated maturities 
money market accounts were assumed to reprice at    and  respectively  for each of the following periods one year  one to two years  two to three years  three to five years  and over five years 
savings accounts were assumed to reprice at    and  respectively  for each of the following periods one year  one to two years  two to three years  three to five years  and over five years 
now accounts were assumed to reprice at     and  respectively  for each of the following periods one year  one to two years  two to three years  three to five years  and over five years 
short term borrowed funds were assumed to reprice at     and  respectively  for each of the following periods one year  one to two years  two to three years  three to five years  and over five years 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the bank s estimated gap 
while the bank believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and repricing rates will approximate actual future loan repayment and deposit withdrawal activity

as of december   the bank s estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve and twenty four month periods is as follows percentage change in estimated net interest income over months months basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates based on the scenario above  net income would be adversely affected within the bank s internal guidelines in both the twelve and twenty four month periods in a declining rate environment and positively affected within the bank s internal guidelines in both the twelve and twenty four month periods in a rising rate environment 
for each percentage point change in net interest income  the effect on net income would be  assuming a tax rate
