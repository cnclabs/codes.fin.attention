item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on april   constellation energy r group  inc constellation energy became the holding company for baltimore gas and electric company bge r and constellation r enterprises  inc constellation enterprises was previously owned by bge 
this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
reference in this report to the utility business is to bge 
constellation energy s subsidiaries primarily include a domestic merchant energy business focused mostly on power marketing and merchant generation in north america  and bge 
we realigned our organization in response to the deregulation of electric generation in maryland 
in the first quarter of  we combined our wholesale power marketing operation with our domestic plant development and operation activities to form a domestic merchant energy business 
at the same time  we revised our operating segments to reflect those realignments as presented in note on july   as a result of the deregulation of electric generation  bge transferred its generating assets and related liabilities at book value to new nonregulated subsidiaries calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc and constellation power source generation  inc we discuss the deregulation of electric generation in the current issues electric competition section 
effective july   we formed a nonregulated holding company  constellation power source holdings  inc  that oversees 
the wholesale power marketing and risk management activities of constellation power source  tm inc  
the domestic power projects of constellation investments  tm inc and constellation power  tm inc  and subsidiaries  and 
the generating assets of constellation power source generation  inc as a result of these changes  our domestic merchant energy business includes the operations of constellation power source holdings  the nuclear generation of calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc  and the nuclear consulting services of constellation nuclear  tm llc 
also  effective july   the financial results of the electric generation portion of our business are included in the domestic merchant energy business 
prior to that date  the financial results of electric generation were included in bge s regulated electric business 
bge remains a regulated electric and gas public utility distribution company with a service territory in the city of baltimore and all or part of ten counties in central maryland 
our other nonregulated businesses include the 
latin american power projects of constellation power  and subsidiaries  
energy products and services of constellation energy source  tm inc  
home products  commercial building systems  and residential and commercial electric and gas retail marketing of bge home products services  tm inc and subsidiaries  
general partnership  in which bge is a partner  of district chilled water general partnership comfortlink r that provides cooling services for commercial customers in baltimore  
financial investments of constellation investments  and 
real estate holdings and senior living facilities of constellation real estate group  tm inc as discussed further in the strategy section  on october   we announced initiatives to separate our domestic merchant energy business from our remaining businesses 
these remaining businesses include bge and the other nonregulated businesses described above 
in this discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including 
what factors affect our businesses  
what our earnings and costs were in and  
why our earnings and costs changed from the year before  
where our earnings come from  
how all of this affects our overall financial condition  
what our expenditures for capital projects were for through  and what we expect them to be through  and 
where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods by operating segment 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investments in constellation energy and or bge 
also  this discussion and analysis is based on the operation of the electric generation portion of our utility business under rate regulation through june  our regulated electric business changed as we transferred our electric generation assets and related liabilities to our domestic merchant energy business and we entered into retail customer choice for electric generation effective july  in addition  we announced our intention to separate our domestic merchant energy business from our remaining businesses 
accordingly  the results of operations and financial condition described in this discussion and analysis are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
strategy customer choice and regulatory change significantly impact our business 
in response to these  we regularly evaluate our strategies with two goals in mind to improve our competitive position  and to anticipate and adapt to regulatory change 
prior to july   the majority of our earnings were from bge 
going forward  prior to separating into two companies  we expect to derive almost two thirds of our earnings from our domestic merchant energy business 
while bge continues to be regulated and to deliver electricity and natural gas through its core distribution business  our primary growth strategies center on the nonregulated domestic merchant energy business with the objective of providing new sources of earnings growth 
on october   we announced three initiatives to advance our growth strategies 
the first initiative is that we entered into an agreement the agreement with an affiliate of the goldman sachs group  inc goldman sachs 
under the terms of the agreement  goldman sachs will acquire up to a equity interest in our domestic merchant energy business  which will be consolidated under a single holding company holdco 
goldman sachs will also acquire a ten year warrant for up to of holdco s common stock subject to certain adjustments 
the warrant is exercisable six months after holdco s common stock becomes publicly available 
the amount of common stock which goldman sachs may receive upon exercise will be equal to the excess of the market price of holdco s common stock at the time of exercise over the exercise price of per share for all the stock subject to the warrant  divided by the market price 
holdco may at its option pay goldman sachs such excess in cash 
goldman sachs is acquiring its interest and the warrant in exchange for million in cash subject to adjustment in certain instances and certain assets related to our power marketing operation 
at closing  goldman sachs existing services agreement with our power marketing operation will terminate 
the second initiative is a plan to separate our domestic merchant energy business from our remaining businesses as discussed in the introduction 
the separation will create two stand alone  publicly traded energy companies 
one will be a merchant energy business engaged in wholesale power marketing and generation under the name constellation energy group after the separation 
the other will be a regional retail energy delivery and energy services company  bge corp  which will include bge  our other nonregulated businesses  and our investment in orion power holdings  inc orion 
as a result of the separation  shareholders will continue to own all of constellation energy s current businesses through their ownership of the stock of the new constellation energy group and of bge corp 
the third initiative is a change in our common stock dividend policy effective april in a move closely aligned with our separation plan  effective april  our annual dividend is expected to be set at 
per share 
after the separation  bge corp 
expects to pay initial annual dividends of 
per share 
constellation energy group  as a growing merchant energy company  initially expects to reinvest its earnings in order to fund its growth plans and not to pay a dividend 
the closing of the transaction with goldman sachs and the separation are subject to customary closing conditions and contingent upon obtaining regulatory approvals and a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service regarding certain tax matters 
the transaction and separation are expected to be completed by mid to late at the date of this report  we received approval from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
we discuss these strategic initiatives further in our report on form k and exhibits filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on october  currently  our domestic merchant energy business controls over  megawatts of generation 
in december  we announced that a subsidiary of constellation nuclear will purchase  megawatts of the  megawatts total generating capacity of the nine mile point nuclear power plant located in scriba  new york 
the total purchase price  including fuel  is million 
we discuss the planned acquisition of the nine mile point power plant in more detail in note we also are constructing generating facilities representing  megawatts of natural gas fired peaking capacity in the mid atlantic and mid west regions which are expected to be operational by the summer of an additional  megawatts of natural gas fired peaking and combined cycle production facilities in various regions of north america are scheduled for completion in and beyond 
by  our domestic merchant energy business expects to control approximately  megawatts through the construction or purchase of additional nuclear and non nuclear generation assets and through contractual arrangements 
we decided to exit the latin american portion of our operation as a result of our concentration on domestic merchant energy 
currently  we are actively seeking a buyer for the latin american portion of our business and are working toward completing our exit strategy in we also might consider one or more of the following strategies 
the complete or partial separation of our transmission and distribution functions  
mergers or acquisitions of utility or non utility businesses  and 
sale of generation assets or one or more businesses 
current issues with the shift toward customer choice  competition  and the growth of our domestic merchant energy business  various factors will affect our financial results in the future 
these factors include  but are not limited to  operating our generation assets in a deregulated market without the benefit of a fuel rate adjustment clause  the timing and implications of deregulation in other regions where our domestic merchant energy business will operate  the loss of revenues due to customers choosing alternative suppliers  higher volatility of earnings and cash flows  and increased financial requirements of our domestic merchant energy business 
please refer to the forward looking statements section for additional factors 
in this section  we discuss in more detail several issues that affect our businesses 
electric competition we are facing electric competition on various fronts  including 
the construction of generating units to meet increased demand for electricity  
the sale of electricity in wholesale power markets  
competing with alternative energy suppliers  and 
electric sales to retail customers 
maryland on april   maryland enacted the electric customer choice and competition act of the act and accompanying tax legislation that significantly restructured maryland s electric utility industry and modified the industry s tax structure 
in the restructuring order discussed below  the maryland public service commission maryland psc addressed the major provisions of the act 
the accompanying tax legislation is discussed in detail in note on november   the maryland psc issued a restructuring order that resolved the major issues surrounding electric restructuring  accelerated the timetable for customer choice  and addressed the major provisions of the act 
the restructuring order also resolved the electric restructuring proceeding transition costs  customer price protections  and unbundled rates for electric services and a petition filed in september by the office of people s counsel opc to lower our electric base rates 
the major provisions of the restructuring order are discussed in note we believe that the restructuring order provided sufficient details of the transition plan to competition for bge s electric generation business to require bge to discontinue the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation for that portion of its business 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of fasb statement no 
and emerging issues task force consensus eitf no 
 deregulation of the pricing of electricity issues related to the application of fasb statements no 
and for bge s electric generation business 
bge s transmission and distribution business continues to meet the requirements of sfas no 
as that business remains regulated 
we describe the effect of applying these accounting requirements in note please refer to note for a discussion regarding appeals of the restructuring order 
as a result of the deregulation of electric generation  the following occurred effective july  
all customers  except a few commercial and industrial companies that have signed contracts with bge  can choose their electric energy supplier 
bge will provide a standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative supplier 
in either case  bge will continue to deliver electricity to all customers in areas traditionally served by bge 

bge reduced residential base rates by approximately  on average about million a year 
these rates will not change before july 
bge transferred  at book value  its nuclear generating assets  its nuclear decommissioning trust fund  and related liabilities to calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc in addition  bge transferred  at book value  its fossil generating assets and related liabilities and its partial ownership interest in two coal plants and a hydroelectric plant located in pennsylvania to constellation power source generation 
in total  these generating assets represent about  megawatts of generation capacity with a total net book value at june  of approximately billion 

bge assigned approximately million to calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc and million to constellation power source generation of tax exempt debt related to the transferred assets 
also  constellation power source generation issued approximately million in unsecured promissory notes to bge 
repayments of the notes by constellation power source generation will be used exclusively to service the current maturities of certain bge long term debt 

bge transferred equity associated with the generating assets to calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc and constellation power source generation 

the fossil fuel and nuclear fuel inventories  materials and supplies  and certain purchased power contracts of bge were also assumed by these subsidiaries 
effective july   bge provides standard offer service to customers at fixed rates over various time periods during the transition period for those customers that do not choose an alternate supplier 
in addition  the electric fuel rate was discontinued effective july  constellation power source provides bge with the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations for the first three years of the transition period 
thereafter  bge will competitively bid the energy and capacity 
constellation power source obtains the energy and capacity to supply bge s standard offer service obligations from affiliates that own calvert cliffs nuclear power plant calvert cliffs and bge s former fossil plants  supplemented with energy and capacity purchased from the wholesale market as necessary 
other states our domestic merchant energy business is focused on expanding its business through marketing energy products to wholesale customers and acquiring control of additional generating facilities 
this business will focus on states with strong growth in energy demand and that provide opportunities through ongoing deregulation and the creation of competitive markets 
delays in  or the ultimate form of  deregulation of electric generation in various states may affect our domestic merchant energy business strategy 
our domestic merchant energy business has million invested in power projects that sell megawatts of electricity in california under power purchase agreements as discussed in the california power purchase agreements section 
the counterparties to the agreements are two california investor owned utilities 
due to various factors  including shortage of generation and the high cost of natural gas  these utilities financial condition was severely impacted because they were paying more for power than they were allowed to recover from their customers under the deregulation plan in california 
as a result  these utilities have not been able to maintain current payments for the power they purchased to meet their customers energy needs and the credit ratings of these utilities were downgraded below investment grade 
the governor and legislature of california have undertaken emergency actions to stabilize the financial condition of the two utilities by purchasing power on behalf of these utilities and pursuing legislation that should permit the utilities to pay their power costs 
in the meantime  these utilities have not been paying our california projects in full for power supplied to them from december as of the date of this report  our portion of the amount due from these utilities is approximately million 
while we expect to be paid for this power  we cannot predict when payment will occur or if full payment will be received 
we have taken reserves in amounts we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on march   the california public utilities commission issued an order for an immediate retail rate increase 
accordingly  we expect that this order should enable these utilities to pay us for all future power supplied to these utilities 
however  if the ultimate resolution of the events in california prevents collection of unpaid balances under power purchase agreements by some or all of our projects  it could have a material impact on our financial results 
additionally  if the events in california result in a modification or termination of these agreements that reduces future cash flows  we would have to evaluate whether our investments in the power projects that are parties to the agreements are impaired 
an impairment of these investments could have a material impact on our financial results 
our domestic merchant energy business does not have any other direct agreements with these utilities 
however  we may be impacted if one or more of our other counterparties is significantly affected by the events in california  or by the operation of the california power exchange 
gas competition currently  no regulation exists for the wholesale price of natural gas as a commodity  and the regulation of interstate transmission at the federal level has been reduced 
all bge gas customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
regulation by the maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring which was discussed earlier  regulation by the maryland psc influences bge s businesses 
under traditional rate regulation that continues after july  for bge s electric transmission and distribution  and gas businesses  the maryland psc determines the rates we can charge our customers 
prior to july   bge s regulated electric rates consisted primarily of a base rate and a fuel rate 
effective july   bge discontinued its electric fuel rate and unbundled its rates to show separate components for delivery service  competitive transition charges  standard offer services generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a base rate and a fuel rate 
base rate the base rate is the rate the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them service  plus a profit 
bge has both an electric base rate and a gas base rate 
higher electric base rates apply during the summer when the demand for electricity is higher 
gas base rates are not affected by seasonal changes 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover increased utility fixed asset costs  plus a profit  beginning at the time of replacement 
generally  rate increases improve our utility earnings because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
on november   bge filed an application with the maryland psc to increase its gas base rates 
on june   the maryland psc authorized a million annual increase in our gas base rates effective june  as a result of the restructuring order  bge s residential electric base rates are frozen until electric delivery service rates are frozen for a four year period for commercial and industrial customers 
the generation and transmission components of rates are frozen for different time periods depending on the service options selected by those customers 
fuel rate through june   we charged our electric customers separately for the fuel we used to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and for the net cost of purchases and sales of electricity 
we charged the actual cost of these items to the customer with no profit to us 
if these fuel costs went up  the maryland psc permitted us to increase the fuel rate 
under the restructuring order  bge s electric fuel rate was frozen until july   at which time the fuel rate clause was discontinued 
we deferred the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collected from customers under the fuel rate through june  in september  the maryland psc approved the collection of the million accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers that were deferred under the electric fuel rate clause through june  we are collecting this accumulated difference from customers over the twelve month period beginning october effective july   our earnings are affected by the changes in the cost of fuel and energy 
we charge our gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase from us 
the price we charge for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates in more detail in the gas cost adjustments section and in note ferc regulation regional transmission organizations in december  ferc issued order  amending its regulations under the federal power act to advance the formation of regional transmission organizations rtos 
the regulations require that each public utility that owns  operates  or controls facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce make certain filings with respect to forming and participating in a rto 
ferc also identified the minimum characteristics and functions that a transmission entity must satisfy in order to be considered a rto 
according to order  a public utility that is a member of an existing transmission entity that has been approved by ferc as in conformance with the independent system operator iso principles set forth in the ferc order no 
 such as bge  through its membership in pjm pennsylvania new jersey maryland interconnection  was required to make a filing no later than january  pjm and the joint transmission owners  including bge  made the filing on october  that filing explained the extent to which pjm met the minimum characteristics and functions of a rto and explained its plans to conform to these characteristics and functions 
as a member of pjm  an existing iso  bge does not expect to be materially impacted by order however  we are appealing two requirements of order whereby 
we would have to go through pjm to make a filing with ferc to change our transmission rates  and 
we would have to transfer operational control of our transmission facilities to pjm 
the us supreme court agreed to hear an appeal by others of ferc order we cannot predict the outcome of this appeal or the impact on bge at this time 
weather domestic merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our domestic merchant energy business 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time 
since the majority of our generating plants currently are located in pjm  our financial results are affected  to a greater extent  by weather conditions in this area 
however  by  we expect to control approximately  megawatts of generation throughout various regions of north america 
current weather conditions also can affect the forward market price of energy commodity and derivative contracts used by our power marketing operation that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
to the extent that our power marketing operation purchases and sells such contracts  our financial results could be influenced by the impact that weather conditions have on the market price of such contracts 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
residential sales for our regulated businesses are impacted more by weather than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
however  the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our regulated gas business revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns 
we discuss this further in the weather normalization section 
we measure the weather s effect using degree days 
a degree day is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of degrees 
cooling degree days result when the average daily actual temperature exceeds the degree baseline 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the baseline 
during the cooling season  hotter weather is measured by more cooling degree days and results in greater demand for electricity to operate cooling systems 
during the heating season  colder weather is measured by more heating degree days and results in greater demand for electricity and gas to operate heating systems 
we show the number of cooling and heating degree days in and  the percentage change in the number of degree days from the prior year  and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by the year average in the following table 
year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year heating degree days    percentage change from prior year other factors other factors  aside from weather  impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
under the restructuring order  bge s electric customers can become delivery service customers only and can purchase their electricity from other sources 
we will collect a delivery service charge to recover the fixed costs for the service we provide 
the remaining electric customers will receive standard offer service from bge at the fixed rates provided by the restructuring order 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downtrend  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental and legal matters you will find details of our environmental and legal matters in note you will find additional details of our environmental matters under item business environmental matters 
some of the information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards issued we discuss recently issued accounting standards in note results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them

total earnings per share before extraordinary item extraordinary loss see note 
total earnings per share earnings for the years presented reflect a significant shift from the regulated electric business to the domestic merchant energy business as a result of the transfer of bge s electric generation assets to nonregulated subsidiaries on july  in accordance with the restructuring order 
we discuss the restructuring order in more detail in note our total earnings increased million  or 
per share  compared to mostly because we recorded an extraordinary charge of million  or 
per share  associated with the deregulation of the electric generation portion of our business in in addition  we recorded several nonrecurring charges in that had a negative impact in that year as discussed below 
in  we recorded the following nonrecurring charges in operations 
million after tax  or 
per share  deregulation transition cost in june to a third party incurred by our power marketing operation to provide bge s standard offer service requirements  and 
million after tax  or 
per share  expense during the first and second quarters of for bge employees that elected to participate in a targeted voluntary special early retirement program tvserp 
earnings before nonrecurring charges included in operations decreased million  or 
per share  mostly because we recognized million  or million after tax  of the annual residential rate reduction that was effective july  and we had higher interest costs in compared to we also recognized million after tax  or 
per share  for contributions to the universal service fund relating to the deregulation of electric generation 
these decreases were offset partially by higher earnings in our domestic merchant energy and our other nonregulated businesses 
in  earnings from our domestic merchant energy business before nonrecurring charges increased compared to because of higher earnings in both our power marketing and domestic generation operations 
in  earnings from our other nonregulated businesses increased mostly because of higher earnings in our financial investments operation 
our total earnings decreased million  or 
per share  compared to our total earnings decreased mostly because we recorded an extraordinary charge associated with the deregulation of the electric generation portion of our business 
we discuss the extraordinary charge in note our total earnings also include the following nonrecurring items included in our operations 
our regulated electric business recorded million after tax  or 
per share  of expenses related to hurricane floyd 

our domestic generation operation recorded write downs of certain power projects for million after tax  or 
per share  and our latin american operation recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write down of a power project 

our financial investments operation recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write down of a financial investment 

our real estate and senior living facilities operation recorded a million after tax  or 
per share  write down of certain senior living facilities 
these decreases were offset partially by higher earnings from regulated utility  domestic merchant energy  and other nonregulated business operations excluding nonrecurring charges 
in  regulated utility earnings before the extraordinary charge increased compared to mostly because we had higher electricity and gas system sales that year  and we settled a capacity contract with peco energy company in that had a negative impact on earnings in that year 
this increase was offset partially by higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to the million amortization of the regulatory asset recorded in for the reduction of our generation plant under the restructuring order  which reduced earnings by million 
in  earnings from our domestic merchant energy business before nonrecurring charges increased compared to mostly because of higher earnings from our power marketing operation 
in  earnings from our other nonregulated businesses before nonrecurring charges increased compared to mostly because of higher earnings from our latin american and real estate and senior living facilities operations 
in the following sections  we discuss our earnings by business segment in greater detail 
domestic merchant energy business our domestic merchant energy business engages primarily in power marketing and domestic power generation 
as discussed in the current issues electric competition section  our domestic merchant energy business was significantly impacted by the july  implementation of customer choice in maryland 
at that time  bge s generating assets became part of our nonregulated domestic merchant energy business  and constellation power source began selling to bge the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations for the first three years of the transition period 
constellation power source obtains the energy and capacity to supply bge s standard offer service obligations from affiliates that own calvert cliffs and bge s former fossil plants  supplemented with energy and capacity purchased from the wholesale market as necessary 
constellation power source also manages our wholesale market price risk 
in addition  effective july   domestic merchant energy business revenues include of the competitive transition charges bge collects from its customers ctc revenues and the portion of bge s revenues providing for nuclear decommissioning costs 
our earnings are exposed to various market risks as discussed in the market risk section 
for example  our earnings are exposed to the risks of the competitive wholesale electricity market to the extent that our domestic merchant energy business has to purchase energy and or capacity to meet obligations to supply power or meet other energy related contractual arrangements at prices which may approach or exceed the applicable fixed sales price obligations 
if the price of obtaining energy in the wholesale market exceeds the fixed sales price  our earnings would be adversely affected 
we also are affected by operational risk  that is  the risk that a generating plant will not be available to produce energy when the energy is required 
imbalances in demand and supply can occur not only because of plant outages  but also because of transmission constraints  or extreme temperatures hot or cold causing demand to exceed available supply 
we cannot estimate the impact of the increased financial risks associated with the competitive wholesale electricity market 
however  these financial risks could have a material impact on our financial results

a million increase related to providing bge the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligation effective july  
a million increase related to ctc and decommissioning revenues included in the domestic merchant energy business effective july   and 
higher revenues from our power marketing and domestic generation operations 
our domestic merchant energy revenues increased million compared to mostly because of higher revenues from our power marketing operation offset partially by lower revenues from our domestic generation operation 
we discuss the revenues for our power marketing and domestic generation operations in the sections below 
power marketing power marketing revenues increased during compared to mostly because of higher transaction volumes in the mid atlantic  texas  and west regions  offset partially by lower margins 
power marketing revenues increased during compared to mostly because of higher transaction margins and volumes 
constellation power source uses the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss the mark to market method of accounting and constellation power source s activities in more detail in note as a result of the nature of its operations and the use of mark to market accounting  constellation power source s revenues and earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the effect on our revenues and earnings could be material 
the primary factors that cause these fluctuations are 
the number and size of new transactions  
the magnitude and volatility of changes in commodity prices and interest rates  and 
the number and size of open commodity and derivative positions constellation power source holds or sells 
constellation power source s management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative positions it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is possible that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from power marketing and trading activities  and such variations could be material 
assets and liabilities from energy trading activities as shown in our consolidated balance sheets increased significantly at december  compared to december  because of business growth during the period and increased market prices at the end of domestic generation our domestic generation revenues increased during compared to mostly because of three factors 
our domestic generation operation recognized million on the termination of an operating arrangement and the sale of certain subsidiaries 
in april  constellation operating services  inc cosi  a subsidiary of constellation power  inc  ended its exclusive arrangement with orion to operate orion s facilities 
orion purchased from cosi the four subsidiary companies formed to operate power plants owned by orion 

in november  our domestic generation operation recorded a million gain on the sale of approximately million shares of orion stock 

in  our domestic generation operation recorded a write off of two geothermal power projects as discussed below  which had a negative impact in that year 
in  our domestic generation revenues decreased compared to mostly because of three factors 
our domestic generation operation wrote off two geothermal power projects that totaled million 
these write offs occurred because the expected future cash flows from the projects were less than the investment in the projects 
for the first project  this resulted from the inability to restructure certain project agreements 
for the second project  the water temperature of the geothermal resource used by one of the plants for production declined 

in  our domestic generation operation recorded a million gain for its share of earnings in a partnership 
the partnership recognized a gain on the sale of its ownership interest in a power purchase agreement 

revenues from our california power purchase agreements decreased as discussed below 
california power purchase agreements our domestic generation operation has million invested in projects that sell electricity in california under power purchase agreements called interim standard offer no 
agreements 
under these agreements  the electricity rates changed from fixed rates to variable rates beginning in in  the last four projects transitioned to variable rates 
in and prior years  the projects that transitioned to variable rates had lower revenues under variable rates than they did under fixed rates 
in  the prices received under these agreements were higher due to increases in the variable rate pricing terms 
however  due to the uncertainties in california  the recent increases in prices may not be indicative of future prices 
we discuss the developments in california in the current issues electric competition section 
we also describe these projects and the transition process in note and note operating expenses during  domestic merchant energy operating expenses increased million compared to mostly because of three factors 
an increase of million in fuel costs and million in operations and maintenance costs 
these costs were associated with the generation plants that were transferred from bge effective july  
a million deregulation transition cost in june to a third party incurred by our power marketing operation to provide bge s standard offer service requirements

electric revenues the changes in electric revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions electric system sales volumes rates fuel rate surcharge total change in electric revenues from electric system sales interchange and other sales other total change in electric revenues electric system sales volumes electric system sales volumes are sales to customers in our service territory at rates set by the maryland psc 
these sales do not include interchange sales and sales to others 
the percentage changes in our electric system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we sold more electricity to residential customers compared to due to the colder winter weather  higher usage per customer  and an increased number of customers  offset partially by mild summer weather 
we sold more electricity to commercial customers mostly due to higher usage per customer and an increased number of customers 
we sold more electricity to industrial customers due to higher usage by bethlehem steel and an increased number of customers  offset partially by lower usage by other industrial customers 
usage was higher at bethlehem steel as a result of a shut down for a planned upgrade to their facilities that temporarily reduced their electricity consumption 
in  we sold more electricity to residential customers due to higher usage per customer  colder winter weather  and an increased number of customers compared to this increase was offset partially by milder spring and early summer weather 
we sold more electricity to commercial customers mostly due to higher usage per customer  an increased number of customers  and colder winter weather 
we sold less electricity to industrial customers mostly because usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers decreased 
this decrease was offset partially by an increase in the number of industrial customers 
rates prior to july   our rates primarily consisted of an electric base rate and an electric fuel rate 
effective july   bge discontinued its electric fuel rate and unbundled its rates to show separate components for delivery service  competitive transition charges  standard offer service generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 
bge s rates also were frozen in total except for the implementation of a residential base rate reduction totaling approximately million annually 
in addition  of the ctc revenues bge collects and the portion of its revenues providing for decommissioning costs  are included in revenues of the domestic merchant energy business effective july  in  rate revenues decreased compared to mostly because of the million decrease caused by the annual residential rate reduction  and the million transfer of revenues to the domestic merchant energy business discussed above 
this was offset partially by higher fuel rate revenues during the first half of in  rate revenues increased compared to because of higher fuel rate revenues 
fuel rate revenues increased mostly because we sold more electricity 
fuel rate surcharge in september  the maryland psc approved the collection of the million accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers that were deferred under the electric fuel rate clause through june  we discuss this further in the electric fuel rate clause section below 
interchange and other sales interchange and other sales are sales in the pjm energy market and to others 
pjm is an iso that operates a regional power pool with members that include many wholesale market participants  as well as bge  and other utility companies 
prior to the implementation of customer choice  bge sold energy to pjm members and to others after it had satisfied the demand for electricity in its own system 
effective july   bge no longer engages in interchange sales 
these activities are now included in our domestic merchant energy business which resulted in a decrease in interchange and other sales for the second half of compared to in addition  bge had lower interchange and other sales during the first half of when increased demand for system sales reduced the amount of energy bge had available for off system sales 
in  interchange and other sales revenues decreased compared to mostly because higher demand for system sales reduced the amount of energy bge had available for off system sales 
electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in millions actual costs net recovery deferral of costs under electric fuel rate clause total electric fuel and purchased energy expense actual costs in  our actual costs of fuel and purchased energy were higher compared to mostly because of the deregulation of our electric generation 
as discussed in the current issues electric competition section  effective july   bge transferred its generating assets to  and began purchasing substantially all of the energy and capacity required to provide electricity to standard offer service customers from  the domestic merchant energy business 
in  the cost of energy bge purchased from our domestic merchant energy business was million 
the higher amount paid for purchased energy is offset by the absence of million in fuel costs  and lower operations and maintenance  depreciation  taxes  and other costs at bge as a result of no longer owning and operating the transferred electric generation plants 
prior to july   bge s purchased fuel and energy costs only included actual costs of fuel to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and electricity we bought from others 
in  our actual costs of fuel to generate electricity and electricity we bought from others were higher compared to mostly because the price of electricity we bought from others was higher 
the price of electricity changes based on market conditions and contract terms 
this increase was offset partially by our settlement of a capacity contract with peco in electric fuel rate clause prior to july   we deferred included as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the consolidated statements of income the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collected from customers under the fuel rate in a given period 
effective july   the fuel rate clause was discontinued under the terms of the restructuring order 
in september  the maryland psc approved the collection of the million accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers that were deferred under the electric fuel rate clause through june  we are collecting this accumulated difference from customers over the twelve month period beginning october in  the net deferral of costs under the electric fuel rate clause decreased compared to due to the discontinuation of the fuel rate clause effective july  in  the net deferral of costs under the electric fuel rate clause increased compared to because the deferral reflected higher purchased power costs  especially during record setting summer peak loads 
electric operations and maintenance expenses in  regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses decreased million compared to mostly because effective july   million of costs were no longer incurred by this business segment 
these costs were associated with the electric generation assets that were transferred to the domestic merchant energy business 
in addition  operations and maintenance expenses included costs for system restoration activities related to hurricane floyd and a major winter ice storm  and costs associated with the preparation for the year yk 
these costs had a negative impact in that year 
these decreases are offset partially by the million of expense recognized in for electric business employees that elected to participate in the tvserp 
in  regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses were about the same compared to in  operations and maintenance expenses included the costs for system restoration activities related to hurricane floyd and a major winter ice storm 
this was offset by lower employee benefit costs in and a million write off of contributions to a third party for a low level radiation waste facility that was never completed 
electric depreciation and amortization expense in  regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense decreased million compared to mostly because of the absence of million of depreciation and amortization expense associated with the transfer of the generation assets 
this decrease was offset partially by more electric plant in service as our level of plant in service changes  the amount of depreciation and amortization expense changes and higher amortization associated with regulatory assets 
in  regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to mostly because of the million amortization of the regulatory asset for the reduction in generation plant provided for in the restructuring order 
this increase was offset partially by lower amortization of deferred electric conservation expenditures due to the write off of a portion of these expenditures that will not be recovered under the restructuring order 
we discuss the accounting implications of the restructuring order further in note electric taxes other than income taxes in  regulated electric taxes other than income taxes decreased million compared to this was mostly due to two factors 
regulated electric taxes other than income taxes reflect the absence of million of taxes other than income taxes associated with the generation assets that were transferred to the domestic merchant energy business effective july   and 
comprehensive changes to the tax laws 
the comprehensive tax law changes are discussed further in note in  regulated electric taxes other than income taxes increased slightly due to higher property and franchise taxes associated with increased electric revenues

to date  customer choice has not had a material effect on our  and bge s  financial results 
gas revenues the changes in gas revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions gas system sales volumes base rates weather normalization gas cost adjustments total change in gas revenues from gas system sales off system sales other total change in gas revenues gas system sales volumes the percentage changes in our gas system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we sold more gas to residential and commercial customers compared to due to higher usage per customer  colder weather  and an increased number of customers 
we sold less gas to industrial customers mostly because of lower usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers  offset partially by an increased number of customers 
in  we sold more gas to residential customers mostly for two reasons colder winter weather and an increased number of customers 
this was offset partially by lower usage per customer 
we sold more gas to commercial customers mostly because of higher usage per customer  colder winter weather  and an increased number of customers 
we sold less gas to industrial customers mostly because of lower usage by bethlehem steel and other industrial customers 
base rates in  base rate revenues increased slightly compared to mostly because the maryland psc authorized a million annual increase in our base rates effective june  in  base rate revenues increased compared to mostly because of the million annual increase in our base rates approved by the maryland psc effective march  weather normalization the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our gas revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns on our gas system sales volumes 
this means our monthly gas revenues are based on weather that is considered normal for the month and  therefore  are not affected by actual weather conditions 
gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note however  under market based rates  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers  and does not significantly impact earnings 
delivery service customers  including bethlehem steel  are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
we charge these customers fees to recover the fixed costs for the transportation service we provide 
these fees are the same as the base rate charged for gas sales and are included in gas system sales volumes 
in and  gas cost adjustment revenues increased compared to the respective prior year mostly because we sold more gas at a higher price 
in  the revenue increase reflects the significant increase in natural gas prices 
off system sales off system gas sales are low margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas outside our service territory 
off system gas sales  which occur after we have satisfied our customers demand  are not subject to gas cost adjustments 
the maryland psc approved an arrangement for part of the margin from off system sales to benefit customers through reduced costs and the remainder to be retained by bge which benefits shareholders 
in  revenues from off system gas sales increased compared to mostly because we sold more gas off system at significantly higher prices 
in  revenues from off system gas sales were about the same compared to gas purchased for resale expenses actual costs include the cost of gas purchased for resale to our customers and for off system sales 
actual costs do not include the cost of gas purchased by delivery service customers 
in  our gas costs increased compared to mostly because we bought more gas for off system sales and all of the gas purchased was at a higher price due to the significant increase in natural gas prices during the year 
in  actual gas costs increased compared to mostly because we sold more gas 
other gas operating expenses in and  other gas operating expenses were about the same compared to the respective prior year

earnings per share 


above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
in  earnings from our other nonregulated businesses increased compared to mostly because of better market performance of certain of our financial investments 
in addition  in  we wrote down a financial investment  our investment in a generating company in bolivia  and certain senior living facilities  which had negative impacts in that year 
these increases were offset partially by lower earnings from our latin american operation primarily due to increased operating expenses in guatemala 
in  earnings from our other nonregulated businesses increased compared to mostly because of higher earnings from our latin american and real estate and senior living facilities operations 
this increase was offset partially by lower earnings from our financial investments operation 
in  earnings from our latin american operation increased mostly because of higher earnings from the electric distribution company in panama compared to in october  an investment group  in which subsidiaries of our latin american operation hold an interest  purchased of the panamanian company 
this was offset partially by a million after tax write down of our investment in a generating company in bolivia to reflect the current fair value of this investment 
this write down was a result of our december decision to exit the latin american portion of our business as part of our strategy to improve our competitive position 
in  earnings from our real estate and senior living facilities operation increased compared to mostly because of 
a million after tax write down of its investment in church street station  an entertainment  dining  and retail complex in orlando  florida in that negatively impacted earnings that year  and 
an increase in earnings from its investment in corporate office properties trust copt in we discuss the investment in copt in note this increase was offset partially by a million after tax write down of certain senior living facilities related to the proposed sale of these facilities in as discussed below 
additionally  in  our energy products and services operation recorded a million after tax write off of an investment in  and certain of our product inventory from  an automated electric distribution equipment company 
in  our financial investments operation announced that it would exchange its shares of common stock in capital re  an insurance company  for common stock of ace  another insurance company  as part of a business combination whereby ace would acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of capital re 
as a result  our financial investments operation wrote down its million investment in capital re stock by million after tax to reflect the closing price of the business combination 
this write down of capital re was offset partially by better market performance of other financial investments in compared to in  our senior living facilities operation entered into an agreement to sell all but one of its senior living facilities to sunrise assisted living  inc under the terms of the agreement  sunrise was to acquire twelve of our existing senior living facilities  three facilities under construction  and several sites under development for million in cash and million in debt assumption 
we could not reach an agreement on financing issues that subsequently arose  and the agreement was terminated in november as a result  our senior living facilities operation engaged a third party management company to manage its portfolio 
however  our senior living facilities operation recorded a million after tax write down related to the proposed sale 
most of constellation real estate group s real estate and senior living projects are in the baltimore washington corridor 
the area has had a surplus of available land in recent years and as a result these projects have been economically hurt 
constellation real estate s projects have continued to incur carrying costs and depreciation over the years 
additionally  this operation has been charging interest payments to expense rather than capitalizing them for some undeveloped land where development activities have stopped 
these carrying costs  depreciation  and interest expenses have decreased earnings and are expected to continue to do so 
cash flow from real estate and senior living operations has not been enough to make the monthly loan payments on some of these projects 
cash shortfalls have been covered by cash obtained from the cash flows of  or additional borrowings by  other nonregulated subsidiaries 
we consider market demand  interest rates  the availability of financing  and the strength of the economy in general when making decisions about our real estate and senior living projects 
if we were to decide to sell our projects  we could have write downs 
in addition  if we were to sell our projects in the current market  we would have losses which could be material  although the amount of the losses is hard to predict 
depending on market conditions  we could also have material losses on any future sales 
our current real estate and senior living strategy is to hold each project until we can realize a reasonable value for it 
under accounting rules  we are required to write down the value of a project to market value in either of two cases 
the first is if we change our intent about a project from an intent to hold to an intent to sell and the market value of that project is below book value 
the second is if the expected cash flow from the project is less than the investment in the project 
consolidated nonoperating income and expenses fixed charges in  fixed charges increased million compared to mostly because we had more debt outstanding 
in  fixed charges decreased million compared to mostly because we had less bge preference stock outstanding 
income taxes in  our total income taxes increased million compared to mostly because we had higher taxable income from our nonregulated businesses and an increase in state and local taxes as a result of comprehensive changes to these laws 
this increase was offset partially by lower taxable income at bge 
we discuss the comprehensive tax law changes in note in  income taxes increased million compared to because we had higher taxable income from both our regulated utility operations and our nonregulated businesses 
financial condition cash flows in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities  financing activities in and  cash provided by operations changed compared to the respective prior year mostly because of changes in working capital requirements 
in  we used more cash for investing activities compared to mostly due to substantial increases in our domestic merchant energy capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives 
in  we used less cash for investing activities compared to mostly due to lower investments in latin american power projects and in the real estate and senior living facilities operation 
this was offset partially by a million increase in the investment in orion  an increase in our investment in domestic power projects  and an increase in capital expenditures by our regulated utility business 
in  we had more cash from financing activities compared to mostly because we issued more long term debt and common stock 
this was offset partially by an increase in net maturities of short term borrowings and we repaid more long term debt 
in  we used more cash for financing activities compared to mostly because we repaid more long term debt and issued less long term debt and common stock 
this was offset partially by a decrease in the redemption of bge preference stock and an increase in our net short term borrowings

electric generation electric construction expenditures for our regulated electric business include improvements to generating plants and costs for replacing the steam generators at calvert cliffs through june  thereafter  these expenditures are reflected in our domestic merchant energy business 
in march  we received the license extension from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc that extends our operating licenses at calvert cliffs to for unit and for unit if we do not replace the steam generators  we will not be able to operate these units through our operating license periods 
we expect the steam generator replacement to occur during the refueling outage for unit and during the refueling outage for unit we estimate these calvert cliffs costs to be

funding for capital requirements on october   we announced initiatives designed to advance our growth strategies in the domestic merchant energy business and a change in our common stock dividend policy effective april  as discussed in the strategy section 
as part of these initiatives  we expect to redeem all of the outstanding debt at constellation energy at or prior to the separation of our domestic merchant energy business and remaining businesses 
the redemption will occur through a combination of open market purchases  tender offers  and redemption calls 
we expect to fund this redemption with short term debt or other credit facilities  and to refinance this debt longer term after the separation 
on march   we issued million shares of common stock with net proceeds of million 
domestic merchant energy business funding for the expansion of our domestic merchant energy business is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper  long term debt  equity  leases  and other financing instruments issued by constellation energy and its subsidiaries 
specifically related to the nine mile point acquisition  one half of the purchase price  or million  is due at the closing of the transaction and the remainder is being financed through the sellers in a note to be repaid over five years with an interest rate of 
we expect to close the transaction with funds from available sources at that time 
payments on the note over the five years are expected to come from internally generated funds 
longer term  we expect to fund our growth and operating objectives with a mixture of debt and equity with an overall goal of maintaining an investment grade credit profile 
when our domestic merchant energy business separates from our remaining businesses  it initially expects to reinvest its earnings to fund its growth and not to pay a dividend 
constellation energy has a commercial paper program where it can issue up to million in short term notes to fund its nonregulated businesses 
to support its commercial paper program  constellation energy maintains two revolving credit agreements totaling million  of which one facility can also issue letters of credit 
in addition  constellation energy has access to interim lines of credit as required from time to time to support its outstanding commercial paper 
bge funding for utility capital expenditures is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper issuances  available capacity under credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  trust securities  or preference stock  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
at december   ferc authorized bge to issue up to million of short term borrowings  including commercial paper 
in addition  bge maintains million in annual committed bank lines of credit and has million in bank revolving credit agreements to support the commercial paper program 
in addition  bge has access to interim lines of credit as required from time to time to support its outstanding commercial paper 
during the three years from through  we expect our regulated utility business to provide at least of the cash needed to meet the capital requirements for its operations  excluding cash needed to retire debt 
other nonregulated businesses bge home products services may meet capital requirements through sales of receivables 
comfortlink has a revolving credit agreement totaling million to provide liquidity for short term financial needs 
if we can get a reasonable value for our real estate projects  senior living facilities  latin american operation  and other investments  additional cash may be obtained by selling them 
our ability to sell or liquidate assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made 
we discuss the real estate and senior living facilities operation and market conditions in the other nonregulated businesses section 
we discuss our short term borrowings in note and long term debt in note market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices  equity prices  and foreign currency 
to manage our market risk  we may enter into various derivative instruments including swaps  forward contracts  futures contracts  and options 
effective july   we are subject to additional market risk associated with the purchase and sale of energy as discussed in the current issues section 
we discuss our market risk further in note in this section  we discuss our current market risk and the related use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
the following table provides information about our obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date fair value at thereafter total dec 
 dollar amounts in millions long term debt variable rate debt   average interest rate fixed rate debt    average interest rate commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  and other commodities 
domestic merchant energy business our domestic merchant energy business is exposed to market risk from the power marketing operation of constellation power source and from our electric generation operations 
constellation power source manages the commodity price risk inherent in its power marketing activities on a portfolio basis  subject to established trading and risk management policies 
commodity price risk arises from the potential for changes in the value of energy commodities and related derivatives due to changes in commodity prices  volatility of commodity prices  and fluctuations in interest rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the electricity market significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
these factors include 
seasonal changes in demand  
hourly fluctuations in demand due to weather conditions  
available supply resources  
transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  
procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and 
changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in 
weather conditions  
market liquidity  
capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and 
the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
constellation power source uses various methods  including a value at risk model  to measure its exposure to market risk 
value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price and volatility data 
constellation power source calculates value at risk using a variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  constellation power source estimates variances and correlation using historical market movements over the most recent rolling three month period 
the value at risk amount represents the potential loss in the fair value of assets and liabilities from trading activities over a one day holding period with a confidence level 
using this confidence level  constellation power source would expect a one day change in fair value greater than or equal to the daily value at risk at least once per year 
constellation power source s value at risk was million as of december  compared to million as of december  the average  high  and low value at risk for the year ended december  was million  million  and million  respectively 
constellation power source s value at risk calculation includes all assets and liabilities from its power marketing and trading activities  including energy commodities and derivatives that do not require cash settlements 
we believe that this represents a more complete calculation of our value at risk 
due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk  the relative immaturity of the competitive market for electricity and related derivatives  and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the value at risk calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities from power marketing and trading activities could differ from the calculated value at risk  and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
please refer to the forward looking statements section 
we discuss constellation power source s operation in the domestic merchant energy business section and in note our domestic merchant energy business conducts electric generation operations primarily through constellation power source generation  calvert cliffs  and constellation power 
presently  the majority of the generating capacity controlled by our domestic merchant energy business is used to provide standard offer service to bge 
however  beginning in july  we expect approximately  megawatts of industrial customer load will leave standard offer service 
the remainder of the standard offer service arrangement with bge terminates on june  additionally  we plan to expand our generation operations as discussed in the strategy section 
as a result  our domestic merchant energy business has a substantial and increasing amount of generating capacity that is subject to future changes in wholesale electricity prices and has fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
additionally  if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sale commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
constellation power source manages the commodity price risk of our electric generation operations as part of its overall portfolio 
additionally  the domestic merchant energy business may enter into fixed price contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to future electricity and fuel commodity price risk 
regulated electric business the standard offer service arrangement between bge and constellation power source ends june  under the restructuring order  effective july   bge s residential rates are frozen for a six year period and its commercial and industrial rates are frozen for four to six years 
as a result  bge will be subject to commodity price risk beginning july  upon termination of the existing standard offer arrangement 
in accordance with the restructuring order  bge will competitively bid the standard offer service supply for the remaining period of the rate freeze subsequent to june  during the remaining period of bge s rate freeze  bge will be unable to pass through to its customers any increase in the market price of electricity it must purchase to meet the standard offer service load 
our regulated electric business is evaluating various alternatives to minimize the market risk after june  regulated gas business our regulated gas business may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program 
we discuss this further in note at december  and  our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk  primarily through constellation power source 
credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
constellation power source uses credit policies to control its credit risk  including utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral or prepayment arrangements  and using master netting agreements 
however  due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of electricity commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity constellation power source had contracted for  constellation power source could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
our domestic merchant energy business sells electricity to two california investor owned utilities under long term power purchase agreements that recently were downgraded by rating agencies to below investment grade 
we discuss the credit and other exposures under these agreements in the current issues section 
equity price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets primarily through our financial investments operation and our nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
we are required by the nrc to maintain a trust to fund the costs of decommissioning calvert cliffs 
we believe our exposure to fluctuations in equity prices will not have a material impact on our financial results 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust fund in more detail in note we also describe our financial investments in more detail in note foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through our latin american operation 
our latin american operation has million invested in international power generation and distribution projects as of december  to manage our exposure to foreign currency risk  the majority of our contracts are denominated in or indexed to the us dollar 
at december  and  foreign currency risk was not material
