such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation the following competition minerals 
the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the us market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products by the metalcasting and construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results may be adversely affected in the minerals and environmental segments  respectively 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become difficult or expensive for us to comply

the company may be subject to adverse litigation results in addition to as future changes in laws and regulations that may negatively impact its operations and profits 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally

currently  our business outside the united states represents approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa along with the middle east 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks  which may include the following currency exchange or price control laws  currency translation adjustments  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand for the company s products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
at december   approximately of the gross accounts receivable were due from customers outside of the united states and canada 
the breakdown of the overseas balance was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa and the middle east 
volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our financial results  our introduction of new services or products  announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels
