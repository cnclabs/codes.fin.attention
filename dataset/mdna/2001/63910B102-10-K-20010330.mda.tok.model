item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies experiencing rapid growth and  in particular  rapidly growing companies that operate in evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 
although we have experienced net sales growth in recent years  our net sales growth may not continue  and we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability 
the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative royalties litigation settlement total operating expenses operating income other income income before income taxes income tax expense net income comparison of the years ending december  and december  net sales net sales grew by to million in from million in sales within our direct products segment increased by over prior year levels and accounted for million  or  of our aggregate net sales in net sales within our commercial and retail product segment increased by over prior year levels and accounted for million  or of our net sales 
sales growth in primarily resulted from expanded direct marketing of our bowflex and nautilus sleep systems products and the growth we experienced in ecommerce sales  as well as the positive impact of the strong domestic economy that existed until late within our direct products segment  with respect to both our bowflex products and our nautilus sleep systems  we intend to further expand our use of spot television commercials and expand our use of infomercials of our bowflex products during by increasing our presence in existing television markets and entering new television markets 
we intend to increase sales within our nautilus products segment by continuing to develop new products and expanding our direct sales efforts both domestically and internationally 
except for the fourth quarter  fiscal sales of our bowflex products appear to have been consistent with historic trends 
as in prior years  first and third quarter sales of our bowflex products were strong  while the second quarter reflected seasonal weakness 
our direct marketing business is largely dependent upon national cable television advertising  and we are finding that second quarter influences on television viewership  such as the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather factors  are causing our spot television commercials on national cable television to be marginally less effective than in other periods of the year 
during the fourth quarter of and  we experienced unusually strong consumer demand compared to the third quarter for our bowflex products  which we believe is a trend that will not continue for the fourth quarter in future periods 
sales within our commercial and retail business were  and we believe will continue to be  strongest in the third and fourth quarters 
we believe the principal reason for this trend is the commercial fitness industry s preparation for the impact of new year fitness resolutions and seasonal weather factors in the fourth quarter  and retail fitness store purchases of fitness equipment in preparation for the christmas buying season and new year fitness resolutions in the third and fourth quarters 
notwithstanding our product diversification efforts  we anticipate that sales of our bowflex power pro will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
any significant diminished consumer interest in this product line would sharply reduce our net sales and profitability 
in addition  the success of each of our products depends substantially on how consumers decide to spend their money and the amount of disposable income they have 
unfavorable economic conditions may depress consumer spending  especially for premium priced products like ours 
gross profit gross profit grew to million in  from million in our gross profit margin increased to in  from in this increase was mainly attributable to the net sales of direct products as a percentage of total net sales 
the margin within our direct products segment was in  while there was a margin within our commercial and retail products segment for sales of our direct products comprised of net sales in  compared with in this increase in percentage of direct products sold  along with strong ecommerce sales at higher margins  resulted in the higher profit margin for we expect a lower percentage gross profit margin contribution from our nautilus sleep systems  compared to our bowflex products  as we continue our direct marketing campaign for this product 
similar to our bowflex products  with the anticipated future higher sales volume of nautilus sleep systems  we expect to take advantage of overseas production and new vendor relationships to strengthen the margins for these products 
operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of

royalty royalty expense grew to million in from million in  an increase of

our royalty expenses will increase if sales of our bowflex products continue to increase

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth primarily from cash generated by our operating activities 
during  our operating activities generated million in net cash  which contributed to an aggregate million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as of december  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  through a stock repurchase program  we bought back million in common stock on the open market 
our capital expenditures in totaled million  including million for land in las vegas  nevada and million for land and a building in vancouver  washington 
these activities resulted in a million  or increase in our cash and cash equivalents during we anticipate our working capital requirements will increase as a result of growing our nautilus commercial and retail fitness operations 
we also expect to increase our cash expenditures on spot commercials and infomercials as we continue to expand the direct marketing campaigns for our bowflex products and nautilus sleep systems 
in january  the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock in open market transactions from january  through april   with the terms of the purchases to be determined by management based on market condition 
we maintain a million line of credit with bank of america increased from million on april  
the line of credit is secured by our general assets and contains certain financial covenants 
as of the date of these financial statements  we are in compliance with all material covenants applicable to the line of credit and there is no outstanding balance under the line 
we believe our existing cash balances  combined with our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
inflation and price increases although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had or is likely in the foreseeable future to materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
however  increases in inflation over historical levels or uncertainty in the general economy could decrease discretionary consumer spending for products like ours 
we have not raised the prices on any of our products since consequently  none of our revenue growth is attributable to price increases 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas

in the fourth quarter of  we adopted emerging issues task force consensus  accounting for shipping and handling costs eitf 
as a result of this adoption  we now account for revenue generated by shipping products to customers as net sales 
previously  these amounts were included in cost of sales along with the related costs incurred to ship the products 
net sales and cost of sales for prior periods have been restated to reflect eitf consensus item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  we have invested cash with banks and in highly liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of three months or less 
our bank deposits may exceed federally insured limits and there is risk of loss of the entire principal with any debt instrument 
to reduce risk of loss  we limit our exposure to any one debt issuer and require certain minimum ratings for debt instruments that we purchase
