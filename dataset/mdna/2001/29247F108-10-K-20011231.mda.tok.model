by may  the voting interest percentage had decreased to 
because the company s voting interest dropped below effective may  and the company does not otherwise have control  the company began to account for its investment in firstsource under the equity method of accounting 
effective april   firstsource operations ceased and all of the assets of firstsource were assigned to sherwood partners  inc  unaffiliated with the company  as an assignee for the benefit of creditors 
in november  the company formed a new subsidiary  supplyaccess  inc supplyaccess  to address the larger corporate customers needs to find product via the internet at the most favorable prices 
supplyaccess was designed as an internet portal charging transaction fees to the seller 
the company transferred its it department and related computer equipment and software to supplyaccess in exchange for a million note receivable 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
concurrently it was agreed that supplyaccess would provide the company with it services and would allow company customers access to its fulfillment engine for the initial year for a flat quarterly fee of in february  supplyaccess completed an initial private placement of  shares of convertible preferred stock at a share  which reduced the company s voting interest to

however  the company has agreed to make monthly payments to supplyaccess of  for the rights to the accesspointe web site and content therein 
the company s net sales increased from million in fiscal the company s first full year of operations to million in fiscal  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
the past growth in net sales was principally driven by sales to new customers and increased sales to existing customers as well as geographic expansion through the opening of additional sales offices 
however  in fiscal the company experienced its first annual decline of million in sales due to a softer pc market and difficulties in transitioning to a new business erp system 
fiscal year has continued the negative trend with a decline of million in net sales 
fiscal quarterly net sales compared to the respective prior fiscal year quarters have shown a consistent negative trend throughout the fiscal year 
percentage declines commencing with the first quarter of the fiscal year were    and  respectively 
sequentially net sales declined in every quarter of fiscal except for the june quarter  which registered a modest increase 
the company does not anticipate a reversal of the sales decline until later in fiscal to counter the sales decline  the company conducted two restructurings of its sales and administrative force in fiscal years and leased sales offices were converted into virtual offices in which employees work from home based offices 
home offices were equipped with dsl lines and the latest in information technology equipment 
full technical and administrative support were committed by corporate headquarters to assist field personnel in improving customer support 
also moderating the impact of the sales decline was an overall improvement in gross profit margins rising to in fiscal from a year ago  principally from a lessening of competitive pricing and higher margins from the company s expanding service business 
nevertheless the increase in gross profit margins was insufficient to offset the loss of margins from the sales volume decline and total gross profits declined million 
operating expenses  exclusive of non recurring charges  were million  a notable reduction from prior year core operating expenses of million  which excludes million of operating expenses from subsidiaries that were subsequently deconsolidated 
non recurring charges declined million  which combined with the decline in other core operating expenses helped to compensate for the million gross profits decline and narrowed the operating loss to million  a substantial improvement from the million operating loss of the prior year  that was burdened with substantial operating losses from its former subsidiaries prior to their deconsolidation 
because the company s business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  the company does not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
the company typically does not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to the company s configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of the company s net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although the company maintains a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  it records as inventory the merchandise being configured and products purchased from distributors  but not yet shipped to customers 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipment 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by the company s distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits

income losses from affiliates 
as a result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements  in the june quarter of the company began using the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the losses related to the two affiliates

such losses were in large part reversed in fiscal and taken to income as the guarantees and obligations were removed or discharged 
provision for income taxes 
because the loss reversal income from affiliates of million is not subject to tax  and tax adjustments for other differences between book and tax are inconsequential  the company anticipates a tax net operating loss nol for the fiscal year 
since there are no longer any open prior years with taxable income to which the nol may be carried back  no benefit has been recognized for the current year tax loss 
the current provision for income taxes relates to certain minimum state income and franchise taxes

interest expense decreased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal of the million decrease  million related to interest income that was netted in interest expense 
the remaining million decrease in interest expense was due to the decline in borrowing under the lines  due to declining sales volumes 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal operating activities provided cash totaling million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
a decline of million in accounts receivable represented the largest single cash producing reconciling item 
in fiscal  accounts receivable  before allowances for returns and doubtful accounts declined mainly due to the decline in fourth quarter net sales from those in the prior fiscal year s quarter as well as to improved collection activity 
the company s accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts  at september  and  was million and million  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased to days from days  as of september  and  respectively 
however  when computing the dso on fourth quarter fiscal net sales  the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreases to only days  compared to days in the prior year 
investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal compared with using million cash in the prior year 
the cash used from investing activities in fiscal was for the acquisition of property and equipment 
financing activities used net cash totaling million in fiscal  while providing cash of million in fiscal most of the financing cash used was for the repayments of the lines of credit  which was consistent with the decline in accounts receivable upon which the financing is based

the company has a revolving credit facility with ibm credit corporation ibmcc that is collateralized by accounts receivable and all other assets of the company 
as of september   such lines of credit provided for maximum aggregate borrowings of approximately million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the ibmcc line of credit was increased to prime plus effective april  from prime less 
that was in effect prior to that
