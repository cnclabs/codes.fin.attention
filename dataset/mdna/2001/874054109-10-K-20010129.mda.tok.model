the following table sets forth the percentages of our publishing revenues derived from sales of titles for specific platforms during the periods indicated year ended october platform pc sony playstation sony playstation nintendo gameboy sega dreamcast nintendo revenue recognition 
our principal sources of revenues are derived from publishing and distribution operations 
publishing revenues are derived from the sale of internally developed software or software licensed from third parties 
distribution revenues are derived from the sale of third party software and hardware 
our publishing operations typically generate higher margins than distribution operations  with sales of pc software resulting in higher margins than sales of cds or cartridges designed for video game consoles 
we recognize revenue from software sales when product ownership and risk of loss pass to our customers 
returns and reserves 
our arrangements with customers for published titles require us to accept returns for stock balancing  markdowns or defects 
we establish a reserve for future returns of published titles at the time of sales based primarily on our return policies and historical return rates  and we recognize revenues net of returns 
our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders 
however  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations to customers  which include price discounts  credits and returns  when demand for specific titles fall below expectations 
our sales returns and allowances for the years ended october  and were  and  respectively 
at october   our reserve against accounts receivable for returns  customer accommodations and doubtful accounts was approximately  if future returns significantly exceed our reserves  our operating results would be adversely affected 
capitalized costs 
our agreements with licensors and developers generally require us to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are amortized at the contractual royalty rate as cost of sales based on actual net sales 
at october   we had prepaid royalties of  we also capitalize internal software development costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a title 
amortization of such costs is based on the greater of the proportion of current year sales to total estimated sales commencing with the title s release or the straight line method 
at october   we had capitalized software development costs of  we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized costs 
if we were required to write off these payments or costs to a material extent in future periods  our results of operations would be adversely affected

sales of our titles are also seasonal  with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter our fourth and first fiscal quarters as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season 
accordingly  quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
the following table sets forth our quarterly results for the immediately preceding eight quarters amounts in thousands  except per share data quarter ended net sales         operating income         basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements have been and will continue to be to fund developing  publishing and distributing our software products

because we have invested heavily during recent years to position our company as a top tier software publisher  we have experienced negative cash flows from operations 
looking forward  we are focusing our principal efforts on generating positive cash flow  and we expect to achieve positive cash flow from operations for the fiscal quarter ending january  net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of cash paid for investments and acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal l and  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased borrowings under our line of credit  the proceeds from private placements of common stock in april and july aggregating  and a subordinated loan financing in july in the amount of  at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of  in december  we entered into a credit agreement  as amended  with a group of lenders led by bank of america  na  as agent  which currently provides for borrowings of up to  decreasing to  in march 
thereafter  we may increase the credit line to up to  subject to certain conditions 
generally  advances under the line of credit are based on a borrowing formula equal to the lesser of the borrowing limit or of eligible accounts receivable  plus of eligible inventory 
interest accrues on such advances at the bank s prime rate plus  or at libor plus 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  general intangibles  securities and other personal property  including the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries 
in addition to certain financial covenants  the loan agreement limits or prohibits us from declaring or paying cash dividends  merging or consolidating with another corporation  selling assets other than in the ordinary course of business  creating liens and incurring additional indebtedness

we do not hold any collateral to secure payment by our customers 
as a result  we are subject to credit risks  particularly in the event that any of our receivables represent sales to a limited number of retailers or are concentrated in foreign markets
