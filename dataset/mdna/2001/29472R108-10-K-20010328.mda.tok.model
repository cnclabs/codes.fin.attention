funds from operations ffo was redefined by nareit in october  effective january   as net income computed in accordance with gaap  before allocation to minority interests  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the nareit definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reit s computations 
funds available for distribution fad is defined as ffo less non revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage loan principal 
the company believes that ffo and fad are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures 
ffo and fad in and of themselves do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs
