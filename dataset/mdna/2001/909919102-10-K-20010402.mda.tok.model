certain statements in this report  including the following section  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which involve risks and uncertainties 
united s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forwarding looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  competition and weather conditions in the geographic and business areas in which united conducts its operations  fluctuations in interest rates  credit quality and government regulations 
ufc is the result of the combination on february  of two savings and loan holding companies operating in montana heritage and old united 
although ufc was the surviving corporation  the merger was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes because the stockholders and management of heritage controlled the operation of ufc after the heritage merger 
using purchase accounting  the historical financial statements of ufc included in this report for periods preceding the heritage merger reflect only the operations of heritage  while the historical financial statements for periods after the heritage merger reflect combined operations

results of operations net income for was million  a decrease of 
million from while net interest income for united only increased  additions to the loan loss reserve in the third quarter of and expenses related to the merger of heritage bank and state bank contributed to a decrease in net income for united also incurred additional personnel and operating costs related to new branches opened in bozeman and missoula  montana and scottsdale  arizona  and expects some of these new branch expenses to be ongoing in the year net income was million in as compared to million in increased loan volumes in were the primary reason for increased interest income 
this was offset by additional interest expense due to deposit growth and additional fhlb borrowings  resulting in an increase in net interest income of 
continued loan growth and consistent rates paid on deposits resulted in a 
million increase in net income for net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the most significant component of united s earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets loans  investment securities  mortgage backed securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
this amount  when divided by average interest earning assets  is referred to as the net interest margin and expressed as a percentage 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in interest rates  the volume and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities expressed as a percentage is referred to as the net interest rate spread

as illustrated in the preceding tables  the principal reason for the increase in net interest income from to  and to  was an increase in the volume of united s interest earning assets 
the decrease in interest income in due to a planned decrease in the volume of investment securities held was more than offset by a large positive contribution from increased loan volumes  as funds from borrowings  deposits and repayments of investment securities were applied to increase the volume of higher yielding loan assets 
this increased volume of loans was largely responsible for the million increase in interest income from to the increased volume of loans and the consolidation of valley were largely responsible for the million increase in interest income from to average interest rates earned on loans increased during these periods as market interest rates increased slightly 
rates earned on investment securities decreased slightly from to and increased slightly from to rates paid on deposits remained relatively constant from to and from to  resulting in only minimal changes in interest expense as a result of changes in such rates 
an million increase in time deposit accounts from to and a million increase in short term borrowings  resulted in a million increase in interest expense from to further increases in borrowings from to  particularly in repurchase agreements and fhlb borrowings along with a million increase in time deposits  caused an increase of million in interest expense in as compared to the increased interest expense was more than offset by the increased interest income resulting from expansion of united s loan portfolio during both and united s net interest income increased million from million for to million for and increased 
million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  million of the increase in net interest income in was attributable to the consolidation of valley 
provision for loan loss 
united provided million for loan losses in compared to  in and  in million of the increase in the provision is due to the consolidation of valley 
the remainder of the increase is due to loan growth and to larger than expected additions to the loan loss reserve primarily related to the deterioration of a single loan 
the loan was made to a private company in the commercial construction industry 
collateral on the loan includes accounts receivable and equipment  and collection efforts are continuing 
the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which is considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio in accordance with gaap 
future additions to united s allowance for loan losses and any change in the related ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non performing assets are dependent upon the performance and composition of united s loan portfolio  the economy  inflation  changes in real estate values and interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward adequate reserve levels 
non interest income 
in addition to net interest income  united generates significant non interest income from a range of retail banking services  including mortgage banking activities and service charges for deposit services 
non interest income increased by 
million in to million compared to million in non interest income remained consistent in when compared to million of the increase in was due to the consolidation of valley 
the remainder of the increase was due to recognizing a million gain on the sale of servicing rights related to montana board of housing loans 
loan origination fees declined 
million during other non interest income  including servicing fees on mortgage loans  service charges and fhlb stock dividends  remained relatively constant from to loan servicing fees increased 
million in due to mortgage servicing rights recorded and also 
million from equity in income of valley 
united also recognized a small amount of gain on sale of investment securities in and non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million in  and increased 
million  or  to million in the consolidation of valley accounted for million of the increase 
exclusive of the impact of the valley consolidation  salary and employee benefit expense represented 
million of the increase and was the result of additional staffing and rate increases for existing employees 
salary and employee benefit expense  which increased 
million to million in from million in  also accounted for most of the increase in this increase was due primarily to additional staffing of loan originators and rate increases for existing employees 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased 
million to million for and increased 
million to million for from million for the principal reason for the decrease in was the additional loan loss provision in the third quarter of the principal reason for the increase in was increased income 
financial condition general 
united s total assets increased million to at december  from million at december   and increased million in from million at december  the increase in assets was primarily the result of the addition of million of assets from the consolidation of valley  a million increase in loans receivable  and a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the principal reason for the increases in was growth in united s loan portfolio  which increased million during loans receivable and loans held for sale 
net loans receivable increased million to million at december  from million at december  the consolidation of valley accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining loans receivable increase of million is a direct result of strong loan demand generated through officer call programs  increased market area and continued purchase of participation loans and lease financing loans 
the diverse loan portfolio includes real estate residential mortgages  commercial and agricultural mortgages  agricultural and commercial non mortgages  consumer loans secured by real estate  and various consumer installment loans 
the banks also purchase and participate in commercial and lease financing loans 
the banks had million of participation and purchased loans as of december  net loans receivable increased million during to million at december  nearly all loan categories continued to show steady growth  although not at the same pace as  due to increases in rates later in heritage bank sells and retains servicing for a portion of its residential real estate loans to agencies of montana such as the montana board of investments and the montana board of housing 
heritage bank recognizes mortgage servicing rights as an asset regardless of whether the servicing rights are acquired or retained on loans originated and subsequently sold 
the mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights 
in november  heritage bank entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party to sell all of its servicing rights associated with montana board of housing loans existing at november  which had outstanding principal balances of approximately million 
the sales price was of the outstanding principal balance at close of business november   or approximately  a gain on the sale of approximately  is included in other non interest income for the year ended december  at december  heritage bank has a receivable related to the sale of approximately  due in march the receivable is included in other assets in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as of december  and  the carrying value of originated servicing rights was approximately  and  respectively 
heritage bank s servicing portfolio as of december  was million and as of december  was million 
approximately million of the servicing portfolio at december  was being serviced under a short term sub servicing agreement which expires in february during  loans held for sale by united increased million to million at december  from approximately million at december  approximately million of loans were originated for sale and million of loans were sold to the secondary market during the year ending december  investment securities available for sale 
united s investment securities available for sale increased million to million during and increased million to million during the year ended december  the consolidation of valley accounted for an increase of million in in  united s purchases were approximately million while sales  maturities and calls totaled million 
united also recorded an unrealized gain in market values of approximately million in other assets 
real estate and other personal property owned increased million during to million at december  the consolidation of valley accounted for 
million of the increase 

million of the increase resulted from united transferring loans to real estate and other personal property owned 
the remainder of the increase was due to united being required by its regulators to reclassify to real estate owned a duplicate facility previously reported as premises and equipment 
at december  this duplicate facility had a net carrying value of 
million 
real estate and other personal property owned decreased 
million during as the result of the sale of an apartment complex for 
million 
restricted stock increased 
million during united purchased 
million of additional fhlb stock during and purchased million of fhlb stock during  primarily as required to support the increased scope of its operations 
united received fhlb stock dividends of 
million in the remaining increase of 
million was a result of the consolidation of valley 
premises and equipment increased million during due mainly to completing the construction of the two new heritage bank branches in missoula and bozeman  montana and the new valley bank branch in scottsdale  arizona 
this increase was offset by 
million in depreciation expense and 
million reclassified to real estate owned 
the consolidation of valley resulted in 
million increase 
premises and equipment increased million during  as the result of the construction of the two new branches in missoula and bozeman as well as computer purchases and upgrades for year compliance 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles increased million in from the increased ownership and resulting consolidation of valley 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles decreased 
million during due to amortization 
components of goodwill are currently being amortized over and years 
deposits and borrowings 
united experienced a net increase in deposits of million in  which includes a million increase from the consolidation of valley  and a net increase of million in the increase in deposits during and resulted from a combination of the application of competitive rates on all deposit offerings  and united s commitment to community banking  both of which have attracted depositors 
fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million in and million in the additional borrowings in both years  were used to fund increases in united s real estate loan portfolio  as well as to manage interest rate risk 
line of credit borrowings had a net increase of million from borrowings by ufc to fund treasury stock purchases and purchases of valley stock 
nonperforming assets 
when a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  united s policy is to contact the borrower between the th and th day of delinquency to establish a repayment schedule 
if a loan is not current  or a realistic repayment schedule is not being followed by the th day of delinquency  united will generally proceed with legal action to foreclose the property after the loan has become contractually delinquent days 
loans contractually past due days are classified as nonperforming 
however  not all loans past due days automatically result in the non accrual of interest income 
if a days past due loan has adequate collateral  or is fha insured or va guaranteed  leading to the conclusion that loss of principal and interest would likely not be realized  then interest income will continue to be accrued

adequate valuation allowances are required to be established for assets classified as substandard or doubtful in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
if an asset is classified as a loss  the institution must either establish a specific valuation allowance equal to the amount classified as loss or charge off such amount

asset liability management 
united s earnings depend to a large extent on the level of its net interest income 
net interest income depends upon the difference referred to as interest rate spread between the yield on united s loan and investment portfolios and interest earning cash balances interest earning assets  and the rates paid on its deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is further affected by the relative amounts of united s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in recent years  united s interest earning assets have exceeded interest bearing liabilities 
however  when interest earning assets decrease as a result of non accrual loans and investments in non interest earning assets  net interest income and interest rate spread also decrease and any continued decrease in the level of interest earning assets would generally result in negative impact on earnings 
one of the primary objectives of united s management has been to restructure united s balance sheet to reduce its vulnerability to changes in interest rates interest rate risk 
savings institutions historically have suffered from a mismatch in the term to maturity of their assets and liabilities  with mortgage loan assets tending to be of a much longer term than deposits  the primary liabilities of savings institutions 
in periods of rising interest rates  this mismatch can render savings institutions vulnerable to increases in costs of funds deposits and borrowings that can outstrip increases in returns on longer term fixed rate loans and investments  resulting in a decrease in positive interest rate spread and lower earnings 
several strategies have been employed by united to minimize the mismatch of asset and liability maturities 
for the past several years  heritage bank has maintained the policy of selling the majority of newly originated long term to year maturity fixed rate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
these loans are sold at their outstanding principal balance  which is the prearranged contract purchase price  and therefore  no gain or loss is realized at sale 
united promotes the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions 
united also emphasizes investment in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
when maturities of loans increase  united offsets the increased interest rate risk with matching funds and maturities with the fhlb borrowings 
the following tables provide information regarding the maturity of loans included in united s portfolio as of december  the amounts reflected in the following table give no effect to assumptions regarding loan prepayments or payoffs 
loans with variable rates of interest are classified as due when the loan principal balances are contractually due  not when the interest rate reprices

stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  up slightly from million  or of total assets  at december  at december   book value was per share 
the increase in stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of million for  offset by the payment of million in dividends on ufc s common stock  the purchase of  shares of treasury stock for 
million  and a decrease in net unrealized losses on securities of 
million 
business segment results

operating segments information  including earnings performance on an operating cash basis  is presented in the following schedule 
united allocates centrally provided services to the business segments based upon estimated usage of those services

heritage bank includes united s thrift banking operations in ten montana cities 
the bank experienced steady growth in with loans increasing million or over and deposits increasing million or 
operating cash earnings for decreased 
million from net income decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to the larger than expected addition to the reserve for loan losses for the deterioration of a single loan in the third quarter of on an operating cash basis  net interest income increased to million in  non interest income increased to million  and non interest expense increased to million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
since united s earnings depend on its level of interest rate spread  its primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk irr 
interest rate risk 
united has established a formal irr policy  and the banks have asset liability management committees and investment committees  which meet at least quarterly to review and report on management s efforts to minimize irr 
several asset liability management strategies have been employed by united to minimize its exposure to irr 
these include selling most newly originated long term fixed rate mortgages  promoting the origination and retention of loans providing for periodic interest rate adjustments  shorter terms to maturity or balloon provisions  and investing in adjustable rate or shorter term mortgage backed securities and other interest earning investments 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value 
interest rate risk sensitivity of net portfolio value npv measurement seeks to establish a methodology to measure the potential for the reduction of earnings and stockholders equity resulting from both lower net interest income nii and lower npv caused by changes in market interest rates 
npv is the difference between united s depository portfolio value and its loans receivable portfolio value 
npv thus provides a leading indicator of future potential changes in both nii and stockholders equity 
because of its asset size less than million  heritage bank falls under an ots exemption that allows utilization of an asset liability computer simulation program prepared and distributed by the ots 
the ots thrift financial report includes schedule cmr that provides detailed information about the balances  interest rates  repricing  and maturity characteristics of heritage bank s financial instruments 
by utilizing heritage bank s schedule cmr data  the ots runs computer simulations net portfolio value model utilizing ots assumptions 
heritage bank  per ots requirements  has established maximum percentage changes for npv resulting from instantaneous changes in interest rates of to basis points 
a maximum change of for an instantaneous basis point change in interest rate has been established by united 
a basis point change is used by the ots as the current interest rate sensitivity measure by which thrifts are evaluated 
heritage bank periodically reviews and makes changes to established limits for npv changes due to mergers and other market factors 
the following table demonstrates heritage bank s december  npv and the present value of total assets  npv ratio and basis point change for three instantaneous increases and the three instantaneous decreases in interest rates interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value dollars in thousands instanta net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets neous change in rates amount change change total assets npv ratio change bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp   bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp the following table demonstrates heritage bank s december  npv and the present value of total assets  npv ratio and basis point change for three instantaneous increases and the three instantaneous decreases in interest rates interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value dollars in thousands instanta net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets neous change in rates amount change change total assets npv ratio change bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp bp   bp    bp bp    bp bp    bp the preceding tables for and would indicate a decrease in npv based on three instantaneous increases and three instantaneous decreases 
this would be consistent with increasing interest rates during and total present value of total assets has increased based on asset growth in however  based on the three increases and decreases in rates  the value of total assets would also decrease based on increasing interest rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operation results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows and others 
sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that heritage bank might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
