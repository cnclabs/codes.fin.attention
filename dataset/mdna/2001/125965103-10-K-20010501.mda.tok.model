item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents part i item business general we are the largest retailer of automotive parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest retailers of such products in the united states based  in each case  on our number of stores 
as of february   we operated  stores as one fully integrated company under three brand names checker auto parts  founded in and operating in the southwestern  rocky mountain and northern plains states  schuck s auto supply  founded in and operating in the pacific northwest  and kragen auto parts  founded in and operating primarily in california 
we offer a broad selection of national brand name and private label automotive products for domestic and imported cars  vans and light trucks 
our products include new and remanufactured automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories 
most of our sales are to do it yourself customers  although our commercial sales program  focusing on sales to auto repair professionals and fleet owners  represents a significant and increasing part of our business 
our stores typically offer between  and  stock keeping units  or skus 
automotive aftermarket industry we are a retailer of aftermarket automotive products such as replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories 
the term aftermarket distinguishes our sales from those items sold as part of the original sale of a car or truck 
we believe that the automotive aftermarket for these items is growing because of increases in the size and age of the country s automotive fleet  the number of miles driven annually per vehicle  the purchase prices of new cars  the cost of replacement parts  and labor costs associated with parts  installation and maintenance 
there are many companies selling automotive aftermarket products 
we believe  however  that the industry is consolidating as national and regional specialty retail chains gain market share at the expense of smaller independent retailers and less specialized mass merchandisers 
automotive specialty retailing chains like ours  which have multiple locations in a given market area  enjoy competitive advantages in purchasing  distribution  advertising and marketing compared to most small independent retailers 
in addition  the recent significant increase in the variety of domestic and imported vehicle makes and models has increased the number of automotive replacement parts 
this makes it difficult for smaller independent retailers and less specialized mass merchandise chains to maintain inventory selection broad enough to meet customer demands 
we believe this has created a competitive advantage for us and for other automotive specialty retailing chains that have the distribution capacity and sophisticated information systems to stock and deliver a large number of products in a timely manner 
marketing and merchandising strategy our marketing and merchandising strategy is to build market share by providing a broad selection of national brand name and private label products at everyday low prices 
we offer these products at conveniently located and attractively designed stores  staffed by highly trained  efficient and courteous employees 

table of contents customer service we are a customer oriented retailer dedicated primarily to do it yourself consumers with a significant and increasing focus on commercial customers 
we try to enhance customer service by use of our sophisticated product distribution and store support systems  as well as our extensive training programs 
we believe that the recruiting  training and retention of high quality sales associates is required if our business is to be successful 
we operate training and incentive programs to encourage the development of technical expertise by our sales associates so they can effectively advise customers on product selection and use 
csk university  our sales associate development program  is dedicated to the continuous education of store associates through structured on the job training and formal classroom instruction 
the curriculum focuses on four areas of the associate s development customer service skills  basic automotive systems  advanced automotive systems  and management development 
much of the training is delivered through formal classes in training centers that are fully equipped with the same systems as are in our stores 
we believe that our training programs enable sales associates to provide a high level of service to a wide variety of customers ranging from less informed do it yourself consumers to more sophisticated purchasers requiring diagnostic advice 
we also provide continuing training programs for store managers and district managers designed to assist them in increasing store level efficiency and improving their potential for promotion 
in addition  we require periodic meetings of district and store managers to facilitate and enhance communications within our organization 
many of our current associates have passed the ase p test  a nationally recognized certification for auto parts technicians 
in order to satisfy our customers  we adopted several service initiatives including free testing of starters  alternators and batteries  free charging of batteries  installation assistance for batteries  windshield wipers and other selected products  no hassle return policies  and electronically maintained lifetime warranties  which eliminate the need for consumer record keeping 
our significant investments in associate training and store level information systems enable our in store personnel to devote more time to attending to our customers automotive needs 
product selection our stores have a broad selection of national brand name products in order to generate customer traffic and appeal to our commercial customers 
in addition  we stock a large selection of high quality private label products that appeal to value conscious customers 
each store offers an extensive product line  including automotive replacement parts such as starters  alternators  shock absorbers  mufflers  brakes  spark plugs  filters and batteries  as well as a wide variety of maintenance items  such as motor oil  lubricants  waxes  cleaners  polishes and antifreeze 
in addition  each store offers general accessories such as car stereos  alarms  trim  floor mats  tools and seat covers 
product availability our stores offer between  and  skus of national brand name and private label automotive products 
if a store does not carry a specific part  store associates are able to use our surround store inventory program to reserve the part  direct the customer to pick it up from a store in the same market or at one of our nearby depots at which point the sale is recorded 
we continue to expand and improve our delivery system and we have increased our number of strategically located priority parts depots to and increased product selection through an increased sku mix and access to our on line local warehouse network 
this has led to better customer service by making available 
table of contents up to an additional  products on a same day delivery basis to over of our stores and  additional products on a next day delivery basis to all of our stores 
this has also allowed us to increase sales to commercial accounts due to the availability of a greater number of replacement parts 
store associates are able to electronically inquire on price and availability and order parts from the priority parts depots through our electronic parts catalog and receive immediate confirmation of availability without having to make telephone inquiries 
we have classified our product mix into separate categories through a merchandising program designed to determine the optimal inventory mix at each individual store based on that store s historical sales 
we believe that we can improve store sales  gross profit margin and inventory turnover by tailoring individual store inventory mix based on historical sales patterns for each of the product categories 
pricing our pricing philosophy is that we should not lose a customer because of price 
our pricing strategy is to offer everyday low prices at each of our stores 
part of this strategy is to beat any competitor s lower price by 
as a result  we closely monitor our competitors pricing levels through our precision pricing program  which analyzes prices at the store level rather than at the market or chain level 
this initiative enables us to establish pricing levels at each store based upon that store s local market competition 
our entry level products offer excellent value by meeting standard quality requirements at low prices 
in addition  our sales associates are encouraged to offer alternative products at slightly higher price points 
these products typically provide extra features  improved performance  an enhanced warranty or are of national brand recognition 
advertising we support our marketing and merchandising strategy through print advertising  in store promotional displays and radio and television advertising 
the print advertising consists of monthly color circulars that are produced by our in house advertising department and that contain redeemable coupons 
we also advertise on radio  television and billboards primarily to reinforce our image and name recognition 
television advertising is targeted to sports programming and radio advertising is primarily aired during commuting hours 
advertising efforts include spanish language television and radio as well as bilingual store signage 
in store signs and displays are used to promote products  identify departments  and to announce store specials 
we also sponsor two national hot rod association funny cars and have been designated the official auto parts store of the nhra

diagnostic maintenance repair services through our subsidiary  automotive information systems  inc ais  we provide diagnostic vehicle repair information to automotive technicians  automotive replacement parts manufacturers  automotive test equipment manufacturers  and to the do it yourself consumer 
this allows us to provide our retail  commercial  and internet customers with high quality diagnostic information in order to assist them with correctly identifying problems and efficiently obtaining the parts they need 

table of contents ais was founded in and markets its products and services under the brand name identifix 
these products and services include technical hotlines serving more than  automotive shops  the repairtrac service bulletin  on line diagrams containing over  wiring diagrams  consulting services to automotive manufacturers  and consumer services provided through our worldwide web sites 
ais has evolved into one of the leading sources of knowledge about where and how vehicles break  and how to correctly repair those vehicles 
this extensive automotive knowledge comes from more than  calls received annually from technicians seeking diagnostic assistance for vehicle repair  our staff of over master technicians who collectively have over years of vehicle diagnostic experience  and a comprehensive on site library of factory vehicle service information 
in ais s years of operation  it has developed a customer base of more than  repair shops by providing efficient and accurate information resources for automotive diagnostics and repair 
we are committed to supporting ais s existing customer base while developing new ways to deliver information to its customers 
store operations our stores are divided into nine geographic regions southwest  rocky mountain  northwest  northern plains  southern california  coastal california  los angeles  pacific coast and northern california 
each region is administered by a regional manager  each of whom oversees seven to eleven district managers 
each of our district managers has responsibility for between and stores 
the table below sets forth  as of february   the geographic distribution of our stores and the tradenames under which they operated

table of contents our stores are generally open seven days a week  with hours from am to am am to am on sundays 
the average store employs approximately to employees  including a store manager  two assistant store managers and a staff of full time and part time employees 
store formats approximately of our stores are freestanding  with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers 
the stores  which range in size from  to  square feet  average approximately  square feet in size and offer between  and  skus 
we have three prototype store designs which are   and  square feet in size 
the store size for a given new location is selected based upon sales volume expectations determined through demographics and the detailed market analysis that we prepare as part of our site selection process

the replacement parts inventory area is fronted by a counter staffed with knowledgeable parts personnel and is equipped with our electronic parts catalog 
the remaining selling space contains gondolas for accessories and maintenance items  including oil and air filters  additives  waxes and other items  together with specifically designed shelving for batteries and  in many stores  oil products 
store growth strategy our store growth strategy is focused on our existing or contiguous markets and includes opening new stores  relocating smaller stores to larger stores at better locations  and expanding selected stores 
we have identified many of our stores smaller than  square feet as future relocation or expansion priorities 
our market strategy group  which is a part of our real estate department  utilizes a sophisticated  market based approach that identifies and analyzes potential store locations based on detailed demographic and competitive studies 
these demographic and competitive studies include analysis of population density  growth patterns  age  per capita income  vehicle traffic counts and the number and type of existing automotive related facilities  such as automotive parts stores and other competitors within a pre determined radius of the potential new location 
these potential locations are compared to our existing locations to determine opportunities for opening new stores and relocating or expanding existing stores 
we believe that the large number of small operators in our industry has enabled us to effectively pursue an opportunistic acquisition strategy 
we focus our acquisition efforts in existing markets to achieve further market penetration in a timely and cost effective manner without adding additional retail square footage  and contiguous markets to permit further leveraging of our established infrastructure over an increasing sales base 

table of contents the following table sets forth our store development activities during the periods indicated fiscal year beginning stores new stores relocated stores acquired stores closed stores including relocated stores ending stores expanded stores total new  relocated and expanded stores we believe that growth opportunities exist in our current markets and that our store growth strategy will increase our name recognition and market penetration while we benefit from economies of scale in advertising  management and distribution costs 
we opened  relocated  or expanded stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal we plan to continue our store growth strategy and expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal as of february   we had executed purchase contracts or leases for sites  were in various stages of negotiation for additional sites and had identified numerous potential additional sites for store growth 
new stores generally become profitable during the first year of operation 
commercial sales program in addition to our primary focus on serving the do it yourself consumer  we have significantly increased our marketing efforts to the commercial customer in the automotive replacement parts market 
the commercial market constitutes in excess of of the annual sales in the automotive aftermarket and is currently growing at a faster rate than the do it yourself market 
our commercial sales program  which is intended to facilitate penetration of this market  is targeted to professional mechanics  auto repair shops  auto dealers  fleet owners  mass and general merchandisers with auto repair facilities and other commercial repair outlets located near our stores 
we have made a significant commitment to this portion of our business and upgraded the information systems capabilities available to the commercial sales group 
in addition  we employ one district sales manager for approximately every five stores that have a commercial sales center 
a district sales manager is responsible for servicing existing commercial accounts and developing new commercial accounts 
in addition  at a minimum  each commercial sales center has a dedicated in store salesperson  driver and delivery vehicle 
we believe we are well positioned to effectively and profitably service commercial customers  who typically require a higher level of customer service and broad product availability 
the commercial market has traditionally been serviced primarily by jobbers 
recently  however  automotive specialty retailing chains  such as our company  have entered the commercial market 
the chains typically have multiple locations in given market areas and maintain a broad inventory selection 
we believe we have significant competitive advantages in servicing the commercial market because of our experienced sales associates  conveniently located stores  attractive pricing and ability to consistently deliver a broad product offering with an emphasis on national brand names 
as of february   we operated commercial service centers in of our stores 
our sales to commercial accounts including sales by stores without commercial service centers increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal purchasing merchandise is selected from over suppliers and purchased for all stores by personnel at our corporate headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
no one class of product and no single supplier accounted for as much as of our purchases in fiscal 
table of contents our inventory management systems include the e trim buying system  which provides inventory movement forecasting based upon history  trend and seasonality 
combined with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions  the e trim buying system determines the timing and size of purchase orders 
approximately of the dollar value of transactions are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by a computer facsimile interface 
our store replenishment system generates orders based upon store on hand and store model stock 
this includes an automatic model stock adjustment system utilizing historical sales  seasonality and store presentation requirements 
we also can allocate seasonal and promotional merchandise based upon a store s history of prior promotional and seasonal sales 
our stores offer products with nationally recognized  well advertised brand names  such as armor all  autolite  ac delco  castrol  dayco  exide  fel pro  fram  havoline  mobil  monroe  pennzoil  prestone  quaker state  raybestos  stant  sylvania  turtle wax and valvoline 
in addition to brand name products  our stores carry a wide variety of high quality private label products 
because most of our private label products are produced by nationally recognized manufacturers that produce similar brand name products that enjoy a high degree of consumer acceptance  we believe that our private label products are of a quality that is comparable to such brand name products 
gross profit margin for fiscal declined from the fiscal rate in large part due to the sell through of acquired inventory that was sold without the benefit of normal vendor allowances 
apart from this situation  we have increased our gross profit margin over the last several years primarily as a result of obtaining lower product acquisition costs  more favorable vendor terms  cash discounts from vendors  efficiencies from our warehouse and distribution system and improvements in product mix 
we believe that the improved vendor terms are primarily the result of growth in our store count and purchase volume 
warehouse and distribution our warehouse and distribution system utilizes bar coding  radio frequency scanners and sophisticated conveyor and put to light systems 
we instituted engineered labor standards and incentive programs in each of our distribution centers which have contributed to improved labor productivity 
each store is currently serviced by one of our three main distribution centers  with the regional distribution centers handling bulk materials  such as oil 
all of our merchandise is shipped by vendors to our distribution centers  with the exception of batteries  which are shipped directly to stores by the vendor 
we have sufficient warehouse and distribution capacity to meet the requirements of our growth plans for the foreseeable future 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to our three main distribution centers as of february  number number of size of stores full time distribution center area served sq

table of contents associates as of february   we employed approximately  full time associates and  part time associates 
approximately of the personnel are employed in store level operations  in distribution and in our corporate headquarters  including our call center and priority parts operation 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that our labor relations are good 
except for approximately associates located at stores in the northern california market  who have been represented by a union for many years  none of our personnel are represented by a labor union 
competition we compete principally in the do it yourself sector of the automotive aftermarket which is highly fragmented and generally very competitive 
we compete primarily with national and regional retail automotive parts chains such as autozone  inc and the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  wholesalers or jobber stores some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations  such as napa  automobile dealers and mass merchandisers that carry automotive replacement parts  maintenance items and accessories such as wal mart stores  inc 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores like ours  with multiple locations in regional markets  have competitive advantages in marketing  product selection  purchasing and distribution  as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
we believe that  as a result of these advantages  national and regional chains have been gaining market share in recent years at the expense of independent retailers and jobbers 
the principal competitive factors that affect our business are store location  customer service  product selection  availability  quality and price 
while we believe that we compete effectively in our various markets  certain competitors are larger in terms of number of stores and sales volume  have greater financial and management resources and have been operating longer in certain geographic areas 
trade names  service marks and trademarks we own and have registered the service mark schuck s with the united states patent and trademark office for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
we have the right to use the tradenames checker in connection with the automotive parts retailing business and kragen 
in addition  we own and have registered numerous trademarks with respect to many of our private label products 
we believe that our various tradenames  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy  but that our business is not otherwise dependent on any particular service mark  tradename or trademark 
there are no infringing uses known by us that materially affect the use of such marks 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of batteries and used lubricants  and regarding ownership and operation of real property 
we handle hazardous materials during our operations  and our customers may also use or bring hazardous materials onto our properties 
in addition  automobiles are serviced in automotive service facilities that we sublease to third parties 
during fiscal  we substantially exited our service center operations through closure or sublease of such facilities 
we require these automotive service facilities to dispose of certain items  including used batteries  lubricants and oils in accordance with applicable environmental regulations 
we currently provide a recycling program for batteries and for the collection of used lubricants at certain of our stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third party vendors 
the batteries and used lubricants are collected by our associates  deposited into vendor supplied containers pallets and then disposed of by the third party vendors 
our agreements with such vendors are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any harm caused by the batteries and lubricants to off 
table of contents site properties or even on site when caused by the vendor 
many of the agreements provide us with indemnification against liability that we may incur in connection with the disposal of such items 
under environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations has had a material impact on our operations to date  but there can be no assurance that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us

item legal proceedings as previously disclosed  on may   a lawsuit was filed against us in the superior court in san diego  california 
the case was brought by two former store managers and a former senior assistant manager 
it purported to be a class action for all present and former california store managers and senior assistant managers and sought overtime pay for a period beginning in may as well as injunctive relief requiring overtime pay in the future 
we were also served with two other lawsuits purporting to be class actions filed in california state courts in orange and fresno counties by thirteen other former and current employees 
we have finalized a settlement of all of these lawsuits 
the final amount of the settlement was approximately 
table of contents million which includes plaintiff s attorneys fees and costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
we believe that the settlement amount was reasonable in light of the projected legal expenses and other costs necessary to defend these lawsuits and the potential incremental exposure to us in the event of an unfavorable outcome 
we were served on march  with a complaint filed in federal court in the eastern district of new york by the coalition for a level playing field  llc and individual auto parts dealers alleging that we and seven other auto parts dealers autozone  inc  wal mart stores  inc  advance stores company  inc  discount auto  inc  the pep boys manny  moe and jack  inc  o reilly automotive  inc  and keystone automotive operations  inc violated the robinson patman act 
only of the individual plaintiffs asserted claims against us 
the complaint alleges that we and other defendants knowingly either induced or received discriminatory prices from large suppliers  allegedly in violation of section a and f of the robinson patman act  as well as received compensation from large suppliers for services not performed for those suppliers  allegedly in violation of section c of the robinson patman act 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief against all defendants and seeks treble damages on behalf of the individual auto parts dealers who are plaintiffs  plus attorneys fees 
the complaint alleges that the estimated average damage amount per plaintiff is  and more for those plaintiffs that are wholesale distributors and not simply jobbers before trebling 
we believe the suit is without merit and plan to vigorously defend it 
we  with other defendants  have filed a motion to dismiss and certain other procedural motions 
a decision on these motions is not anticipated until the second or third quarter of fiscal we do not currently believe that this complaint will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we currently and from time to time are involved in other litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
the damages claimed in some of this litigation are substantial 
although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained  we do not currently believe that  in the aggregate  they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents part ii item market for registrant s common stock and related stockholder matters our common stock has been listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cao since march  as of april   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding and there were approximately record holders of our common stock

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements include working capital primarily inventory  debt service obligations and capital expenditures 
we intend to finance our cash requirements with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at february   we had net working capital of approximately million and total liquidity cash plus availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately million 
during most of fiscal  we had access to an off balance sheet operating lease facility which was used to finance new store construction 
as of february   million had been committed  of which million had been utilized and million remained to be funded for stores not completed by december  under a similar agreement that expired on may  with respect to the addition of new stores  approximately million was used to finance new store construction 
we are currently negotiating a new lease facility and expect to have a facility in place by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we do not believe that such a lease facility is critical to our store development plans for fiscal based on the limited number of projected store openings and the availability of other alternative financing arrangements  including sale leaseback financing transactions directly with individual investors 
we have finalized an agreement to settle the class action lawsuits see note to the consolidated financial statements brought by former and present california store managers and senior assistant managers seeking overtime pay under california law 
the amount of the settlement is approximately million which includes plaintiff s attorneys fees and costs and will be paid in april and may the settlement will be funded through the revolving credit facility 

table of contents in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the largest component of the change in cash flow from operating activities relates to our investment in inventories  where million of cash was used during fiscal compared to million used for such purposes during fiscal the decrease in inventories reflects the sell through  return to vendors or other disposition of inventories obtained in acquisitions and reduced inventory levels as a result of cost containment 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of million used in the big wheel  aga and ais acquisitions during fiscal and a lower level of capital expenditures in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in  we used million of net borrowings under the senior credit facility to fund investing activities and made payments of million on capital lease obligations 
in  we used million of net borrowings under the senior credit facility primarily relating to the big wheel  aga and ais acquisitions  incurred million of debt issuance costs and made payments of million on capital lease obligations 
we expect to spend approximately million during fiscal for capital expenditures  including new store fixtures and information systems hardware and software 
our debt service requirements in include scheduled principal reductions of approximately million  million of principal payments under capital lease obligations and associated annual interest 
we believe that cash flow from operations combined with the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support our operations and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
store acquisitions on april   we acquired the allcar stores 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid approximately  in cash  which includes associated transaction costs  for the assets of allcar and assumed vendor accounts payable and certain indebtedness and accrued expenses 
in august  we made a payment of approximately  pursuant to a purchase price adjustment formula contained in the original agreement 
in addition  we may be required to make an additional payment in of approximately  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the allcar stores are serviced out of our mendota heights distribution center and have been converted to the checker name and store format and integrated into our operations 
in connection with our acquisitions and the acquisition of the allcar stores  we incurred one time transition and integration expenses of approximately million during fiscal  consisting primarily of grand opening advertising  training and re merchandising costs 
in addition  during fiscal  we incurred million of capital expenditures  consisting primarily of expenditures related to equipment  store fixtures  signage and the installation of our store level information systems in these stores 
we do not anticipate any significant transition and integration expenses or capital expenditures relating to these acquisitions during fiscal expansion we opened new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal and new  relocated or expanded stores in fiscal we expect to open  relocate or expand approximately stores in fiscal we anticipate that the majority of these new  relocated or expanded stores will be financed under arrangements structured as operating leases that require no net capital expenditures except for fixtures and store equipment 
for the remainder of our planned new  relocated or expanded stores  we expect to spend approximately  per store for leasehold improvements 
in addition to capital expenditures  each new store will require an estimated investment in working capital  principally for inventories  of approximately  new stores generally become profitable during the first full year of operations 

table of contents store closing costs we provide an allowance for estimated costs and losses to be incurred in connection with store closures 
for stores to be closed  such costs are recognized when a store is specifically identified  costs can be estimated and closure is planned to be completed within the next twelve months prior to january   within eighteen months 
for stores to be relocated  such costs are recognized when an agreement for the new location has been reached with a landlord and site plans meet preliminary municipal approvals 
the allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying financial statements  and consists primarily of future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreement for stores  net of estimated sub lease recoveries 
future rents will be incurred through the expiration of the non cancelable leases  the longest of which runs through march activity in the provision for store closings and the related store closing costs for the three fiscal years ended february   is as follows in thousands fiscal year balance  beginning of year store closing costs store closing costs  gross adjustments to prior year plans revisions in estimates store closing costs  net purchase accounting adjustments big wheel al s and grand auto supply total purchase accounting adjustments payments balance  end of year during the period that they remain open for business  the rent and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed continue to be reflected in our normal operating expenses 
as a result of the aga acquisition  we analyzed our store locations in california and the pacific northwest 
we closed or relocated of the former aga stores of which were closed as of january  based on several factors including market saturation  store profitability  and store size and format 
costs associated with these closures have been considered in our final purchase price allocation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we finalized a store closure plan for our own stores that overlap with aga stores  which resulted in pre tax charges of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the charges consist of two components future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the lease agreements for the stores net of estimated sub lease recoveries  and write down of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets associated with the stores 
adjustments to prior plans relate to costs for store closures that were accrued in prior years but withdrawn from our store closure plan in the year of adjustment 
such withdrawals are due to subsequent improvements in the underlying economics of the store s performance or in the case of store relocation because we were unable to secure a previously identified site upon acceptable lease terms 
we had significant adjustments to prior year plans in because of changes resulting from improved performance at certain stores scheduled for closure in further significant changes to the strategic plan are not considered likely 
all relocations and store closings are anticipated to be completed within twelve months of accrual and only after costs can be estimated 
other cost revisions are comprised of changes in expected future rental costs for vacant or sub leased store locations  which are due largely to early terminations of lease agreements 

table of contents as part of the purchase price allocation for the aga and big wheel stores see note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded an allowance for the costs of closing or relocating certain stores 
on a store count basis  activity and the remaining number of stores to be closed are summarized as follows number of stores to be closed store count by beginning plan balance to fiscal year balance stores added amendments stores closed be closed at february   there were stores remaining to be closed under our store closing plans  comprised of the following store count by stores in plan balance to year of accrual closing plan amendments stores closed be closed service centers as a result of our acquisitions and the allcar acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired automobile service centers 
the majority of these centers are adjacent or attached to existing retail stores and perform automotive maintenance as well as tire sales and service 
during fiscal  we substantially exited the service center business as it required management experience that is not consistent with our core business operations  required human and financial resources better utilized in our retail and commercial operations  and did not allow us sufficient economies of scale to achieve required profitability 
in conjunction with our plan  during fiscal we closed centers and during fiscal we sublet centers and closed centers 
the one remaining center was subleased during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  these centers generated net sales of approximately million and pre tax operating losses of approximately million 
quarterly results and seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters 
our business is  in addition  affected by weather conditions 
while unusually severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales as our customers tend to defer elective maintenance during such periods  extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal products to increase 
the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

net income in the first quarter of fiscal was negatively affected by a million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of a million benefit for income taxes  as a result of a change in the accounting literature with respect to the timing of recognition for store pre opening expenses 
the sum of the quarterly earnings loss per share amounts within a fiscal year may differ from the total earnings loss per share for the fiscal year due to the impact of differing weighted average share outstanding calculations 

table of contents inflation we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we believe that we will be able to mitigate the effects of future merchandise cost increases principally through economies of scale resulting from increased volumes of purchases  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
interest earned on our cash equivalents as well as interest paid on our variable rate debt are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
our variable rate debt relates to borrowings under our senior credit facility  which is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of our senior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations 
our exposure to interest rate risk increased during fiscal due to increases in corresponding interest rates as well as increased debt balances in conjunction with our recent acquisitions 
we currently utilize no derivative financial instruments that expose us to significant market risk 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  we believe the exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our financial position or results of operations
