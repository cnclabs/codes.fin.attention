overview shoe pavilion is the largest independent off price footwear retailer on the west coast that offers a broad selection of women s and men s designer label and name brand merchandise 
the company was among the first footwear retailers on the west coast to expand the off price concept into the designer and name brand footwear market 
as of december  the company operated retail stores in california  washington  oregon and oklahoma  of which operated under the trade name shoe pavilion 
in addition  as of december   the company operated the shoe department of gordmans  inc formerly richman gordman price stores  inc department stores in colorado  illinois  iowa  kansas  missouri  nebraska  oklahoma and south dakota under a licensing agreement entered into in july the company opened  net of closures  stores in  new stores in  and stores in during  the company intends to open approximately to new stores  including leased shoe departments  primarily in its existing markets 
it also expects to close to stores in the company s growth in net sales historically has resulted primarily from the opening of new stores 
in and the company also experienced growth in net sales as a result of the opening of shoe departments pursuant to a licensing agreement entered into with gordmans in the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth will continue to be new store openings 
because the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely  the company does not expect that comparable store sales will contribute significantly to future growth in net sales 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store sales increased in  decreased in and increased in the company believes that the decline in comparable store sales was due in part to unusual weather patterns causing delays in normal seasonal sales  the high same store sales comparisons from the prior year  the rapid expansion into the licensed stores causing delays in replenishments to the existing stores  and an overall soft footwear environment exacerbated by several prominent store liquidations which dictated more promotional activity by the company 
the company seeks to acquire footwear merchandise on favorable financing terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth 
this strategy causes an increase in inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  the company s inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 
because of the substantial increase in net sales  inventory levels increased from million at january  to million at december  prior to its initial public offering in february  shoe pavilion was treated as an s corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes since august as a result  the company s earnings from august through february  were taxed  with certain exceptions  directly to the company s sole stockholder rather than to the company 
the company s s corporation status terminated on february   and the company is now subject to state and federal income taxes as a c corporation 
in connection with its conversion to c corporation status  the company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit of  the pro forma adjustments reflect federal and state income taxes as if the company had not elected s corporation status for income tax purposes

factors affecting financial performance in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating an investment in the shares of common stock of the company 
the statements contained in this form k which are not historical facts are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
risks associated with expansion the company has experienced rapid and substantial growth in net sales as well as in its employee base 
the company s continued growth will depend to a significant degree on its ability to expand its operations through the opening of new stores and to operate these stores on a profitable basis 
the success of the company s planned expansion will be significantly dependent upon the company s ability to locate suitable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms 
in addition  several other factors could affect the company s ability to expand  including the adequacy of the company s capital resources  the ability to hire  train and integrate employees and the ability to adapt the company s distribution and other operational systems 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its planned expansion or that any such expansion will be profitable 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s expansion within its existing markets will not adversely affect the individual financial performance of the company s existing stores or its overall operating results  or that new stores will achieve net sales and profitability levels consistent with existing stores 
to manage its planned expansion  the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its existing systems and procedures  including product distribution facilities  store management  financial controls and management information systems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will anticipate all of the changing demands that expanded operations may impose on such systems 
failure to adapt its distribution capabilities or other internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company actively monitors individual store performance and has closed underperforming stores in the past  including five in eight in and two in the company intends to continue to close underperforming stores in the future  and if it were to close a number of stores  it could incur significant closure costs and reductions in net sales 
in certain instances  the company may be unable to close an underperforming store on a timely basis because of lease terms 
a significant increase in closure costs or the inability to close one or more underperforming stores on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
license agreement in july  the company entered into a license agreement to operate the shoe department of gordmans  inc department stores located in the midwest 
the initial term of the agreement shall expire  unless terminated sooner as provided by the agreement  on june  upon the expiration of the initial term  the agreement shall automatically renew for an additional term of three years  expiring on july  unless either the company or gordmans gives the other party written notice on or before january   that they do not intend to renew the agreement 
the company operated shoe departments of gordmans at december  there can be no assurance that the agreement will not be terminated before the expiration of its initial term or that the agreement will be renewed after the expiration of its initial term 
early termination of the agreement or failure of either party to renew the agreement could adversely affect the company s net sales  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory and sourcing risk the company s future success will be significantly dependent on its ability to obtain merchandise that consumers want to buy  particularly name brand merchandise with long term retail appeal  and to acquire such merchandise under favorable terms and conditions 
in  the company s top ten suppliers accounted for approximately of inventory purchases 
the deterioration of the company s relationship with any key vendor could result in delivery delays  merchandise shortages or less favorable terms than the company currently enjoys 
the company deals with its suppliers on an order by order basis and has no long term purchase contracts or other contractual assurances of continued supply or pricing 
as the company s operations expand  its demand for off price inventory will continue to increase 
the company s footwear purchases typically involve manufacturing over runs  over orders  mid or late season deliveries or last season s stock 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient supply of readily salable  high margin inventory  to negotiate favorable discount and payment agreements with its suppliers or to sell large inventory purchases without markdowns could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business sourcing and purchasing 
reliance on key personnel the company s future success will be dependent  to a significant extent  on the efforts and abilities of its executive officers 
the loss of the services of any one of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company s continued growth will depend  in part  on its ability to attract  motivate and retain skilled managerial and merchandising personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain a substantial percentage of its existing personnel or attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
uncertainty of future operating results  fluctuations in comparable store sales although the company has been profitable  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to remain profitable 
future operating results will depend upon many factors  including general economic conditions  the level of competition and the ability of the company to acquire sufficient inventory  achieve its expansion plans and effectively monitor and control costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s recent gross margin levels will be sustainable in the future 
although the company achieved a substantial portion of its net sales growth through the licensing agreement with gordmans  historically its growth in net sales has resulted primarily from new store openings 
at the present time  the company expects that the primary source of future sales growth will be from new store openings 
historically  the company s comparable store sales have fluctuated widely  and the company does not expect that comparable store sales will contribute significantly to future growth in net sales 
the company defines comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
the company s comparable store sales increased in  decreased in and increased in risks associated with possible acquisitions the company may pursue the acquisition of companies and assets that complement its existing business 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks  including the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the company has limited experience in identifying  completing and integrating acquisitions 
the company does not have any current plans to acquire any other companies  and there can be no assurance that the company will identify attractive acquisition candidates  that acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms or that any acquired companies will be integrated successfully into the company s operations 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and net income 
historically  net sales and net income have been weakest during the first quarter 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including timing of new store openings  the level of net sales contributed by new stores  merchandise mix the timing and level of price markdowns  availability of inventory  store closures  advertising costs  competitive pressures and changes in the demand for off price footwear 
any such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
dependence on consumer spending and preferences the success of the company s operations depends upon a number of general economic factors relating to consumer spending  including employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  inflation and taxation 
there can be no assurance that consumer spending will not decline in response to economic conditions  thereby adversely affecting the company s operating results 
all of the company s products are subject to changing consumer preferences 
consumer preferences could shift to types of footwear other than those that the company currently offers 
any such shift could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s future success will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate effectively or respond to such changes on a timely basis or at all 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to  among other things  lower net sales  excess inventory and lower gross margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
international purchasing the company purchases in season name brand and branded design merchandise directly from factories in italy  brazil  china and spain 
directly sourced goods accounted for approximately and of net sales in and  respectively 
the company has no long term contracts with direct manufacturing sources and competes with other companies for production facilities 
all of the manufacturers with which the company conducts business are located outside of the united states  and the company is subject to the risks generally associated with an import business  including foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements  disruptions or delays in shipments and the risks associated with united states import laws and regulations  including quotas  duties  taxes  tariffs and other restrictions 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not disrupt the company s supply of directly sourced goods or otherwise adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
see item business sourcing and purchasing 
inventory shrinkage the retail industry is subject to theft by customers and employees 
because the company uses a self service format  where shoppers have access to both shoes of a pair  the company must maintain substantial store security 
although the company has implemented enhanced security procedures  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer from significant inventory shrinkage in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition the retail footwear market is highly competitive  and the company expects the level of competition to increase 
the company competes with off price and discount retailers eg  nordstrom rack  payless shoesource  ross  dress for less and famous footwear  branded retail outlets eg  nine west  national retail stores eg  nordstrom  marshalls  macy s  sears  eg penney  loehmann s  robinsons may and mervyn s  traditional shoe stores and mass merchants 
many of these competitors have stores in the markets in which the company now operates and in which it plans to expand 
many of the company s competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in the future new participants will not enter the off price segment of the footwear market 
competitive pressures resulting from competitors pricing policies could materially adversely affect the company s gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face greater competition from other national  regional or local retailers or that the company will be able to compete successfully with existing and new competitors 
the inability of the company to respond to such competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
future capital needs the company expects that anticipated cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent that the foregoing cash resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  including new store openings planned for  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent the company s planned expansion  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantial control by single stockholder dmitry beinus  the company s chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
as a result  mr 
beinus is able to decide all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
concentration of stock ownership could also have the effect of preventing a change in control of the company 
possible volatility of stock price the company s common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations  either of which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to the operating performance of the company 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  fluctuations in the company s comparable store sales  announcements by other footwear retailers  the failure of the company s earnings to meet the expectations of investors  as well as other events or factors 
on march  the company received a nasdaq staff determination indicating that the company had failed to comply with the minimum market value of public float requirement for continued listing set forth in marketplace rule a the rule  and that its shares  therefore  were subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
the company has requested a hearing before a nasdaq listing qualifications panel to review the staff determination 
the hearing is scheduled for april  the hearing request has stayed the delisting of the company s common stock pending the panel s decision 
there can be no assurance the panel will grant the company s request for continued listing 
in order to maintain a minimum market value of public float of million and be in compliance with the rule  the  shares of the company s common stock included in the public float would need to trade at approximately per share for a minimum of consecutive trading days 
if the panel does not grant the company s request for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  the company intends to apply for listing of its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the company currently satisfies the requirements for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market
