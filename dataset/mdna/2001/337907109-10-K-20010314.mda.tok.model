item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s results of operations are primarily affected by its levels of net interest income  provisions for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense and income taxes 
the company s results are strongly influenced by the southern california economy in which it operates 
net earnings of million or per share were recorded in  compared to net earnings of million or per share in and net earnings of million or per share in all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis and have been adjusted for the two for one stock split declared june  the increase in net earnings from to was due to higher net interest income  which resulted from growth in interest earning assets 
the decrease in net earnings from to was attributable to the million loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes resulting from the redemption of the company s million senior unsecured notes 
no loan loss provision was recorded in or  but a million provision was recorded in the southern california economy and real estate market has remained strong over the last few years 
as a result  net loan charge offs declined from million in to million in net loan loss recoveries totaling thousand were recorded during certain key financial ratios for the company are presented below average return on return on equity to average average average assets equity assets non performing assets primarily loans days past due or in foreclosure plus foreclosed real estate decreased to million or of total assets as of december  from to million or of total assets at december  and million or of total assets at december  the decreasing amount of real estate owned over the last several years is due to lower balances of delinquent loans and decreased foreclosures in the improved southern california real estate markets 
the company repurchased common shares totaling  and  during and  respectively 
as of february    shares remain eligible for repurchase under the compan s authorized repurchase program 
no additional shares have been purchased thus far during at december  the bank s regulatory risk based capital ratio was and its tangible and core capital ratios were 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards necessary to be deemed well capitalized at december  the bank s deposits are insured by the saif up to a maximum of  for each insured depositor 
the bank s fdic insurance premiums were thousand during and million during both and the lower premiums paid in were due to a drop in the deposit insurance assessment rate from basis points in and basis points in to basis points in  due to an improvement in the bank s regulatory rating 
risks and uncertainties in the normal course of business  the company encounters two significant types of risk economic risk and regulatory risk 
economic risk there are two main components of economic risk credit risk and market risk which includes interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of default in the company s loan portfolio that results from a borrower s inability to make contractually required payments 
see loan loss provisions and non performing assets 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of real estate collateral are based on estimates that are susceptible to changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
no loan loss provision was recorded during a downward turn in the current economic climate could increase the likelihood of losses due to credit risks 
this could create the need for additional loan loss provisions 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and interest rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
see asset liability management for additional information relating to market risk 
regulatory risk regulatory risk is the risk that the regulators will reach different conclusions than management regarding the financial position of the company 
the ots examines the bank s financial results annually 
the ots reviews the allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to adjust the allowance based on information available at the time of their examination 
other risks inflation inflation substantially impacts the financial position and operations of financial intermediaries  such as banks and savings institutions 
these entities primarily hold monetary assets and liabilities and  as such  can experience significant purchasing power gains and losses over relatively short periods of time 
in addition  interest rate changes during inflationary periods change the amounts and composition of assets and liabilities held by financial intermediaries and could result in regulatory pressure for an additional equity investment 
pending lawsuits the bank has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits  none of which is expected to have a materially adverse effect on the company 
components of earnings net interest income net interest income is the primary component of the company s earnings 
the chief determinants of net interest income are the dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid thereon 
the greater the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities  the more beneficial the impact on net interest income 
the excess of average interest earning assets over average interest bearing liabilities was million in  million in and million in the increase over the last two years was due to improvement in asset quality and asset growth 
the company s net interest income is also impacted by a three month time lag before changes in the cost of funds can be passed along to monthly adjustable rate loan customers 
savings and borrowing costs adjust to market rates immediately while it takes several months for the loan yield to adjust 
this time lag decreases the company s net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates 
see asset liability management for further discussion 
the following table sets forth the components of interest earning assets and liabilities  the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities  the yields earned and rates paid and net interest income for the periods indicated dollars in thousands average loans and mortgage backed securities    average investment securities    average interest earning assets    average savings deposits    average borrowings    average interest bearing liabilities    excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities    yields earned on average interest earning assets rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread effective net spread total interest income    total interest expense

loss provision the company did not record a loan loss provision during or but recorded a loan loss provision of million in no provision was recorded during the last two years because  based on analysis done by management  existing allowances were sufficient to cover the credit risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
non performing assets decreased to million in from million in and million in due to improvement in the economy and real estate markets in which the bank operates 
the bank has a policy of providing for general valuation allowances  unallocated to any specific loan  but available to offset any loan losses 
the allowance is maintained at an amount that management believes adequate to cover estimable and probable loan losses 
the company also maintains valuation allowances for impaired loans and loans sold with recourse 
see allowances for loan losses 
management performs regular risk assessments of the bank s loan portfolio to maintain appropriate valuation allowances 
additional loan loss provisions may be required to the extent that charge offs are recorded against the valuation allowance for impaired loans  the general valuation allowance  or the valuation allowance for loans sold with recourse 
the company recorded net loan loss recoveries of thousand during this compares with net loan charge offs totaling million in and million in the recoveries recorded during resulted from cash payments by borrowers on loans that had been previously charged off 
the charge offs during represented of average loans outstanding and the charge offs during represented of average loans outstanding 
charge offs primarily result from declines in the value of the underlying collateral of the non performing loans 
non interest income loan servicing and other fees were million in  million in and million in the lower fees earned over the last three years are the result of decreased fees earned on loans serviced for other lenders 
fees earned during and included adjustments of thousand and million  respectively  to provide for impairment of the bank s servicing asset 
these provisions were due to accelerated payoffs and prepayments of loans serviced for others 
also  late charge and prepayment penalty fees decreased in compared to gain on sale of loans was thousand in  million in and million in the decrease in gain on sale of loans is due to a reduction in loans originated for sale in the rising interest rate environment for fixed rate mortgages during the second half of and throughout real estate operations resulted in a net gain of thousand in  million in and million in real estate operations include gain on sale of foreclosed properties  operational income and expenses during the holding period  and recoveries of prior losses on real estate sold 
non interest expense the ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was compared with for the decrease from to is mostly attributable to decreases in legal expenses and federal deposit insurance  offset by additional expenses associated with goodwill amortization and increased data processing costs 
salary and benefit costs were approximately the same during and increases in compensation and incentive costs during were offset by a decrease in bonus and other benefit costs during the same year 
salary and benefit costs increased in compared to due to higher salary costs  incentive costs and bonus expenses 
occupancy expense increased slightly in compared to due to the acquisition of two branches from another financial institution 
one branch was closed and its deposits were transferred to one of the acquired branches 
occupancy expense decreased in compared to because expense included market adjustments on leased properties no longer occupied by the bank 
other operating expenses increased slightly in compared to due to increases in data processing costs associated with the creation of the bank s new web page and internet site 
also  goodwill amortization increased substantially to million in from thousand in due to the write off of goodwill associated with the closed branch and a re evaluation of goodwill on a second branch location 
in contrast  legal expenses decreased substantially from million in to thousand in in  other operating expenses increased to million from million in due to an increase in legal costs to million in from million in the increase in legal expenses during was the result of higher than normal defense cases that were resolved during that year 
offsetting the increase in legal costs during was a decrease in data processing cost to million in from million in data processing costs were inflated due to the bank s conversion to a new computer system during that year

balance sheet analysis consolidated assets at the end of were billion  representing a increase from billion at the end of and a increase from billion at the end of assets have increased over the last two years due to strong loan originations  which totaled billion in and million in year originations included million in loan purchases and originations included loan purchases of million 
loan portfolio at the end of  over of the bank s loans had adjustable interest rates based on monthly changes in the index 
as part of its asset liability management strategy  the bank has maintained the level of adjustable loans in its portfolio at over for several years 
management believes that the high level of adjustable rate mortgages will help insulate the bank from fluctuations in interest rates  notwithstanding the several month time lag between a change in its monthly cost of funds and a corresponding change in its loan yields 
see asset liability management 
the bank also originates loans with initial fixed interest rates with periods ranging from to years 
by policy  the bank will either match the fixed rate period of these loans with borrowings for the same term or will hold an amount up to million of unmatched fixed rate loans in its portfolio 
management believes that the limited origination of fixed rate loans will enhance the company s overall return on assets and improve loan origination in this economy 
loans originated under this limited program totaled million in compared to million in in  and  the bank placed million  million and million  respectively  in mortgages with other lenders under fee arrangements  which amount is not included in loan originations 
in  loans made on the security of single family properties one to four units comprised of the dollar amount of new loan originations 
loans made on the security of multi family properties five or more units comprised of new originations 
loans made on the security of commercial real estate properties comprised of new loan originations 
business loans originated by the commercial lending units totaled million 
adjustable rate mortgages comprised of new loan activity during compared with during and in the following table details loan originations and loan purchases by loan type for the periods indicated loan originations and purchases by type year ended december  dollars in thousands single family one to four units      multi family      commercial real estate 
    commercial business loans    other   total      loans originated upon the sale of the bank s real estate owned were thousand or 
of total originations in all of these loans were originated based on the security of multi family properties 
from time to time  the bank converts loans into mortgage backed securities for use in securitized borrowings reverse repurchase agreements 
no loans were converted into mortgage backed securities during  or securitized loans have a lower risk weighting for regulatory risk based capital purposes 
in exchange for the enhanced credit risk associated with mortgage backed securities  the bank pays guarantee fees to fhlmc and or fnma 
the bank s adjustable rate loan products often provide for first year monthly payments that are lower than the fully indexed interest and principal due 
any interest not fully paid by such lower first year payments is added to the principal balance of the loan 
this causes negative amortization until payments increase to cover interest and principal repayment shortfalls 
due to negative amortization  loan to value ratios may increase above those calculated at the inception of the loan 
the bank does not normally lend in excess of of the appraised collateral value on adjustable mortgage loans amls 
where the bank does lend in excess of of the appraised value  additional fees and rates are charged 
mortgage insurance is required on loans in excess of or premium rates and or fees are charged if the mortgage insurance requirement is waived 
subsequent to the origination of a loan  the bank may purchase private mortgage insurance with its own funds 
loans originated under this program for which there is no private mortgage insurance totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  see business interest rates  terms and fees 
loan composition loans based on the security of single family properties one to four units comprise the largest category of the bank s loan portfolio including mortgage backed securities 
the loan portfolio also includes loans secured by multi family and commercial properties 
at december   approximately of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio consisted of first liens on single family properties 
first liens on multi family properties comprised approximately of the portfolio  and first liens on commercial properties represented approximately of the portfolio 
commercial business loans and consumer loans represent less than of the loan portfolio as of december  multi family and commercial real estate loans are considered more susceptible to market risk than single family loans and higher interest rates and fees are charged to borrowers for these loans 
approximately of loan originations in were multi family loans compared to in and in multi family loans originated upon the sale of reo were  and of total loan originations during  and  respectively 
the bank has loss exposure on certain loans sold with recourse 
these loans are substantially all secured by multi family properties 
loans sold with recourse totaled million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  although no longer owned by the bank  these loans are evaluated for the purposes of computing the repurchase liability and measuring risk exposure for regulatory capital 
under the bank s current policy  it no longer enters into loans sold with recourse agreements

the bank s general valuation allowances  repurchase liability for loans sold with full or limited recourse 
assets with loss exposure include the bank s loan portfolio plus loans sold with recourse  but exclude mortgage backed securities 
non performing assets non performing assets  as defined by the bank  include loans delinquent over days or in foreclosure  real estate acquired in settlement of loans  and other loans less than days delinquent but for which collectibility is questionable

the decrease in non performing loans for the last several years is due to reductions in delinquent loans and non performing loans due to continued strength in the southern california real estate markets 
single family non performing loans are primarily due to factors such as layoffs and decreased incomes 
multi family and commercial non performing loansare attributable primarily to factors such as declines in occupancy rates and decreased real estate values 
the bank actively monitors the status of all non performing loans 
impaired loans totaled million  million and million  net of related allowances of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
see business risk elements for a further discussion of impaired loans 
the bank s modified loans result primarily from temporary modifications of principal and interest payments 
under these arrangements  loan terms are typically reduced to no less than a required monthly interest payment 
any loss of revenues under the modified terms would be immaterial to the bank 
if the borrower is unable to return to scheduled principal and interest payments at the end of the modification period  foreclosure procedures are initiated  or  in certain circumstances  the modification period is extended 
as of december   the bank had modified loans totaling million  net of loan loss allowances of million 
this compares with million and million  net of allowances  as of december  and december   respectively 
modified loans included as impaired loans totaled million  million and million  net of valuation allowances  as of december   and  respectively 
no modified loans were days or more delinquent as of december   or allowances for loan losses for an analysis of the changes in the loan loss allowances  see business risk elements 
at december   the general valuation allowance was million or of the bank s loans with loss exposure 
this compares to at the end of and at the end of in addition to the general valuation allowance and the allowance for impaired loans mentioned above  the bank also maintains a repurchase liability for loans sold with recourse 
this repurchase liability amounted to  and of loans sold with recourse at december   and  respectively 
management considers the current level of loss allowances adequate to cover the bank s loss exposure at this time 
however  there can be no assurance that future additions to loan loss allowances will not be required 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity requirements federal regulations currently require a savings institution to maintain a monthly average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances and specified united states government  state or federal agency obligations equal to at least of i the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter or ii the ending balance of its net withdrawable accounts as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter 
the liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount within the range of to of such accounts and borrowings depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of member institutions 
effective december   the ots reduced this liquidity requirement to from 
the ots also gave institutions the option of using a quarterly average calculation or an end of quarter calculation of the liquidity base and removed the requirement of maintaining a monthly average balance of short term liquid assets equal to at least of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet these liquidity ratio requirements 
the bank s liquidity ratio for the quarter ended december  was  which exceeded the applicable requirements 
external sources of funds external sources of funds include savings deposits  loan sales  advances from the fhlbsf and reverse repurchase agreements reverse repos 
for purposes of funding asset growth  the source or sources of funds with the lowest total cost for the desired term are generally selected 
the incremental source of funds used most often during and was advances from the fhlbsf 
deposits obtained from national brokerage firms brokered deposits are considered a source of funds similar to a borrowing 
in evaluating brokered deposits as a source of funds  the cost of these deposits  including commission fees  is compared to other funding sources 
brokered deposits were million at december  this compares to million at december  and million at december  deposits at retail savings offices were billion as of december  compared to billion at december and billion at december  the retail deposits have increased only slightly over the last three years due to the availability of alternative investments paying higher returns to customers and intense competition for deposits by other financial institutions 
the bank also solicits deposits through telemarketing efforts 
telemarketing deposits are obtained by the bank s employees via telephone  from depositors outside of the bank s normal service areas 
telemarketing deposits decreased by to million at the end of this compares with million at the end of and million at the end of the level of telemarketing deposits varies based on the activity of investors  who are typically professional money managers 
the availability of telemarketing deposits also varies based on the investors perception of the ban s creditworthiness 
reverse repurchase agreements are short term borrowings secured by mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of and million at the end of borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements have decreased over the last three years due to prepayments of the underlying collateral 
the bank has not securitized any mortgage loans for use in collateralized borrowings for several years 
fhlb advances increased to billion at the end of from billion at the end of and million at the end of fhlb advances increased during and because these were often the lowest cost source funds available to the bank and this funding source was used most often to fund new loan growth 
loan sales were million in this compares to million during and million during loan sales decreased substantially in and due to increased interest rates on fixed rate mortgages during the second half of and during  which resulted in a decrease in demand for year and year fixed rate loans  which are only originated by the bank for sale 
internal sources of funds internal sources of funds include scheduled loan principal payments  loan payoffs  and positive cash flows from operations 
principal payments were million in compared to million in and million in principal payments include both amortization and prepayments and are a function of real estate activity and the general level of interest rates 
prepayment activity was very high in due to refinancing activity into fixed rate loans  which were available to borrowers at favorable interest rates for the first half of the decrease in prepayments during compared to is due to higher interest rates on fixed rate loans that decreased refinancing activity 
capital requirements current ots regulatory capital standards require that the bank maintain tangible capital of at least of total assets  core capital of of total assets  and risk based capital of of total assets  risk weighted 
among other things  failure to comply with these capital standards will result in restrictions on asset growth and necessitate the preparation of a capital plan  subject to regulatory approval 
generally  any institution with a risk based capital ratio in excess of and a core capital ratio greater than is considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
institutions who maintain this capital level can take in brokered deposits at their discretion  and if they achieve a sufficient ranking on their regulatory examination  may be assessed a lower deposit insurance rate 
management presently intends to maintain its capital position at levels above those required by regulators to ensure operating flexibility and growth capacity for the bank 
the bank s capital position is actively monitored by management 
the bank met the regulatory capital standards to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the various regulatory measures of capital including the prompt corrective action regulations 
to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action requirements the bank must maintain the capital ratios as set forth in the table below december  amount dollars in thousands core capital requirement  bank s core capital  excess core capital  tier risk based capital requirement  bank s tier risk based capital 
 excess tier risk based capital  risk based capital requirement  bank s risk based capital  excess risk based capital  asset liability management the bank s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and capital  while  at the same time  adjusting the bank s asset liability mix to achieve the most favorable impact on earnings 
the bank s asset liability management policy is designed to improve the balance between the maturities and repricings of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in order to better insulate net earnings from interest rate fluctuations 
under this program  the bank emphasizes the funding of monthly adjustable mortgages with short term savings and borrowings and matching the maturities of these assets and liabilities 
the bank also match funds a limited amount of fixed rate loans with initial fixed interest periods ranging from to years 
the majority of the bank s assets are monthly adjustable rate mortgages with interest rates that fluctuate based on changes in the fhlbsf eleventh district cost of funds index index 
these mortgages constitute over of the loan portfolio at the end of comparisons over the last several years show that a change in the bank s cost of funds generally correlates with changes in the index 
the bank does not use any futures  options or swaps in its asset liability strategy 
assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing are considered rate sensitive 
the mis match in the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities is referred to as a company s gap 
the gap is positive if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
generally  a positive gap benefits a company during periods of increasing interest rates 
the reverse is true during periods of decreasing interest rates 
however  because the index lags changes in market interest rates by three months while the bank s short term savings and borrowing costs adjust immediately  the bank s net interest income initially decreases during periods of rising interest rates and increases during periods of declining interest rates 
in order to minimize the impact of rate fluctuations on earnings  management s goal is to keep the one year gap at less than of total assets positive or negative 
at december   the company s one year gap was million or of total assets 
this compares with positive gap ratios of and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
another measure of interest rate risk  that is required to be performed by ots regulated institutions  is an analysis specified by ots thrift bulletin tb a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities  and derivatives activities 
under this regulation  which became effective december  and replaced tb  institutions are required to establish limits on the sensitivity of their net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
in addition  the bank monitors the impact of the same changes in interest rates on its interest income 
the following table shows the estimated impact of a parallel shift in interest rates on the bank s portfolio value at december  and december  percentage change in interest rates change in net portfolio value in basis points the percentage change represents the projected change in the net portfolio value of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities 
the percentage change in net portfolio value is affected by many different factors 
while the bank s exposure to interest rate risk has not changed significantly since  a combination of factors resulted in net portfolio values as of december  that were lower than those as of december  the mix of funding sources used to fund the bank s asset growth during was different from that used during additionally  as of december   certain loans within the bank s loan portfolio had reached lifetime floors in the decreasing interest rate scenarios 
however  due to higher interest rates  no floors were reached in the december  calculations 
as a result  lower net portfolio values were calculated for december  compared to december  the following chart shows the interest sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities by repricing period at december  and the consolidated gap position as a percentage of total assets at that time interest sensitivity gap balances balances balances balances repricing repricing repricing repricing total within within within after balance months months years years dollars in thousands interest earning assets fhlb interest bearing deposits   investment securities     mortgage backed securities
