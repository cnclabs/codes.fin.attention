item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview historically  our income consisted of agency revenues and telecommunications revenues 
agency revenues consist of commissions we formerly earned as an agent of bell atlantic and other regional bell operating companies  and long distance providers 
telecommunications revenues are generated by our sale of local  long distance  data communications  internet access and other communications services 
as a result of our transition to an integrated communications provider  or icp  in january  agency commissions earned after december  were not material 
our financial information for the nine months ended december  reflect our third year of operations under our new strategy 
our financial information for fiscal years ended on or before march  primarily reflects our operations as an agent for verizon formerly bell atlantic 
because of our transition to a new strategy and our network buildout  most of the financial information for these periods does not reflect our current business and is not comparable to results in subsequent periods 
results of operations nine months ended december  compared to unaudited nine months ended december  total revenues for the nine months ended december  transition were  an increase of from  restated for sab see note in consolidated financial statements for the comparable nine month period of transition 
as an integrated communications provider  revenues reflect our direct sales of local telecommunications services in addition to our direct sales of other telecommunications services  including toll and data services 
a common basis for measurement of an integrated communications provider s progress is the growth in access line equivalents  or ales 
ales are the total number of voice circuits and equivalent data circuits we have in service 
voice circuits are the actual number of voice circuits purchased by our customers 
we calculate our equivalent data circuits by dividing the data transmission capacity purchased by our customers by kilobits per second  which represents the capacity necessary to carry one voice circuit 
during the quarter ended december   voice and data ales in service increased by  or approximately from the quarter ended september  this brought our total ales in service to  at december  data ales increased by approximately from the quarter ended september  to  or of total ales in service as of december  data ales at december  include ales purchased by other carriers including internet service providers 
costs of telecommunications revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to  for transition from  restated for sab for transition as a result of our increase in direct sales of local telecommunications services and expenses associated with our powerpath sm network 
as a percentage of telecommunications revenue  costs of telecommunications revenues were and for transition and transition  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in transition from  restated for sab for transition this increase was primarily due to the costs incurred in opening additional branch sales offices and the associated increased number of sales  service and engineering employees hired in connection with the transition to the icp platform 
as of december   we had employees including sales executives and network coordinators in branch locations throughout the northeast and mid atlantic states as compared to employees including sales executives and network coordinators in branch locations at december  we incurred a charge of  for the consolidation of collocation and branch office sites to reduce costs and maximize network efficiency through optimal use of fiber deployment and to realize near term operating efficiencies through our branch sites 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in transition from  in transition this increase was a result of additional expense associated with the equipment and software relating to the network deployment and the upgrade of our information systems 
network equipment and software is being depreciated over years  reflecting the risk of rapid technological change 
interest and other expense increased to  for transition  as compared to interest and other expense of  for transition the increase in interest expense is due to increased borrowings to fund our operating losses and the deployment of our network 
there was an increase in interest income to  as a result of the proceeds of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in transition  as compared to interest income of  for transition the company incurred a charge of  for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle by adopting staff accounting bulletin no

costs of telecommunications revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal year as a result of our increase in direct sales of local telecommunications services 
as a percentage of telecommunications revenue  costs of telecommunications revenues were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the percentage of the cost of telecommunications revenues primarily reflects lower rates obtained from our major suppliers  verizon formerly bell atlantic and global crossing 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to  in fiscal from  for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the opening of additional branch sales offices and the associated increased number of sales and service employees hired in connection with the transition to the icp platform 
as of march   we had employees including account executives and network coordinators in branch locations throughout new england and new york 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was a result of additional expense associated with the equipment and software relating to the network deployment and the upgrade of our information systems 
interest and other expense increased to  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to interest and other expense of  for the fiscal year ended march  the increase is due to increased borrowings to fund our operating losses and the deployment of our network  the fees associated with our credit and vendor facilities  and the amortization of the interest expense associated with warrants issued in connection with the financings 
we incurred an extraordinary item of  relating to the early repayment of the senior secured goldman sachs fleet credit facility from fiscal year the cost reflects the unamortized balance of the warrants and closing costs of the credit facility which was repaid in march liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at march   an increase of million 
cash balances at december  and march  totaled  and  respectively 
the increase in working capital resulted from the net proceeds realized from a million preferred stock financing with bain capital inc million  thomas h 
lee partners  lp million and csfb private equity million 
the investment consists of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock which converts into our common stock at per share at any time at the option of the holder 
the company may require conversion of the preferred shares if the common stock of the company reaches certain levels 
the company may elect to redeem the preferred shares on the fifth anniversary of the closing and all outstanding shares of preferred stock must be redeemed or converted by may the net proceeds from the sale of the series b redeemable preferred stock are being used to fund strategic marketing and technology initiatives of our business plan which include the purchase of dark fiber and optronics  powerpath sm network expansion and new powerpath sm network product and applications development 
in march  td securities us inc underwrote a million senior secured credit facility td credit facility to fund our base plan for expansion of our branch sales offices and our powerpath sm network 
the proceeds were used to retire the million balance of the million goldman sachs fleet credit facility and to repay in full million of the cisco vendor financing facility 
the td credit facility includes a million senior secured year revolving credit facility  a million senior secured year delayed draw term loan and a million senior secured year term loan 
as of september   we entered into an amendment to the td credit facility to modify certain provisions of the agreement 
at december   we were not in compliance with a covenant related to the allowable level of other investments due to the balance of notes receivable from stockholders as disclosed in note subsequent to year end  the company received a waiver through march  for this non compliance and based on repayments which occurred on march   we are currently in compliance 
as of december   million of the td credit facility has been utilized with an additional million available immediately 
under the terms of the facility  million and the remaining million of term a must be borrowed by june  and september   respectively 
since september   we have entered into various lease and vendor financing agreements which provide for the acquisition of equipment and software 
as of december   the aggregate amount borrowed under these agreements was approximately million 
we will continue to use the balance of the proceeds realized from the td credit facility and series b redeemable convertible preferred stock financing for general corporate purposes including  capital expenditures  working capital and operating losses associated with the continued deployment of our network  further penetration of our existing region and our expansion into new markets throughout the northeast and mid atlantic states 
until utilized  the net proceeds from the td credit facility and series b redeemable convertible preferred stock financing are being invested in short term  interest bearing instruments and other investment grade securities 
we believe that proceeds available from the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock financing and the td credit facility  cash on hand and the amounts expected to be available under our bank and lease financing arrangements will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures  working capital and operating losses for at least the next months 
we also believe that the above noted sources fully fund our business plan as described in the business overview in item we cannot assure you that if we require funds in addition to the funds made available through the td credit facility and the preferred stock financing  such financing will be available  or if available  on terms acceptable to us when needed 
if we are unable to obtain such financing when needed  we may postpone or abandon our development and expansion plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the actual timing and amount of our capital requirements may be materially affected by various factors  including the timing and actual cost of the network  the timing and cost of our expansion into new markets  the extent of competition and pricing of telecommunications services by others in our markets  the demand by customers for our services  technological change and potential acquisitions 
description of senior secured facility td securities us inc facility in march  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with a consortium of banks 
the td credit facility is comprised of a million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolver with a seven and one half year term  a million senior  delayed draw term facility with a seven and one half year term term a and a million senior secured eight year term loan facility term b

as required by the td credit facility  term b borrowings of million were drawn down in full at the closing date along with borrowings of million under the revolver 
part of the proceeds were used to pay off the million cisco vendor financing facility and the outstanding balance of the goldman sachs fleet credit facility revolving line of credit of approximately million 
we paid a one time up front fee and other closing costs  which have been capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the td credit facility 
the unamortized balance of deferred financing costs associated with the goldman sachs fleet credit facility were recorded as an extraordinary item in the fiscal year ended march  the company will pay an annual commitment fee of

under the terms of the senior facility  million and the remaining million of term a must be borrowed on june  and september   respectively 
at june   the company will begin to repay the outstanding balances of term a and term b on a quarterly basis through the year in september  the company entered into an interest rate collar agreement with a notional amount outstanding at december  of million  with an expected maturity date in the year the interest rate collar effectively locks million of the senior facility borrowings between and

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended was issued  as amended by sfas nos 
and  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company is required to adopt the new standard effective january  because of the structure of the derivatives purchased by the company  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
the company is required to adopt the interpretation on july  the interpretation requires  among other things  that stock options that have been modified to reduce the exercise price be accounted for as variable 
the company modified one stock option agreement in april  which resulted in a stock compensation charge of approximately million 
no other option grants have been modified by a reduction of the exercise prices 
therefore  the adoption of the interpretation has  and will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  unless modifications are made in the future 
adoption of staff accounting bulletin the company has revised its revenue recognition policy for certain recurring monthly fees to be consistent with applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
previously  monthly recurring fees for the next month s service were recognized at the time all of the company s significant performance obligations had been fulfilled and the related monthly service fee became nonrefundable based on the terms of the company s contract with its customers which require days notice for cancellation 
since sab now indicates that nonrefundability of revenues and fulfillment of all significant performance obligations are not a basis for revenue recognition  the company has determined that deferral of the monthly recurring service fees to the period in which the service is available to the customer is a preferable method of accounting 
the impact of the change in recognizing recurring service fees was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of april  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the cumulative effect of this change increased the company s loss by approximately million as of april  this amount represents the income attributable to the deferral  as of that date  of one month s recurring service fee revenue totaling approximately million 
the previously reported quarterly financial information for the nine month transition period ended december  has been restated so that annual operating results for the transition period are presented on the new basis 
there is no impact to the company s cash flow from operations as a result of this change 
also  the adoption of this change in accounting for the fiscal year ended march  or prior periods did not have a material effect on the company s previously reported results of operations  financial position or cash flows for those periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to outstanding debt obligations 
we utilize our senior secured credit facility to fund a substantial portion of our capital requirements 
this facility bears interest at a variable interest rate  which is subject to market changes 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our borrowings under the td credit facility 
the td credit facility interest payments are determined by the outstanding indebtedness and the libor rate at the beginning of the period in which interest is computed 
as required under the td credit facility  we utilize interest rate swap and collar agreements to hedge variable rate interest risk on of the td credit facility 
all of our derivative financial instrument transactions are entered into for non trading purposes 
notional amounts outstanding at december  subject to the interest rate collar is million  with an expected maturity date in the year the interest rate collar effectively locks million of our td credit facility borrowings between and 
notional amount outstanding at december  subject to the interest rate swap is million  with an expected maturity date in the year the interest rate swap effectively caps million of our td credit facility borrowings at 
for purposes of specific risk analysis we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of our outstanding debt obligations 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on market sensitive instruments  considering the hedge agreements noted above 
we compare the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates 
we selected discount rates for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at december  we compared the market values resulting from these computations with the market values of these financial instruments at december  the differences in the comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
as a result of our analysis we determined at december   with respect to our variable rate debt obligations  a increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in increased interest expense and cash expenditures for interest of approximately 
million for the nine months ended december  a decrease in interest rates would result in reduced interest expense and cash expenditures of approximately million for the same period taking into consideration the interest rate collar as noted 
for purposes of specific risk analysis we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate redeemable convertible preferred stock 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in dividend rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compare the market values for dividend risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in the rates 
we selected discount rates for the present value computations based on market dividend rates in effect at december  we compared the market values resulting from these computations with the market values of these financial instruments at december  the differences in the comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
as a result of our analysis we determined at december   with respect to our fixed rate redeemable convertible preferred stock  a increase in dividend rates with all other variables held constant would result in increased dividends of approximately million for the nine months ended december  a decrease in dividend rates would result in reduced dividends of approximately million for the same period
