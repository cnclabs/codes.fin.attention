item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had approximately million of cash and investments on december  substantially all of the investments were us government or investment grade  fixed income securities from domestic issuers 
because of the credit risk criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of the company s investments  however  because management considers it unlikely that the company would need or choose to substantially liquidate the company s investments prior to their maturity  management believes that such an increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows 
even though the company distributes products abroad  the company does not conduct sales in foreign currencies 
therefore  management does not believe the company is exposed to any material foreign currency exchange rate risk
