factors that may affect future results of operations  financial condition or business statements made in this report  the annual report to shareholders in which this report is made a part  other reports and proxy statements filed with the securities and exchange commission  communications to stockholders  press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the company that are not historical in nature  or that state the company s or management s intentions  hopes  beliefs  expectations or predictions of the future  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  and involve risks and uncertainties 
the words could  should  will be  will lead  will assist  intended  continue  believe  may  expect  hope  anticipate  goal  forecast and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that any such performance  and actual results  financial condition or business could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results  financial condition or business over time 
quarterly operating results may vary the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including demand for the company s products and services  the company s long sales cycle  the long installation and implementation cycle for these larger  more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for the company s hna millennium products  a large percentage of the company s revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and costlier systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client 
the sale may be subject to delays due to clients internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources 
delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the company s anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings  since a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed 
these larger  more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented over time periods ranging from approximately six months to three years and involve significant efforts both by the company and the client 
in addition  implementation of the company s hna millennium products is a new and evolving process 
the company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the company s and the client s ability to meet these project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
in addition  support payments by clients for the company s products generally do not commence until the product is in use 
the company s revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year 
stock price may be volatile the trading price of the company s common stock may be volatile 
the market for the company s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  healthcare reform measures  client relationship developments and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the market for software  healthcare and high technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
market risk of investments the company accounts for its investments in equity securities which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method 
investments in other equity securities are reported at cost 
all equity securities are reviewed by the company for declines in fair value 
if such declines are considered to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in and the company acquired a interest  shares of common stock in careinsite  inc with a cost basis of   of these shares were received in as consideration for the sale of license software  and an additional  shares were purchased in the value assigned to the shares acquired in was  and was based on a methodology which utilized both a comparable company and the expected underlying discounted future cash flows 
the company was also granted  by careinsite   common stock warrants with an exercise price of per share thinc warrants 
the thinc warrants were exercisable only in the event that the health information network connections  llc thinc exercised warrants granted to them by careinsite at per share 
thinc was allowed to exercise their warrants days after the initial public offering of careinsite 
on january  careinsite completed an acquisition of thinc 
as part of that agreement   of the company s  thinc warrants became immediately exercisable  with the remaining amount forfeited 
on february   careinsite entered into an agreement to merge with healtheon webmd corporation merger agreement 
as part of the merger agreement  the company received shares of healtheon webmd corporation webmd in exchange for each common share of careinsite held by the company 
the warrants were also converted at the same exchange ratio 
the merger of careinsite and webmd merger closed on september  accordingly  the company recorded a non recurring investment gain of  net of tax  as a result of the exchange 
on december   the company sold  shares of webmd for  accordingly  the company recorded a non recurring investment loss of  net of tax  as a result of the sale 
at december   the company owned  shares of common stock of webmd  which have a cost basis of  and a carrying value of  as these shares are accounted for as available for sale 
the stock of webmd held by the company is registered but is subject to certain lock up provisions 
at december   the company also holds  warrants of webmd with an exercise price of and a cost basis and carrying value of  the warrants are carried at cost  as they do not have a fair value that is currently available on a securities exchange 
if the company realizes certain performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage  webmd will issue to the company  shares of common stock at a price of per share performance shares 
the performance shares were adjusted at a rate of shares of webmd for each share of careinsite 
the contracted measurement date was february  the company and webmd are in discussions regarding the attainment of the performance shares 
no amounts have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the performance shares pending completion of the discussions 
all physician users of systems of webmd corporation or its affiliates shall be included for purposes of determining the specified levels of physician usage 
the company s policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary 
if the market price of the webmd common shares does not recover to near the company s per share carrying value in the near term  the company will record a write down  through a charge to earnings  to establish a new cost basis in the security reflecting the then current market value 
at december   marketable securities which consist of money market and commercial paper of the company were recorded at cost  which approximates fair value of approximately million  with an overall average return of approximately and an overall weighted maturity of less than days 
the marketable securities held by the company are not subject to price risk as a result of the short term nature of the investments 
the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt since of its long term debt is at a fixed rate 
to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company conducts business in several foreign jurisdictions 
however  the business transacted is in the local functional currency and the company does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
all other business transactions are in us dollars 
to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the balanced budget act of public law contains significant changes to medicare and medicaid and began to have its initial impact in due to limitations on reimbursement  resulting cost containment initiatives  and effects on pricing and demand for capital intensive systems 
in addition  the issued and pending rules under the health information portability and accountability act of hipaa  will have a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information 
these factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in the company s products and services 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the company s products and services 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  the company s client base could be eroded  competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and product offerings  the stability of the information systems provider  the features and capabilities of the information systems  the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible products 
certain of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than the company and some of its competitors offer products that it does not offer 
the company s principal existing competitors include siemens medical solutions health services corporation  idx systems corporation  mckesson hboc  inc and eclipsys corporation  each of which offers a suite of products that compete with many of the company s products 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing products 
in addition  the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the company s success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced products that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance 
proprietary technology may be subjected to infringement claims or may be infringed upon the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  license agreements  confidentiality procedures  employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the trade secrecy of its proprietary information 
the company recently initiated a patent program but currently has a very limited patent portfolio 
as a result  the company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property 
in addition  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its products overlaps with competitive offerings 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive to defend 
if the company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights  it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property 
government regulation the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  the company is subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to its blood bank software 
if other of the company s products are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda  the company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including premarket notification clearance prior to marketing 
complying with these fda regulations would be time consuming and expensive 
it is possible that the fda may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in healthcare 
following an inspection by the fda in march of  the company received a form fda notice of inspectional observations alleging non compliance with certain aspects of fda s quality system regulation with respect to the company s pathnet hnac blood bank transfusion and donor products the blood bank products 
the company subsequently received a warning letter  dated april   as a result of the same inspection 
the company responded promptly to the fda and undertook a number of actions in response to the form and warning letter including an audit by a third party of the company s blood bank products and improvements to cerner s quality system 
a copy of the third party audit was submitted to the fda in october of and  at the request of the fda  additional information and clarification were submitted to the fda in january of there can be no assurance  however  that the company s actions taken in response to the form and warning letter will be deemed adequate by the fda or that additional actions on behalf of the company will not be required 
in addition  the company remains subject to periodic fda inspections and there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
any failure by the company to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products 
fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
product related liabilities many of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its products  such claims may be made in the future 
although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against the company which is uninsured or under insured could materially harm its business  results of operations or financial condition 
system errors and warranties the company s systems  particularly the hna millennium versions  are very complex 
as with complex systems offered by others  the company s systems may contain errors  especially when first introduced 
although the company conducts extensive testing  it has discovered software errors in its products after their introduction 
the company s systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients 
therefore  users of the company products have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally 
the company s agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters 
failure of a client s system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract  or could require the company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria 
the company s contracts with its clients generally limit the company s liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions 
anti takeover defenses the company s charter  bylaws  shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of delaware law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company 
such provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any such transaction 
these provisions include a a board of directors that is staggered into three classes to serve staggered three year terms  b blank check preferred stock  c supermajority voting provisions  d inability of shareholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting  e limitations on the ability of shareholders to nominate directors or make proposals at shareholder meetings and f triggering the exercisability of stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis  which may invoke extensive economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial ownership of the company s common stock exceeds a specified threshold 
certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the company not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders might receive a premium value for their shares
