see item risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on its investment portfolio which consists primarily of high quality short term money market funds  commercial paper and corporate bonds with an average maturity of less than one year 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in what it believes are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding average and individual duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   the company s total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments  the majority of which had average maturities within one year 
additionally  the company generally has the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
therefore  the company does not expect its results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s international sales and related royalties of dermabond r adhesive are based on sales in foreign currencies  but payable in us dollars  and thus may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
