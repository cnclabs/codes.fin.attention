forward looking statements include statements about the company s revenue  markets  margin  the effect of accounting changes  attempts to modify its banking facility  proprietary product sales including vivant sales  customers including internet related businesses  or irbs and focus on global companies  service and support costs  investment in research and development  foreign currency hedging activity  dependence on new products  management of growth  competition  international sales  dependence on suppliers and quarterly fluctuations 
the company s transition to sales of its proprietary products and its focus of sales efforts on global accounts may not be successful 
the company may experience a reduction in demand from irbs greater than that currently anticipated 
the company may fail to achieve anticipated revenue levels and efficiencies of operation 
given these uncertainties  investors in the company s common stock are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
see risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income loss other income  net equity in net loss of affiliate loss on foreign currency transactions income tax expense benefit net income loss net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was primarily because of decreased revenue of million and million from server products and software products  respectively 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal we transitioned our sales focus during fiscal towards our proprietary products  and away from our third party resale products 
as a result of this transition  we increased our sales efforts with irbs 
however  during fiscal  because of the lack of liquidity and resulting higher risk of success of the irbs  we experienced a decrease in demand for our proprietary products from irbs 
we elected to pursue sales from fortune and global customers 
these customers typically have a longer procurement cycle  which adversely affected net product revenue during fiscal year moreover  the secondary effect of the many irb collapses may affect our ability to grow revenues 
furthermore  a weakening economy could result in a decreasing demand for the information storage systems  software  and services 
we continue to refocus our sales efforts on the global brick and mortar companies  with which we have been successful historically 
see risk factors if there is a decrease in the demand for our products by internet related businesses  our business could materially suffer 
net product revenue for fiscal year increased million  or from fiscal year this increase was primarily because of increased revenue of million from server products  partially offset by decreased revenue from tape products and software products of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  our focus shifted away from resale of tape products to the sale of our own proprietary server products 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  up from nearly no revenue in fiscal year  when we introduced the vivant product family 
service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year increased revenue from maintenance contracts for increased field population was the main cause of this increase 
service revenue was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year this increase was primarily from increased revenue from maintenance contracts both domestically and in europe 
product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease resulted from a domestic increase in revenue concentration from back up products  which historically carry a significantly lower margin than our proprietary storage products 
this decrease was partly offset by a european increase in revenue concentration from proprietary products  primarily vivant 
also  lower operating volumes caused a significant decrease in our ability to absorb our manufacturing overhead  which reduced our product gross margin 
product gross profit for fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal year  and the product gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the product gross profit percentage was mainly from the increase in sales of server products  which historically carry a higher margin and the impact of the introduction of the vivant product line 
service gross profit service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year the decrease in service gross profit came mainly because our employment costs increased as we hired more people to staff anticipated service offerings 
we expected the number of installed vivant units to increase in fiscal year over fiscal levels 
during the first nine months of fiscal year  we hired more service and support staff 
we are upgrading the skills of our staff to support the increased volume of proprietary product and service offerings 
as a result  service cost of revenue increased in fiscal year we believe that this cost will not continue to increase in fiscal year because we now have sufficient field service staff 
service gross profit for fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to in fiscal year this increase in gross profit percentage primarily resulted from increased revenue from contracts without corresponding increases in support costs 
see risk factors we may be unable to hire  retain and integrate highly skilled personnel needed to sustain our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase was because of bad debt expense of million  primarily as a result of internet related customer non payments  and a million charge to write down goodwill related to the purchase of certain product lines from raxco  inc there were other expenses of 
million in legal and 
million in severance 
these increases were partly offset by lower salary  commission and bonus expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase and the increase as a percentage of total revenue were primarily because of increased compensation and related costs  exclusive of commissions  of million resulting from increased headcount  increased commissions of million  increased marketing efforts of million  million of severance related costs in fiscal year and increases in other expenses of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year this increase was primarily for increased development costs associated with hiring more staff to complete expansion of the vivant product line at the high end and also to expand our reach to the mid range 
we plan to continue our new product thrust in fiscal year research and development expenses in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase came from increased project costs of million  increased salary and related costs of million related to increased headcount  and increased other expenses of million 
restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we included a charge of million for severance in operating expenses 
of the charges  million was paid during fiscal year and million will be paid during fiscal year the restructuring included an aggregate net reduction of the workforce by employees or 
as a result of the restructuring  we expect to realize quarterly expense savings of million beginning in the second quarter of fiscal other income  net other income  net in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year this increase was primarily from increased interest income and decreased interest expense in fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this was a result of increased average cash balance during the year and eliminated credit line balances 
other income  net  in fiscal year increased million  or  over fiscal year other income  net  was approximately of total revenue in fiscal years and equity in net loss of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate represents our proportionate share of caldera systems  inc s caldera net losses and amortization of the goodwill related to the investment made in caldera in august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax benefit of million in fiscal year the increase was primarily because of the recording of a net million expense related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the net million tax expense was partly offset by million of tax benefit recorded in the first three quarters of fiscal year our management believes that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of the net deferred tax asset existing at april  based on projected financial results and available tax planning strategies  including the realizable value of our caldera investment 
we recorded a net tax benefit of million in fiscal year this is a one time benefit which is primarily a result of the reversal of valuation allowances held against certain net operating loss carryforwards 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was a result of management s determination that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets would be realized based on projected financial results and available tax planning strategies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at april  and april   respectively  which was an increase of million 
net operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  an increase of million as compared to fiscal year  primarily because increased collections decreased accounts receivable by million 
this source of cash was partially offset by the use of cash from a net loss adjusted for non cash items of million  an increase in inventories of million  which primarily resulted from a million increase in test equipment for engineering  and a combined decrease in prepaid and other assets  accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities of million 
net investing activities used cash of million to buy capital equipment 
the company expects to incur approximately million of capital expenditures in fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities was million primarily because of the exercise of stock options  and issuance of treasury shares  providing cash of million  offset by repayment of a note payable to caldera of million 
the company entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation as of july   and amended july   whereby the company may borrow up to million under an asset secured domestic line of credit  limited by the value of pledged collateral 
effective september   the company renewed its agreement with silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation 
the agreement allows the company to borrow at a rate equal to the prime rate plus 
borrowings under the line of credit are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including  without limitation  various financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a minimum quick ratio  debt net worth ratio  tangible net worth  and a maximum net loss  and restricts the company from paying any dividends 
the term of the agreement is for one year 
as of april   the company was in default under the amended loan agreement for failing to comply with certain covenants particularly the quick ratio and the maximum net loss covenants which were subsequently waived for the period ended april  pursuant to an agreement among the company  silicon valley bank and general electric capital corporation 
the quick ratio  the profitability  and the maximum net loss covenants of the loan agreement also were amended on may  the company is operating under the waiver and amended loan agreement 
there can be no assurance that the company will be in compliance with the new covenants in future periods 
the company s current line of credit agreement will expire september  the company has begun negotiations for a renewal of its existing credit facility and believes the company will be able to secure comparable financing prior to the expiration of the existing credit facility 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to the company 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at april  effective february   the company entered into an agreement the emc agreement by which we sold to emc substantially all of the company s existing patents  patent applications and related rights 
pursuant to the emc agreement  the company was entitled to receive million over the life of this agreement  in six equal annual installments of million each 
as of january  the company had received all installments 
the company also was to receive royalty payments in the aggregate of up to a maximum of million over the term of the emc agreement 
as part of the maximum million of royalties  minimum royalties of million were to be received in five annual installments  beginning within thirty days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the emc agreement  and within thirty days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
as of march  the company has received all installments 
also  pursuant to the terms of the emc agreement  million of the maximum million of royalties  will be received in five equal annual installments as a result of a computer and technology agreement between emc and ibm announced in march the first two annual installments were received in march and march management believes that the company s working capital and future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company may require additional funds to support its working capital requirements including financing of accounts receivable and inventory  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such funds through public or private equity financing  bank lines of credit or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be on terms favorable to the company 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fas fas 
fas amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
mti is required to adopt fas not later than the first quarter of fiscal year the company does not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact upon the company s financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk management practices 
however  the impact of adoption on the company s results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of the company s derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption and may result in more pronounced quarterly fluctuations in other income and expense 
in september  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was issued 
statement replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is effective for the company in the second quarter of fiscal year the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation and foreign currency exchange the company recorded million in foreign exchange loss during fiscal year  which came from european currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in order to minimize the foreign exchange loss  the company has used hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks  none of which were outstanding at april  there can be no assurance  however  that such actions successfully will reduce the company s exposure to financial market risks 
risk factors the non historical information in this form k constitute forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
the sections entitled risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business contain a discussion of some of the factors that could contribute to those differences 
factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
we are exposed to general economic conditions as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and of reduced capital spending  sales in the united states have declined as a percentage of our total revenue 
in particular  sales to irbs fell during fiscal year if the economic conditions in the united states worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  we may experience a materially adverse effect upon our business  our operating results  and our financial condition 
our business materially could be affected adversely as a result of a weakening demand in the technology market 
our profitability depends upon the demand for information storage hardware  software and services as a whole 
a decreasing demand for information storage systems  software  and services because of a weakening economy could result in decreased earnings 
if there is a decrease in the demand for our products by internet related businesses  our business could materially suffer 
in fiscal year we derived a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of our products to irbs 
any decrease in the growth of the internet  in the demand for our products by irbs or in the financial resources available to irbs to purchase our products  could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
during fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in demand for its products from irbs and made a decision to reduce its sales focus to irbs 
we may experience a reduction in demand from irbs greater than that currently anticipated 
we continue to refocus our sales force on penetrating global accounts more deeply 
however  these sales efforts may not be successful 
a significant portion of our sales occur in the last month of a given quarter and we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may not meet our expectations 
we have experienced historically a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly to increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter extremely difficult and uncertain 
if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be harmed materially for that quarter 
also  we operate without a significant backlog of orders 
as a result  our quarterly sales and operating results in any given quarter are dependent  in large part  upon the volume and timing of orders booked and products shipped during that quarter 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unanticipated decrease in our orders  sales or shipments 
therefore  any decline in the demand for our products and services  in relation to our forecast for any given quarter  could materially harm our results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of your investment in our common stock could be very volatile and it could decline because of variations between our actual and anticipated earnings  the timing and announcement of new products by us or by our competitors  services or technological innovations by us or by our competitors  failure of our results from operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or our competitive position  the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions broadly and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits  and reduced market share for our business 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
furthermore  our new products and technologies may depress the sales of existing products and technologies 
we must manage product transitions successfully so that the introductions of the new products do not adversely affect our sales of existing products 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include ability to introduce new technology  product quality  reliability and performance  quality of service and support  and responsiveness to customer and market needs 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including emc  hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  compaq and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological and personnel resources than we do 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be either indicative of future results or helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we anticipate that these fluctuations may continue into the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including changes in demand for our vivant line of products and services  the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the timing of customer orders  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of our products  shifts in our product mix  the timing of sales  marketing  research and development expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  any of which could cause a significant adverse change in the trading price of our common stock 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
we believe that the development and introduction of new  innovative products with features that respond to our customers changing demands and incorporate new technological standards will be critical to our future success 
we may not be able to design and manufacture products that address customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure by us to design  manufacture and successfully introduce new products could harm our business materially 
our ability to successfully introduce new products depends on several factors  including timely completion of product design  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance 
we face additional risks inherent in new product introductions  including competitors responses to our product introductions  pricing pressures from competitors products  difficulties in forecasting customer demand  the desire of customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time  and unanticipated development problems or delays 
these risks may result in unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention or the abandonment of the development of a specific product 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies  which could harm our business materially 
our systems are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly  and time consuming to repair 
undetected software or hardware errors frequently occur in networking products when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
our systems are complex  and from time to time we may find errors in our existing  new  or enhanced products 
also  our systems are combined with products and components made by other vendors  and if errors occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these errors  whether caused by our or another vendor s products  could adversely affect sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
we are dependent upon limited source suppliers for principal components used in our products  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in component costs could harm our business materially 
for our vivant product line  we currently purchase disk drives solely from seagate technology  inc  chipsets solely from qlogic corporation  and raid controllers for the vivant s series solely from mylex corporation 
disruptions in supply or significant increases in the component costs from these vendors could materially harm our business and our results of operations 
we order components and materials based upon rolling forecasts which could cause us to overestimate or underestimate our actual requirements 
this could cause us to increase our costs  needlessly or prevent us from meeting customer demand 
we use rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend upon factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
as a result  our component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to our customers 
any of these occurrences would affect unfavorably our business and results of operations 
we depend upon our key personnel 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of the services of our executive officers could harm materially our business 
the failure to retain key members of our senior management team  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our senior management team  could harm materially our business 
in addition  a number of the members of our senior management team joined us recently  as we replaced certain management personnel 
thus  our management team has had limited time to work together and as a result  may have difficulty working together to successfully manage our business 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales 
international sales represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
for example  international sales represented of our total sales for fiscal year if we are unable to maintain international market demand for our products  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  export restrictions  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
all of our sales in international markets are priced in the applicable local currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we currently enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure  which can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results from operations could suffer 
in the future  we may expand our international presence in other markets which may require significant financial and managerial resources 
also  expansion into new international markets may involve additional risks  including uncertainty of market acceptance of our products because of language  cultural or other barriers  and differences in technologies and computing infrastructures needed to use our products and services 
if our international expansion efforts do not yield anticipated levels of sales  our business and results from operations could be harmed materially 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions  provisions for staggered terms of office of the board of directors  and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
also  the rights of holders of our common stock may be affected adversely by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our intellectual property is critical to our business and  if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  the success of our business and our results from operations could be harmed materially 
our intellectual property includes patents  proprietary technology  trade secrets  copyrights  and trademarks 
we rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights  and we may be unable to detect this unauthorized usage or to enforce our rights effectively 
any legal action that we may bring to protect our intellectual property rights could be expensive and distract our management from day to day operations 
further  the laws of some countries in which we sell our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in the united states 
unauthorized usage or misappropriation of our intellectual property could harm our business materially 
we may face costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
in addition  in the future  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses  or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we could have to redesign our products  which could be costly and time consuming and could substantially delay product shipments  assuming that a redesign is feasible 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  likely would be time consuming  costly  and a distraction to our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
if we are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may be unable either to sell our systems or to be competitive in the marketplace 
our systems must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the united states and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we introduce in the future also must meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our systems integrate san and nas technologies into a single storage architecture 
components of the san and nas must comply with evolving industry standards 
we also depend upon companies that provide other components of the san and nas to meet these standards 
if our vendors or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a single stockholder  and other stockholders may not be able to influence corporate decisions 
raymond j 
noorda  our chairman of the board  is also the chairman of the board of our largest stockholder  the canopy group  inc canopy 
ralph j 
yarro iii  our director  is also the director and president and chief executive officer of canopy 
canopy beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock and is able substantially to affect our actions which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without mr 
noorda s or mr 
yarro s support 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
the company has used and may continue to use hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks  none of which were outstanding at april  there can be no assurance that such actions will reduce successfully the company s exposure to financial market risks 
the company maintains a million credit line 
the interest rate applied to any debt outstanding under this credit line is equal to the prime rate plus and is  therefore subject to a certain amount of risk arising from fluctuations in these rates 
however  we believe that a increase in interest rates would not have a material impact upon the company s results of operations
