item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of rainmaker systems  inc rainmaker should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and rainmaker s financial statements and the related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results including those set forth in risk factors and elsewhere in this prospectus 
overview rainmaker systems  inc rainmaker is a leading outsource provider of internet enabled sales and marketing services 
rainmaker delivers targeted programs to maximize revenue per customer and strengthen customer loyalty 
our contract renewals plus sm and education sales plus sm services optimize the sales and management of support contracts  software subscriptions and training offerings 
by integrating technology  processes and people  rainmaker provides a transparent customer relationship infrastructure for its clients 
rainmaker was founded in as unidirect corporation  a catalog distributor of business software 
we distributed unix  nt and web server software products manufactured primarily by the santa cruz operation  inc sco  microsoft corporation  corel corporation  v systems inc 
and sunsoft  inc our customers consisted of end users  resellers and distributors 
in january  we entered the customer relationship management crm services business and signed our first crm services contract 
in  we decided to focus exclusively on crm services and added three new crm services clients that year 
in may  we sold certain assets related to our catalog distributor businesses for approximately million in total consideration 
the assets sold included approximately  of inventory  approximately  of computer software as well as intangible assets including the domain names and logos 
the buyer also assumed approximately  of accounts payable related to these businesses  which is included as part of total consideration 
we received million in cash on the closing date and a note for million  of which  was paid in may the remaining  balance was paid in may in  we recorded a gain related to the sale of these businesses of approximately million 
this gain consisted of the million of consideration less assets sold of approximately million  compensation and severance amounts paid to former employees of these businesses of approximately   of catalog distributor businesses assets disposed of because they were no longer used by us and  of direct transaction costs including banking  legal and accounting fees 
in and  we recorded additional gains of approximately  and  respectively  based on receipt of remaining sales proceeds paid to us 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
sab was required to be adopted by rainmaker in the fourth quarter of with retroactive adoption as of january  we believe our revenue recognition policies conform to the requirements of sab and  therefore  our adoption did not have a material impact on our revenue or results of operations in concurrent with the adoption of sab  rainmaker also adopted the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
eitf interprets sab and addresses when a company should report revenue as the gross amount billed to a customer versus the net amount earned by the company in the transaction 
specific indicators should be used by companies to determine if it is more appropriate for them to record revenues on a gross versus a net basis 
these indicators include  but are not limited to  whether the vendor is the primary obligor in the transaction  whether the vendor assumes general inventory risk  and whether the vendor has latitude for setting the pricing for the goods or services its sells to its customers 
absence of these indicators might indicate that revenue should be recorded on a net basis 
substantially all of our sales transactions are reported under the gross method based on amounts billed to our customers as we take title and assume risk of loss for products sold and assume the full credit risk and establish pricing for the products and services we sell 
however  we also sell products and services on behalf of customers of our clients whereby  based on the evaluation of the same indicators  we record revenue net equal to the amount earned in the transaction 
our current revenue reporting practices are consistent with the revenue reporting criteria established in eitf the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our reported revenues 
our crm services revenue consists of sales of our clients software subscriptions  support and service contracts  training services  licenses and upgrades to our clients installed customer base 
substantially all of our sales transactions are reported under the gross method  which is based on the total purchase price billed by us to customers for our clients products and services 
revenue from the sale of service contracts and maintenance renewals is recognized when a purchase order from the end user is received  the service contract or maintenance agreement is delivered  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain 
revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment of the product directly to the customer 
revenue from services we perform is recognized as the services are delivered 
revenue from sales of new clients products and services typically increases over several quarters before reaching a more moderate level of growth 
however  revenue growth can be affected by many factors including customer contract renewal history  customer product satisfaction and competitive pricing 
cost of revenue includes payments for our clients products and services based on the specific pricing terms of each contract and costs associated with fee based revenues 
costs associated with fee based revenues consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses 
the costs of these products and services can be higher during the start up phase of our relationship with a client until higher purchase discounts are achieved from increased sales volume 
as a result  the gross margins earned on sales during the start up phase can be lower  which can reduce our overall margins 
this impact on overall margins may be significant depending on the number of new clients in any period 
once we integrate a client s customer database and begin to meet targeted sales volumes  our gross margins from that client can improve 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with the marketing and selling of our clients products and services  including client integration costs  salaries of marketing and sales personnel  technology systems and communications costs  product and service development and administrative overhead 
interest income expense  net  reflects income received on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on leases to secure equipment and software 
although our operating income and net income have grown in each year from to  we incurred an operating loss and net loss for and during and  we incurred increasing operating and net losses as we increased our operating expenses to build our crm services business 
new clients require significant up front investments including the costs to hire additional staff and create the necessary infrastructure to deliver our services 
these costs are typically incurred some time before significant revenue is generated 
in late  we repackaged our service offering to include fee based pricing 
we now charge for many of these costs  however  these costs could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and operating results  depending on market acceptance of new service combinations and pricing options 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods given  selected financial data as a percentage of our revenue

revenue from crm services decreased to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to a decline in business from our largest client and to clients who we discontinued provided services to in in late  we decided to focus our resources on clients with which we can maintain profitable business relationships 
since january   six new clients were signed which accounted for million of revenue during this compares to seven new clients which were signed in and accounted for million of revenue during that year 
during  revenue from crm services sold to customers of existing clients clients for which we generated revenue during decreased a net amount of million 
revenue from our largest client decreased million from to one client signed in the fourth quarter of generated  in revenue during and million during and is not included in the million of revenue noted above for clients signed since january  crm services gross profit 
gross profit from crm services decreased to million for  from million for gross margin from crm services decreased to in compared to during the decrease in gross margin is due primarily to a change in service and product mix and a change in the mix of new and existing clients with lower margins on sales of services 
gross margin in the third and fourth quarters of was and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
excluding restructuring charges  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses increased to for from in the percentage increase was primarily attributable to the strategic decision to increase personnel additional average number of personnel during as compared to  and to increase levels of investment in systems  infrastructure and product development  all of which are designated to support recent and anticipated new client growth and new service offerings and deliver a more robust infrastructure to support that growth 
restructuring 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million or per share  in connection with a restructuring program  approved by the board of directors during the quarter  designed to accelerate a return to profitability 
the program resulted in a reduction of positions at all levels in rainmaker 
million of the charge was related to cash severance payments 
the restructuring was complete as of december  the remaining million of the charge was not used and was reversed in the fourth quarter of below is a table summarizing activity related to the restructuring charge in s severance legal and benefits and other total q provision cash payments reverse unused accruals balance at december  interest income and expense 
we recorded million of net interest income in  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher average invested cash balances  resulting from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in november  which resulted in rainmaker receiving million of net proceeds 
income tax expense benefit 
we did not record any income tax expense or benefit for compared to a million income tax benefit for the expected benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to the operating loss for was not recorded because we established a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
the expected benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to the operating loss for differs from the benefit recorded because we established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that exceed income taxes recoverable from prior years 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue from crm services increased to million for from million for during  revenue from crm services provided to existing clients clients for which we generated revenue over the entire year accounted for million of the increase over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the inclusion of new services and product lines and growth of the installed customer base partially offset by a million decline in revenue from ftp software  inc ftp  which was acquired by netmanage  inc in august during  we added seven new clients which accounted for million of our revenue during that year 
during  there was no revenue from the catalog distributor businesses  which were sold in may in  these businesses generated revenues of million 
gross profit 
gross profit from crm services increased to million for from million for in line with revenue growth

selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for these expenses for included approximately five months of operations associated with the catalog distributor businesses  which were sold in may as a percentage of total revenue  these expenses increased to for the most recent year from in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the strategic decision to increase levels of investment in personnel  systems and infrastructure and product development to support recent and anticipated new client growth 
specifically  we hired additional personnel within sales  marketing and product development in depreciation expense increased by million in compared to  due primarily to accelerated depreciation on information systems to be substantially replaced 
in addition  during  we wrote off approximately  of older non year compliant computers and telephone systems  which were replaced with new equipment 
we recorded deferred compensation of million in this represents the difference between the exercise price of options granted to acquire our common stock and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant date 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of approximately  during deferred compensation expense at december  is being amortized using the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the options 
interest income expense  net 
we recorded  of net interest income in  as compared to  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher invested cash balances resulting from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of million in november and sale of preferred stock of million in february partially offset by million used to repurchase stock during the year 
income tax expense benefit 
we recorded a million income tax benefit for compared to million of income tax expense for the expected benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to the operating loss for differs from the benefit recorded because we established a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that exceed income taxes recoverable from prior years

a higher proportion of computers  software  and contract services tend to be sold in the fourth calendar quarter 
as a result  we have experienced seasonal declines in revenues between the fourth and first calendar quarters 
our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
in the second quarter of  we began a review of our existing client base  as well as our client targeting process and methodology 
as a result  in the last half of  we have discontinued services to certain clients which have resulted in a lower base of revenues 
see risk factors our future operating results may not follow past trends or meet market expectations 
liquidity and sources of capital historically  we have funded operations from operating cash flows and net cash proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  and in november  the initial public offering of our common stock 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  working capital at december  was million 
cash used in operating activities during was million compared to million for the change of million year over year was due primarily to the increase in net loss of million 
the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the strategic decision to increase personnel additional average number of personnel during as compared to  and to increase levels of investment in systems  infrastructure and product development  all of which are designated to support recent and anticipated new client growth and new service offerings and deliver a more robust infrastructure to support that growth 
in addition  we reduced the payable to a related party of  in these were partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes and other operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts payable  trade accounts receivable  and income taxes receivable  net 
excluding restructuring related transactions  cash used by operations was approximately million 
cash used in operating activities during was million compared to million provided by operations for the prior year 
the change of million was due primarily to the absolute change in net income loss of million as we earned million during but lost million during this increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the strategic decision to increase levels of investment in personnel  systems and infrastructure and product development to support recent and anticipated new client growth 
in addition  we increased our inventories by  in due to the addition of new clients 
this increase in inventories compares to a decrease of  for  primarily due to the sale of the catalog distributor businesses 
the decrease in deferred taxes accounted for million of the change in the year 
changes in other operating assets and liabilities  primarily trade accounts receivable  accounted for the balance of the decrease in cash used by operating activities 
cash used by operating activities for included cash used by the catalog distributor businesses 
cash used in investing activities during was million compared to million for the increase was primarily due to capital expenditures  totaling million partially offset by the sale of million of short term investments in the capital expenditures consisted primarily of computers and software related to our new erp system and other technology initiatives 
in  we had million of capital expenditures and million of purchases of short term investments partially offset by million of sales of short term investments and  of proceeds received from the sale of our catalog distributor businesses 
cash used in investing activities during was million compared to million provided by investing activities for the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to amounts received from the sale of our catalog distributor businesses in may and the purchase of short term investments in the total sales price of our catalog distributor businesses was paid in three installments 
we received the first installment of million from the sale in may  the second installment of  in may  and the final  installment in may capital expenditures totaled million for compared to  for capital expenditures consisted primarily of additional computers and software in both periods 
in addition  we spent  in to replace our older non year compliant computers and telephone systems 
cash used in financing activities during was million compared to cash provided of million for in  we repurchased and retired million of common stock and repaid million of capital lease obligations 
this was offset by million of proceeds received from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities during was million compared to a use of  for the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the sale of common stock in our initial public offering of million and sale of preferred stock of million in february  partially offset by million used to repurchase shares of our stock during the year 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents at december  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
potential impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends fas to be effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we will adopt fas in the first quarter of because we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued financial standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
fin addresses the application of apb no 
to clarify  among other issues  a the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on rainmaker s financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we have incurred recent losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we entered into the crm services business in january we incurred an operating and net loss of million for and an operating loss of million and a net loss of million for we expect to incur operating and net losses for at least the next twelve months as we continue to build our business 
because we depend on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue  the loss of a single client could result in a substantial decrease in our revenue 
we have generated a significant portion of our revenue from the sales of products and services of a limited numbers of clients 
as of december   we have clients 
in  sales to customers of sybase  inc sybase  sco  parametric technology corporation  and novell  inc novell accounted for approximately    and  respectively of our crm services revenue 
in  sales to customers of sco and sybase accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our crm services revenue 
in  sales to customers of sco  ftp and novell accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our crm services revenue 
we expect that a small number of clients will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
the loss of any of our principal clients could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
in addition  our software and other technology clients operate in industries that are consolidating  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
for example  ftp was acquired by netmanage  inc in august since that acquisition  our revenue from sales to customers of ftp has declined significantly and declined to zero in the third quarter of in late  we decided to focus our resources on clients with which we can maintain a profitable business relationship 
this resulted in discontinuation of relationships to certain clients and a lower base of revenues 
there is a possibility that we may discontinue more client relationships which could cause a decrease in our revenue 
our revenue will decline if demand for our clients products and services decreases 
our business primarily consists of selling and marketing our clients products and services to their existing customers 
in addition  most of our revenue is based on a pay for performance model in which our compensation is based on the amount of our clients products and services that we sell 
accordingly  if a particular client s products and services fail to appeal to its customers for reasons beyond our control  such as preference for a competing product or service  our revenue from the sale of client s products and services may decline 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  and  if we do not meet market expectations  our stock price could decline 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of future performance 
although our operating results have generally improved from quarter to quarter until recently  our future operating results may not follow past trends in every quarter  even if they continue to improve overall 
in any future quarter  our operating results may be below the expectation of public market analysts and investors 
factors which may cause our future operating results to be below expectations include 
the growth of the market for outsourced crm solutions  
the demand for and acceptance of our services  
the demand for our clients products and services  
the length of the sales and integration cycle for our new clients  
our ability to develop and implement additional services  products and technologies  and 
the expansion of our direct sales force and its rate of success 
the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles for our services could cause delays in our revenue growth 
selection of our services often entails an extended decision making process on the part of prospective clients 
we often must provide a significant level of education regarding the use and benefit of our services  which may delay the evaluation and acceptance process 
the selling cycle can extend to approximately six to nine months or longer between initial client contact and signing of a contract for our services 
additionally  once our services are selected  the integration of our services often can be a lengthy process which further impacts the timing of revenue 
because we are unable to control many of the factors that will influence our clients buying decisions or the integration of our services  the length and unpredictability of the sales and integration cycles will make it difficult for us to forecast the growth and timing of our revenue 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and sales and technical personnel  the quality of our services may decline  and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales and technical personnel and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified sales  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for personnel is intense as these personnel are limited in supply 
we have at times experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in the future 
any difficulties could limit our future growth 
the loss of certain key personnel  particularly michael silton  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could seriously harm our business 
we have obtained life insurance policies in the amount of million on michael silton 
during  we have had some turnover within our executive management team 
as a result  our current management team has worked together for only a relatively short time 
our ability to execute our strategies will depend upon our ability to integrate these and future managers into our operations 
we have strong competitors and may not be able to compete effectively against them 
competition in crm services is intense  and we expect such competition to increase in the future 
our competitors include comprehensive system integrators  e commerce solutions providers  and other outsource providers of different components of customer interaction management 
we also face competition from internal marketing departments of current and potential clients 
many of our existing or potential competitors have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  which could further impact our ability to address competitive pressures 
should competitive factors require us to increase spending for  and investment in  client acquisition and retention or for the development of new services  our expenses could increase disproportionately to our revenues 
competitive pressures may also necessitate price reductions and other actions that would likely affect our business adversely 
additionally  there can be no assurances that we will have the resources to maintain a higher level of spending to address changes in the competitive landscape 
failure to maintain or to produce revenue proportionate to any increase in expenses would have a negative impact on our financial results 
the growth in demand for outsourced sales and marketing services is highly uncertain 
demand and acceptance of our sales and marketing services is dependent upon companies being willing to outsource these processes 
it is possible that these solutions may never achieve broad market acceptance 
if the market for our services does not grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to successfully manage additional growth 
our recent growth has placed significant demands on our management  administrative  operational and financial resources 
in addition  our anticipated future growth will place additional demands on our resources 
we will need to continue to improve our operational  financial and managerial controls and information systems and procedures and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our overall work force 
if we are unable to manage additional growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
our business strategy may ultimately include expansion into foreign markets which would require increased expenditures  and if our international operations are not successfully implemented  they may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business 
our long term growth strategy includes expansion into international markets 
as a result  we may need to establish international operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional clients and customers in those markets 
this expansion may require significant financial resources and management attention and could have a negative effect on our earnings 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in creating international demand for our crm services or that we will be able to effectively sell our clients products and services in international markets 
the development of international operations may also involve the following risks 
the appeal of our marketing programs  including the use of e mail and direct marketing techniques  to international customers  
the increased cost associated with designing and operating web sites in foreign languages  
differing technology standards and internet regulations in other countries that may affect access to and operation of our web sites  and 
difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable for the products and services that we sell 
we cannot assure you that these factors will not have an adverse effect on future international sales and earnings 
any acquisitions we may make could result in dilution  unfavorable accounting charges and difficulties in successfully managing our business 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
future acquisitions by us could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could cause our financial performance to suffer 
furthermore  acquisitions entail numerous risks and uncertainties  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could limit our future growth 
although we do not currently have any agreement with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
however  we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities 
we rely heavily on our communications infrastructure  and the failure to invest in or the loss of these systems could disrupt the operation and growth of our business and result in the loss of customers or clients 
our success is dependent in large part on our continued investment in sophisticated computer  internet and telecommunications systems 
we have invested significantly in technology and anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to do so in the future to remain competitive 
these technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles  which require us to anticipate technological developments 
we may be unsuccessful in anticipating  managing  adopting and integrating technological changes on a timely basis  or we may not have the capital resources available to invest in new technologies 
temporary or permanent loss of these systems could limit our ability to conduct our business and result in lost revenue 
if we are unable to safeguard our networks and clients data  our clients may not use our services and our business may be harmed 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hacking  computer viruses and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
although we intend to continue to implement industry standard security measures  these measures may be inadequate 
damage to our single facility and the california energy crisis may disable our operations 
our operations are housed in a single facility in scotts valley  california 
we have taken precautions to protect ourselves from events that could interrupt our services  such as off site storage of computer backup data and a backup power source  but there can be no assurance that an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster affecting our facility would not disable these operations 
any significant damage to this facility from an earthquake or other disaster could prevent us from operating our business 
california s two largest power companies are currently experiencing a power shortage that has resulted in rolling blackouts to maintain the stability of the state power grid 
our facilities are susceptible to power interruptions as long as the energy crisis continues 
one of the power companies  pg e  has filed an additional contingency plan with the california public utilities commission that would  if implemented  result in lengthy and routine power interruptions that would directly impact our leading edge process technology development efforts  which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we are continuing to assess the impact of the energy crisis on our operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property or face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party  we may lose our intellectual property rights and be liable for significant damages 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property 
in addition  we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
if third parties infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade names or other proprietary information  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us that we violated their intellectual property rights 
these claims  even if not true  could result in significant legal and other costs and may be a distraction to management 
in addition  protection of intellectual property in many foreign countries is weaker and less reliable than in the united states  so if our business expands into foreign countries  risks associated with protecting our intellectual property will increase 
we have applied for registration of the service mark rainmaker systems  contracts renewals plus  and education sales plus in the united states  and certain foreign countries 
increased government regulation of the internet could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and online services may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere covering issues such as online privacy  copyright and trademark  sales taxes and fair business practices or which require qualification to do business as a foreign corporation in certain jurisdictions 
increased government regulation  or the application of existing laws to online activities  could inhibit internet growth 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business and otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to government regulation of direct marketing  which could restrict the operation and growth of our business 
the federal trade commission s ftc s telemarketing sales rules prohibit misrepresentations of the cost  terms  restrictions  performance or duration of products or services offered by telephone solicitation and specifically addresses other perceived telemarketing abuses in the offering of prizes 
additionally  the ftc s rules limit the hours during which telemarketers may call consumers 
the federal telephone consumer protection act of contains other restrictions on facsimile transmissions and on telemarketers  including a prohibition on the use of automated telephone dialing equipment to call certain telephone numbers 
a number of states also regulate telemarketing and some states have enacted restrictions similar to these federal laws 
in addition  a number of states regulate e mail and facsimile transmissions 
the failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could result in penalties 
there can be no assurance that additional federal or state legislation  or changes in regulatory implementation  would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
our directors and their affiliates own a large percentage of our stock and can significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and entities affiliated with them together control approximately of our outstanding shares based on the number of shares outstanding as of february  
as a result  any significant combination of those stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of all directors  and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of rainmaker  which  in turn  could depress the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents and delaware law contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts  even if a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders 
the provisions of delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors the authority  without stockholder action  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board determines when we will issue preferred stock  and the rights  preferences and privileges of any preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term
