local currencies will remain legal tender until december  by no later than december   participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills for use in cash transactions 
by no later than july   participating countries will begin using the euro as the legal tender and will withdraw all legacy currencies 
the euro conversion may lead to increased competition between countries and potential erosion of margins as prices in different countries are more transparent 
the company is reviewing its marketing strategies to address possible increased competition 
the company will continue to review the impact of the conversion to the euro  however  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
market risks the company is exposed to various market risks  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures primarily relate to the sale of products to foreign customers  purchases from foreign suppliers  acquisition of raw materials from both domestic and foreign suppliers  and changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures when it is considered practical to do so in accordance with established policies and procedures 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
as a global company  changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar affect the company s financial results 
the company  from time to time  enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge booked receivables and payables  as well as forecasted transactions  denominated in foreign currencies that  when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact the income statement 
for certain markets  particularly latin america  where foreign exchange contracts are not available or determined not to be cost effective  the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through pricing and working capital management 
the company may also use from time to time  a strategy of using either foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge foreign currency effects on operating results 
there can be no assurances that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of local currencies 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
although the company attempts to utilize transaction hedging to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which the company sells products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which the company incurs costs  the company s sales or costs may be adversely impacted 
as of december   the company had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
a hypothetical adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million  however  less than million of this change would impact earnings since the gain loss on the majority of these contracts would be offset by an equal gain loss on the underlying exposures being hedged 
forward looking statements the company and its representatives may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements with respect to future goals of the company  including statements contained in this report  the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s reports to shareholders 
the words or phrases will likely result  are expected to  will continue  is anticipated  estimate  project  believe or similar expressions identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and those presently anticipated or projected 
the company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which are current only as of the date made 
among the factors that could cause the company s actual results in the future to differ materially from any forward looking opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods are the following competitive industry conditions the company operates in highly competitive environments 
the company s competitors are both larger and smaller than the company in terms of resources and market shares 
the marketplaces in which the company operates are generally characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  a variety of distribution channels  relatively large and aggressive marketing efforts  evolving customer needs away from product purchases and towards increasing integrated business solutions  and declining prices in certain product lines 
driving demand in the data storage industry is an expanding need to access  manage and store information more rapidly and at lower cost  with greater accuracy and reliability 
similarly  the demand for image management and color management products  services and work flow solutions continues to grow as the use of images and color continues to expand in both commercial and consumer applications 
these offerings are characterized by increasing use of digital technologies  including software and services  replacing analog based products where the company currently has a strong market position in several areas 
in particular  the data storage industry is undergoing rapid technology and market changes  and the varieties of data storage media formats available for customers is increasing 
the data storage market is characterized by short product development cycles that are driven by rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences as well as declining product prices 
success in introducing and gaining acceptance of new data storage media is dependent on the ability to develop relationships with distributors and original equipment manufacturers oem s 
in these highly competitive markets  the company s success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products  services and customer solutions cost effectively and on a timely basis 
the success of the company s offerings is dependent on several factors including competitive technology capabilities  differentiation from competitive offerings  effectiveness of marketing programs and low costs 
although the company believes that it can take the necessary steps to meet the competitive challenges of these marketplaces  no assurance can be given with regard to the company s ability to take these steps  the actions of competitors  some of which will have greater resources than the company  or the pace of technological changes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to introduce new products or maintain competitive technology competencies  that the markets will be receptive to its new products  that the company s marketing programs will be successful  or that the company s competitors will not introduce more advanced products ahead of the company 
in addition  while the company currently has access to significant proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties  there can be no assurance that it will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products 
in addition  new technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability 
therefore  the company must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the technologies in which the company desires to invest 
if the company is not successful in executing any of the above described risks  the company may incur a material adverse impact on its business and financial results 
availability of raw materials  energy and purchased products the company makes significant purchases of raw materials  energy  and certain purchased products from many domestic and foreign sources for use in its manufacturing operations and for resale to customers 
while the company is presently able to obtain sufficient raw materials  energy and purchased products to meet its needs  no assurances can be given that such availability at acceptable pricing levels will continue 
if the company is unable to continue to obtain critical raw materials  energy and purchased products  the company may incur a material adverse impact on its business and financial results 
international operations and foreign currency the company does business in more than countries outside the united states 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of the company s revenues in  may be subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations  including political instability  the possibility of expropriation  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  local government involvement required for operational changes within the company  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
in addition  the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign currency hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks over near term periods  however  these risk management activities can not assure that these programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
intellectual property rights the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and protect its intellectual property rights and to defend itself against intellectual property infringement claims of others 
if the company is not successful in defending itself against claims that may arise from time to time alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  the company could incur substantial costs in implementing remediation actions  such as redesigning its products or processes or acquiring license rights 
such costs or the disruption to the company s operations occasioned by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company utilizes valuable non patented technical know how and trade secrets in its product development and manufacturing operations 
although the company utilizes confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect such proprietary information  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached or that competitors of the company will not acquire the information as a result of such breaches or through independent development 
the company has pursued a policy of enforcing its intellectual property rights against others who may infringe those rights 
in connection with such enforcement actions  the company may incur significant costs for which the company may or may not be reimbursed by the alleged infringer 
sale of medical imaging business as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on november   the company sold substantially all of its worldwide medical imaging systems business to kodak 
excluded from this sale was the ferrania facility  at which certain x ray and wet laser medical imaging products and photographic film are manufactured 
as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on august   the company closed on the sale of its worldwide photo color systems business  including the ferrania facility  to ferrania lux 
the kodak asset purchase agreement obligates kodak to pay to the company up to million under certain conditions upon the sale of the ferrania facility 
kodak has challenged the company s claim for the full million as well as claims for other amounts which the company believes are due from kodak in connection with the sale of the medical imaging systems business 
while the company believes that the applicable contractual terms support its position  it cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of these disputed items 
restructuring programs while the company s restructuring plans are designed to reduce the company s cost structure and improve its profitability  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving its financial improvement goals in the future and in implementing its restructuring program on a timely basis to achieve the projected benefits 
in addition  if it becomes necessary for the company to shut down or restructure additional businesses and operations in the future  it could incur substantial additional charges in the process 
the recording of these charges could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
fluctuations in the company s stock price the company s stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
if revenue or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate impact on the company s stock price 
the stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
future capital requirements on december   the company entered into a three year million loan agreement with a group of banks 
the loan agreement provides for revolving credit  including letters of credit  with borrowing availability based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and manufacturing machinery and equipment not to exceed million 
borrowing availability as of december  was million 
the company expects that cash and equivalents  together with cash flow from operations and availability of borrowing under its current and future sources of financing  will provide liquidity sufficient to operate the company 
retention of key talent and employees the company operates in a highly competitive market for key talent and employees 
while the company is presently able to retain key talent and employees  no assurances can be given that this situation will continue 
if the company is unable to retain its key talent and employees  the company may incur a material adverse impact on its business and financial results 
strategic alternatives the company has retained goldman sachs to assist in a review and exploration of various strategic alternatives including  but not limited to  financial restructuring  stock repurchases  spin offs  joint ventures  and business combinations
