the senior subordinated note repayment and million of the other long term debt repayment resulted from the use of the proceeds of the initial public offering  which occurred in march the remaining million for the early paydown of the other long term debt came from operating cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources boyds primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under its credit agreement  which includes a revolving credit facility 
boyds primary uses of cash are to fund working capital and to service debt 
cash flow from operations decreased million  or  to million in from million in the cash flow decrease was primarily attributable to the decreases in net income  accrued expense and accrued taxes  partially offset by a decrease in inventory net 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the funds  realized primarily from net income  were used to repay outstanding debt 
in connection with the recapitalization discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  boyds issued senior subordinated notes due in an amount of million and entered into a credit agreement providing for a million senior secured term loan and a senior secured revolving credit facility providing for borrowings up to million 
on april   boyds repaid million of the notes  and has subsequently repaid a further million  leaving a balance outstanding of million 
boyds has repaid million of the term loans under the credit agreement through december   leaving a balance outstanding of million 
the revolving credit facility provides loans in an aggregate amount of up to million 
boyds had borrowed million under the revolving credit facility at december  thus  the unused balance available under the revolving credit facility will be available to fund the working capital requirements of boyds 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum  equal to a margin over either a base rate or libor  at boyds option 
the revolving credit facility commitment will terminate on april  effective april   the tranche a term loan is amortizing over six years and the tranche b term loan is amortizing over seven years 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and events of default  including substantial restrictions on boyds ability to declare dividends or make distributions 
the term loans are subject to mandatory prepayment with the proceeds of certain asset sales and a portion of boyds excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   the tranche b term loan had been fully repaid 
boyds does not expect to incur significant capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  due to its sourcing arrangements with suppliers 
management believes that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility will provide adequate funds for boyds foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service obligations  the common stock repurchase program and the bond repurchase program 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital and there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to boyds on acceptable terms or at all 
boyds ability to fund its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  to refinance indebtedness and to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements  depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond boyds control 
on may   boyds board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares of boyds common stock 
as of december   boyds had repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to this stock repurchase program for an aggregate amount of approximately million  thus completing the program 
these repurchases were financed out of operating cash flow and approximately million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility which were subsequently repaid 
on february   boyds announced that its board of directors had approved the repurchase of an additional million shares of boyds common stock 
as of december   boyds had repurchased  shares of common stock pursuant to this stock repurchase program for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
these repurchases were financed out of operating cash flow 
any future repurchases under this program are expected to be financed similarly or by utilizing borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
boyds plans to make such purchases from time to time in the open market or in private transactions 
on july  boyds announced that its board of directors had approved a repurchase program for its outstanding series b senior subordinated notes due as of december   boyds had repurchased million of its notes pursuant to this note repurchase program 
these repurchases were financed out of operating cash flow 
any future repurchases under this program are expected to be financed similarly or by utilizing borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
boyds plans to make such purchases from time to time in the open market or in private transactions 
seasonality boyds does not have the significant seasonal variation in its orders that it believes is experienced by many other giftware and collectibles companies 
boyds receives orders throughout the year and generally ships merchandise out on a first in  first out basis 
approximately of orders are taken between november and april while approximately of orders are placed between may and october in anticipation of the holiday season 
boyds does not build a large receivables balance relative to sales because it typically does not offer its customers long payment terms or dating programs 
foreign exchange the dollar value of boyds assets abroad is not significant 
boyds sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  are not subject to changes in exchange rates 
boyds imports most of its products from manufacturers in china 
boyds costs could be adversely affected on a short term basis if the chinese renminbi appreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
conversely  its costs would be favorably affected on a short term basis if the chinese renminbi depreciates significantly relative to the united states dollar 
although boyds generally pays for its products in united states dollars  the cost of such products fluctuates with the value of the chinese renminbi 
in the future  boyds may  from time to time  enter into foreign exchange contracts or prepay inventory purchases as a partial hedge against currency fluctuations 
differences between the amounts of such contracts and costs of specific material purchases are included in inventory and cost of sales 
boyds intends to manage foreign exchange risks to the extent appropriate 
recently issued accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
boyds will adopt sfas effective january  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of boyds

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of million at december  of this amount million  under the credit agreement  is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
a hypothetical change in interest rates applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of the company 
the company faces currency risk exposure that arises from translating the results of its united kingdom operations to the us dollar 
the currency risk exposure is not material as the united kingdom subsidiary operations do not have a material impact on the company s earnings
