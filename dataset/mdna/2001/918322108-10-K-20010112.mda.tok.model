future accounting changes in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin the staff accounting bulletin summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
any changes that may be required as a result of this bulletin are required to be implemented no later than the last fiscal quarter of the fiscal year beginning october  management is finalizing its assessment of the impact this bulletin will have  if any  on the company s financial statements 
operating results marketing services segment year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  last year 
this increase was due to various projects  including those projects mentioned in item the largest new projects this year were vehicle launch activities  test drive programs  and dealership training 
during the year  a continuing contract with annual revenue of approximately million was lost 
we do not expect the see the entire impact of this in the next year  as it is being phased out 
management will seek to replace the business or make cost cutting measures as necessary 
cost of revenue as a percentage of sales increased approximately four percentage points from last year 
the large value of the jobs mentioned in the revenue paragraph above had a higher cost of revenue proportion than our other revenues 
income from operations from the marketing services segment increased from  to  in the current year 
the rate of increase in operating expenses was less than the rate of increase in revenues because we were able to better utilize our core skilled staff 
thus  we were able to experience significant revenue growth without having to increase our staff as much as we would have needed to otherwise 
the increase in operating expenses is primarily personnel expense increases 
year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment decreased to  for the year ended september  from  in the previous year 
this decrease was due to approximately  in various projects which were completed and not replaced with similar work during the fiscal year  and another  was lost due to project scope reduction and schedule slippage 
cost of revenue as a percentage of sales decreased approximately four percentage points from the previous year 
the jobs mentioned in the revenue paragraph above had a higher cost of revenue proportion than our other revenues  and accounted for the decrease 
income from operations from the marketing services segment decreased from  to  our operating expenses decreased slightly in the rate of decrease in operating expenses was less than the rate of decrease in revenues 
while there was a decrease in operating expenses  this decrease was not sufficient to offset the unexpected decline in revenues 
although sales decreased and personnel reductions were made  management chose to maintain a core skilled staff as we anticipated future sales growth opportunities 
another factor which negatively impacted operating expenses was depreciation expense which rose  primarily due to a full year s depreciation of a call center building and related equipment  purchased in fiscal year  and its contents 
 of goodwill in psg was written off because it was considered to be impaired see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  in this increase was due in large part to the pilot phase of a ride and drive program for an automotive manufacturer 
vsi drew from the full range of its in house capabilities to create  produce and field the program within a day timeframe 
vsi also completed the launch of a new truck product for an automotive manufacturer and was immediately awarded the assignment to launch two new model year trucks 
income from operations from the marketing services segment increased for fiscal  to  up from  the year before 
the increase is attributable to an increase in sales and the efficient utilization of overhead 
entertainment edutainment sector year ended september  revenues from the entertainment edutainment segment decreased to  for the year from  last year 
during the year we were told by our potential customers that their plans were on hold 
our grossology touring exhibits and the drunk driving simulator  as mentioned in item  were our primary revenue for the year 
the drunk driving simulator program completed in december  unless and until another sponsor can be arranged  revenues for this segment will be approximately million lower than it otherwise would be 
income from operations from the entertainment edutainment segment decreased to a loss of  from an operating income of  for the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to the lack of revenue mentioned above 
although revenues decreased  operating expenses rose as we shifted production efforts to the construction of three grossology touring exhibits 
upon completion of these exhibits  layoffs and other cost cutting measures have been implemented 
the market for our products appears to remain soft 
while we do not expect to have this kind of loss next year  it is uncertain whether or not this sector will be profitable 
it is difficult to anticipate sales and income trends 
year ended september  revenues from the entertainment edutainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to new animation work received from universal studios florida men in black exhibit and for the et adventure attraction coming to universal studios japan 
income from operations from the entertainment edutainment segment increased to  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to efficiencies achieved from utilization of existing tooling and technologies on repetitive projects 
it is difficult to anticipate trends 
year ended september  revenues from the entertainment edutainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to new animation work received from universal studios hollywood for t d battle across time attraction and for the et adventure attraction coming to universal studios japan 
income from operations from the entertainment edutainment segment increased to  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to efficiencies achieved from utilization of existing tooling and technologies on repetitive projects 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
our two market segments have contrasting operating capital needs 
the marketing services segment requires considerable operating capital to support its accounts receivable and maintain its marketing infrastructure  while billing is periodic with little risk of non payment  client payment is typically slow 
it also experiences a relatively steady cash flow  there is a historically increased need for working capital in the late summer and early autumn as new vehicle communications services are provided 
this results in greater bank borrowings during that time of year  the lines of credit are designed to meet any such need we may have 
this year  our increased sales led to significant increases in our accounts receivable  accounts payable and notes payable balances at year end 
certain amounts received from clients in advance had been restricted and held in escrow until costs related to a specific job are incurred by the company 
during the year ended september   the escrow arrangement was terminated  resulting in reduced balances for cash in escrow and advances from clients 
the entertainment edutainment segment requires relatively little capital for operating purposes  because its clients typically pay sizable deposits before projects begin  and make progress payments during project fabrication 
sales represent discretionary spending on the part of its customers and their customers 
because of this  projects are sometimes delayed  conversely several different projects can be awarded in a short period of time 
the revenue and earnings of the entertainment edutainment segment are highly variable  and will probably continue to be so 
generally  all obligations are met out of cash flow generated from operations and borrowings 
based on current business conditions  we expect to meet our current obligations with cash flow generated from operations and borrowings 
investing activities 
capital expenditures for were approximately million higher than this is primarily attributed to the construction of three grossology touring exhibits in our entertainment edutainment segment  and to investment in interactive voice response and other systems for our call center in our marketing services segment 
venture investments include navidec  oz entertainment company oec  and ecollege 
com 
navidec nvdc nasdaq is a developer of web sites and information services 
oz entertainment company is developing a theme park  both physically and virtually  based on the wizard of oz movie and additional books in the oz series  the park is scheduled for completion in ecollege

we view these strategic investments in equity positions as opportunities to leverage our core competencies to expand our business lines and enter new markets 
bank covenants prohibit us from making significant additional investments in these companies 
navidec is a developer of web sites and web based complete automotive purchase transaction and information services for prospective customers 
their product  referred to as driveoff 
com  was sold during the year to carpoint  which is majority owned by microsoft 
at january   the  shares  acquired for  had a fair market value of during the year  we invested an additional  in oz entertainment company oec  bringing our total investment to million  of which million is invested in kc investors  lp as a limited partner 
this partnership was formed as an investment partnership to fund the continuing development of oec  a corporation in which the partnership holds a majority interest 
oec will develop the wonderful world of oz theme park 
we recognized losses of  and  for the years ended september   and  respectively  related to this investment 
we expect to see continued losses until the opening of the park  currently scheduled for the park is planned to be constructed on  acres of land owned by the federal government 
it is necessary to receive title to the land before construction can begin 
in order to receive title to the land  approval must be received from two governmental authorities 
the first authority tabled consideration of this until february  it is anticipated that title will be received during the next year 
the success of the park as an investment is dependent upon receiving title to the land  as well as certain infrastructure improvements being completed by or paid by governmental agencies  financing arranged through governmental agencies  as well as additional public or private financing 
if the park does not open  the entire investment  currently valued at  is at risk 
the projections provided and prepared by the management of kc investors  lp and oec forecast that the park will be profitable upon opening 
see item for a discussion of related party investments in kc investors  lp and in oec 
during fiscal year  we invested million in convertible preferred stock in a private placement offering of ecollege

see the discussion in item regarding related party notes receivable and payable and advances  and declared distributions to stockholders 
financing activities 
at september   we had lines of credit totaling  interest on these lines were at london inter bank offered rate libor plus  at september  the interest rate was and the outstanding balances were  these lines of credit mature in march  and march  these lines of credit have covenants restricting us from borrowing elsewhere  loaning or guaranteeing a loan of another company without the prior written consent of the bank  transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business  and declaring dividends 
other covenants mandate certain levels of net worth and working capital  and that the ratio of total liabilities to net worth  debt service ratio and current ratio do not exceed certain amounts 
we have had a long term relationship with the bank 
through the years  it has provided financing and lines of credit for us 
there can  however  be no assurances that the lines of credit will be renewed when they mature 
if we are unable to renew these lines of credit  other sources of financing would be sought  primarily a line of credit from another banking institution 
since we are a net borrower of funds  minimal cash balances are kept on hand 
at any point in time  we may have more money in checks outstanding than the cash balance 
when checks are presented for payment  the bank notifies us  and we borrow on our lines of credit to cover the checks 
during the year  we borrowed million from related parties at a interest rate  due on demand 
at september   the balance was at september   our long term debt consists of mortgages totaling  and a term note relating to building improvements of  the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to and at prime at september  
the mortgages include a balloon payment for any unpaid balances at the end of the term of the notes 
the balloon payments are due beginning june  through october  no other long term debt financing for facilities is expected in fiscal year we anticipate selling one of the warehouses we own in livonia  michigan  the sale price is expected to exceed the net book value  and would generate cash in excess of the mortgage balance 
on a long term basis  increased financing may be necessary to fund any large project awarded to us  or any acquisitions we may make 
while there are no current plans to conduct an offering of stock  in the long term  that cannot be ruled out 
during fiscal year  we acquired  of treasury stock 
capital activities 
employees exercised stock options for   and  shares in fiscal year  and respectively 
we granted stock options at a weighted average price of  and for   and  in fiscal year  and respectively 
the options are exercisable two and three years from the date of grant in two equal parts  and expire five years after the date of grant 
in december  we implemented a restricted stock plan for  shares 
during  the number of shares authorized for the plan was increased to  awards of   shares and  shares were granted under the restricted stock plan during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the shares vest one  two and three years from the date of grant in three equal parts  in december  and  we issued   and  shares respectively 
we do not expect the exercise of stock options  or purchase of shares  by employees and directors to be a material source of capital in fiscal year we believe that cash flows from operations along with borrowings will be sufficient to finance our activities in we have no current plans to conduct an offering of our shares to the public in fiscal year outlook although the past few months have been challenging ones for the stock market  the u 
s economy s continued control of inflationary factors and modest interest rates  added to low unemployment  argues for a relatively stable automotive market 
truck sales continue to fuel the auto industry s growth  with most automotive industry analysts predicting sales of approximately  to  new vehicles automobiles and trucks in the united states in while this is lower than sales in  the market has been relatively consistent over the past few years 
approximately of our revenues are directly associated with the automotive industry 
we cannot determine what impact a reduction in automobile sales may have on us 
in the marketing services segment  we continue to align ourselves with people  products and processes that recognize and take advantage of how the world goes about conducting business and accessing information 
our ties to the auto industry includes customer contact activities 
the emphasis on globalization  combined with budgets needed to reach a worldwide audience  is placing new emphasis on training opportunities on the world wide web 
our substantial investments in this area make us poised to take advantage of the opportunities as they arise 
customer relationship management initiatives are placing increasingly critical importance on e business within the auto industry as clients look for answers and assistance from turnkey solution providers such as us 
we help clients identify their customer base  create and execute strategic tactical marketing  distribute and fulfill and ultimately evaluate results to justify the expenditure 
as manufacturers continue to outsource  we have an opportunity for growth by providing additional services to these manufacturers  advertisers  and other marketers 
we believe that experiential events are becoming increasingly popular among clients as they continue to realize the impressive long term results from this area of customer relationship building 
we deliver all inclusive experiential events that encompass the wide array of products and services that we can offer our clients  from internet online registration to product procurement and exit interview research studies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our revolving credit agreements  which bear interest at a floating rate 
we do not use derivative or other financial instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk or for trading purposes 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of basis points in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates average basis points more in the next months  the adverse impact on our results of operations would be approximately  net of income tax benefit 
we do not anticipate any material near term future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates related to our long term debt obligations as almost all of our long term debt obligations have fixed rates 
foreign currency risk 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  principally canada and australia  foreign currency translation gains and losses are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies in the internet information technology and entertainment areas for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in long term assets  and are accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on these investments when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are permanently impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
we are also exposed to equity price risk on our investments in publicly traded companies 
our available for sale securities at september  include our equity positions in navidec  inc and ecollege 
com  which have experienced significant volatility in their stock prices 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity price would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value in our available for sale securities  based upon january  closing market prices for navidec and ecollege 
com
