item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
inhale s actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this annual report under the heading risk factors 
overview since our inception in july  we have been engaged in the development of a drug delivery system to deliver a wide range of drugs  including peptides  proteins  nucleic acids and other molecules  by inhalation to the deep lung and as part of our long term goal to be the pre eminent provider of the drug delivery solutions 
we have been unprofitable since inception and expect to incur significant and increasing additional operating losses over the next several years primarily due to increasing research and development expenditures and expansion of late stage clinical and early stage commercial manufacturing facilities 
to date  we have not sold any commercial products and do not anticipate receiving revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   we incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
our sources of working capital have been equity and debt financings  revenues from development contracts and short term research and feasibility agreements  financings of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements and interest earned on investments of cash 
we have generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements generally pay for some or all research and development expenses and make additional payments to us as we achieve certain key milestones 
we expect to receive royalties from our partners based on their revenues received from product sales  and to receive revenue from the manufacturing of powders and the supply of devices 
in certain cases  we may enter into collaborative agreements under which our partners would manufacture or package powders or supply inhalation devices  thereby potentially limiting one or more sources of revenue for us 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products utilizing our pulmonary drug delivery system 
there can be no assurance that we can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
in january we issued  shares of our common stock to the holders of all of the existing issued ordinary share capital of bradford particle design  plc  a united kingdom company 
we issued these shares as partial consideration for the acquisition of the outstanding share capital of bradford particle design plc in a private placement exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended and or regulation d or regulation s promulgated under the act 
for each share of bradford particle design plc s common stock we issued new shares of our common stock and paid approximately cash  for an aggregate cash payment of approximately million 
in october we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock 
the october notes were sold only in the united states to certain qualified institutional buyers under an exemption from registration provided by rule a of the act 
the october notes will mature in and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
in february we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which are convertible at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock 
the february notes were sold only in the united states to certain qualified institutional buyers under an exemption from registration provided by rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the february notes mature in and are convertible at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
in october and november we entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of these outstanding february notes to convert their notes into shares of our common stock in exchange for a cash payment made by us 
to date  we have made cash payments of approximately million in the aggregate in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million principal amount of outstanding february notes into approximately million shares of our common stock 
in february  we entered into privately negotiated agreements with certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures sold in october and november  providing for the conversion of approximately million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debentures into approximately million shares of common stock for net payments of approximately million 
results of operations years ended december   and contract research revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in from levels and in from levels 
costs of contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expense 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to december   and the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to december  were both primarily due to expansion of our existing collaborative agreement with pfizer  and include activities associated with the manufacture of phase iii clinical supplies 
pfizer represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  revenue for and included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and progress payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenues cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining new collaborative agreements  timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due to increased spending related to the scale up of technologies for current partnered projects  the continuing development of our global manufacturing operations in order to support phase iii inhaleable insulin clinical trials and commercial production  increased investment in internally funded research and development projects for next generation products and non cash compensation associated with stock options 
the increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to increased headcount  supplies and services to support our on going research and development efforts 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next few years as we expand our development efforts under collaborative agreements and start up our commercial operations 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was due primarily to a non cash compensation charge associated with stock options and the costs associated with supporting our increased manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing and business development activities 
the decrease in expenses in from is attributed to an increased percentage of general and administrative related costs allocated to research and development operations 
general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase over the next few years as we expand our operations 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest income in from and the million increase in interest income in from were primarily due to our maintaining larger cash and investment balances  including the proceeds of our issuance of several offerings of convertible subordinated debentures and higher interest rates 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in interest expense in from primarily relates to interest paid on the various convertible subordinated notes and debentures issued 
the million increase in interest expense in from related to the convertible subordinated debentures issued in october at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided for by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
acquired in process research and development on november   we concluded an agreement with alliance pharmaceutical corp 
to acquire alliance s pulmosphere tm particle and particle processing technology for use in respiratory drug delivery 
under the terms of the agreement  we received the rights to pulmosphere tm technology  other related assets including research materials  laboratory records  and certain equipment that had been used in the development of pulmosphere tm technology and the manufacturing and testing of particles using such pulmosphere tm technology  and alliance stock valued at million in exchange for million in cash and million of our stock 
additionally  we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs  which are included in the total purchase consideration 
alliance also has the right to additional substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on a defined number of products commercialized using the technology 
of the total purchase consideration  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d and was charged as an expense in the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development costs ipr d 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase and a portion of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which under current accounting rules is immediately expensed 
at the date of the acquisition  the in process technology had no alternative future use and did not qualify for capitalization 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our debt and equity securities  revenues from development contracts and short term research and feasibility agreements  financing of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  and interest income earned on it s investments of cash 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
our operations used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts differed from our net operating losses in these periods principally due to increased debt conversion incentives  non cash compensation charges associated with stock options and depreciation expense 
additionally  we recorded a million and million write off of ipr d charges for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october  we entered into a financing arrangement with a special purpose entity to complete construction of existing office facilities and provide financing for future capital improvements of up to million 
as a result of our continuing involvement and significant influence in the special purpose entity  and other provisions in the leasing transactions  the facility costs and capital lease obligations of the special purpose entity are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we purchased net property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in is primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment  our investment in our commercial manufacturing facilities  including device manufacturing at third party contract manufacturers  and expansion of our san carlos powder processing facilities 
the company also invested million in the purchase of pulmosphere tm technology in  in addition to our non cash exchange of common stock for shares of alliance valued at million 
in october  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures 
in february and october  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
this includes net payments of approximately million and million in connection with agreements that provide for the conversion of approximately million and million of our october and february debentures  respectively  that were outstanding at december  we expect our cash requirements to continue at an accelerated rate due to expected increases in costs associated with further research and development of our technologies  development of drug formulations  process development for the manufacture and filling of powders and devices  marketing and general and administrative costs 
these expenses include  but are not limited to  increases in personnel and personnel related costs  purchases of capital equipment  investments in technologies  inhalation device prototype construction and facilities expansion  including the completion of our manufacturing facility and start up of commercial operations 
given our current cash requirements  we believe that we will have sufficient cash to meet our operating expense requirements for at least the next months 
however  we plan to continue to invest heavily in our growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development arrangements  potential acquisitions of technologies  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scale up of our powder processing and packaging technologies  the timing and cost of our late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to satisfy our long term needs  we intend to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  increases in interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures  which pay a fixed rate of interest
