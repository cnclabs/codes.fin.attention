funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate supplemental financial measure of an equity reit s operating performance since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as reductions of income from operations 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company considers recoveries of investments in properties subject to finance leases to be analogous to amortization for purposes of calculating ffo 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance  or for cash flows as a measure of liquidity or its dividend paying capacity 
furthermore  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
effective january   nareit clarified the definition of ffo to include non recurring items except for those that are treated as extraordinary under gaap 
the table below provides a reconciliation of net income in accordance with gaap to ffo as calculated under the current nareit guidelines for the years ended october   and amounts in thousands 
certain amounts have been restated to conform to the current guidelines net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders    plus real property depreciation  amortization of tenant improvement and lease acquisition costs and recoveries of investments in properties subject to finance leases    adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture less gains on sales of real estate investments   funds from operations    results of operations fiscal vs
