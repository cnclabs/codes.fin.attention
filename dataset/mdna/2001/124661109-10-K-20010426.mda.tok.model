item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations raw material pricing and productivity  and inflation 
o our ability to meet customer demand depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages in the future 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
o our growth objectives are largely dependent on our ability to renew our pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  successfully complete research and development projects  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  or gain market acceptance of the new products 
our growth objectives are also largely dependent upon our ability to successfully expand our production capacity 
o as part of our strategy for growth  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions  and in the future  may make divestitures and form strategic alliances 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to us 
o our facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations 
the costs of complying with complex environmental laws and regulations  as well as internal voluntary programs  are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate since the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the problem  the complexity of the site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties prps at multiparty sites  and the number and financial viability of other prps 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental regulations 
o our results of operations could be affected by significant pending and future litigation adverse to c d  such as  without limitation  product liability  contract and employment related claims 
see item legal proceedings 
o our performance depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the level of competition among employers for skilled personnel is high 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the foregoing list of important factors is not all inclusive  or necessarily in order of importance 
reportable segments our operations are classified into the following reportable business segments o powercom division o dynasty division o power electronics division o motive power division segments are determined using the management approach  which means the way management organizes the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance

most of our independent manufacturer s representatives operate under contracts providing for compensation on a commission basis or as a distributor with product purchases for independent resale 
dynasty and power electronics products are sold via a network of independent manufacturer s representatives as well as independent distributors located throughout the united states and canada 
in addition to these networks of independent manufacturer s representatives and distributors  we employ internal sales management consisting of regional sales managers and product market specialists 
the regional sales managers are each responsible for managing a number of independent manufacturer s representatives and for developing long term relationships with large end users  oems and national accounts 
we also employ a separate sales force that works with the independent manufacturer s representative network and certain large customers 
we have internal divisional marketing departments in each of our divisions 
these departments manage the development of new products from the initial concept definition and management approval stage through the engineering  production and sales processes 
these departments are also responsible for applications engineering and technical training of sales representatives 
we maintain branch sales and service facilities in the united states  canada  europe and asia  with the support of our headquarters and service personnel  and have business relationships with sales representatives and distributors throughout the world 
no single customer of c d amounted to percent or more of our net sales for the year ended january  we typically sell our products with terms requiring payment in full within to days 
we warrant our products to perform as rated for specified periods of time  ranging from one to years  depending on the type of product and its application  in an amount that decreases over the life of the product 
the longest warranties generally are applicable to flooded standby power batteries sold by our powercom division 
backlog the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing and product mix of orders and  taking into account considerations of manufacturing capacity and flexibility  the speed with which we fill those orders 
period to period comparisons may not be meaningful 
certain orders may be canceled by the customer prior to shipment 
our order backlog at march  was  and at march  was  we expect to fill virtually all of the march  backlog during fiscal manufacturing and raw materials we manufacture our products at eight domestic plants  two plants in china  two in the united kingdom and one each in mexico and ireland 
we manufacture most key product lines at a single focused plant in order to optimize manufacturing efficiency  asset management and quality control 
expansion and consolidation 
we are continuing the process of capacity expansion at several of our plants 
in fiscal we closed our costa mesa  california and agua prieta  mexico facilities 
production previously performed at these facilities was primarily transferred to our nogales  mexico facility 
no facilities were closed during fiscal the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products include lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components  all of which are generally available from multiple suppliers 
other than the required use of one supplier of lead and one supplier of lead oxide for the production of round cell batteries for tyco  we use a number of suppliers to satisfy our raw materials needs 
iso recognition 
during fiscal we continued our program of iso recognition and received iso certification at our huguenot  new york facility 
iso certification assures customers that our internal processes and systems meet internationally recognized standards 
we are iso certified at the following other domestic locations blue bell  pennsylvania headquarters  conshohocken  pennsylvania r d battery laboratories  conyers  georgia  dunlap  tennessee  leola  pennsylvania  milwaukee  wisconsin and tucson  arizona 
internationally  we are iso certified at our operations in nogales  mexico  shanghai  china and shannon  ireland 
all of ncl s operations are either iso or certified 
competition our products compete on the basis of o product quality and reliability  o reputation  o customer service  o delivery capability  and o technology 
we also offer competitive pricing  and we value our relationships with our customers 
in addition  we believe that we have certain competitive advantages in specific product lines 
we believe that we are one of the four largest producers of reserve power systems in north america 
in motive power  we believe that one competitor  enersys inc formerly yuasa  inc  has a significantly larger market share than we have 
our company  along with two other manufacturers  occupies a second tier of the motive power market in which we have a larger market share than our smaller competitors 
for both reserve and motive power systems  we believe that the ability to provide a single source for design  engineering  manufacturing and service is an important element in our competitive position 
in reserve power systems  we believe we are the only major north american company that manufactures complete  integrated reserve power systems consisting of both electronics and batteries 
our other major competitors manufacture either electronics or batteries  but not both 
in motive power  all our major competitors supply integrated power systems  but only our company and one competitor manufacture both electronics and batteries 
with respect to power supplies  we believe that we are among a small group of large competitors in this fragmented industry 
when lead prices rise  certain of our competitors that own smelting operations may have lower lead costs than we have 
however  when lead prices decline  the high fixed costs associated with these operations may provide us with a cost advantage 
research and development we maintain extensive technology departments concentrating on electrochemical and electronics technologies 
we focus on o the design and development of new products  o the ongoing development and improvement of existing products  o sustaining engineering  o production engineering including quality testing and managing the expansion of production capacity  and o the evaluation of competitive products 
our research and development facilities in the united states and europe feature advanced computer aided design and testing equipment 
technology and engineering personnel coordinate all activities closely with operations  sales and marketing in order to better meet the needs of customers 
we continue to develop new products in our businesses 
during fiscal  our powercom division introduced the lct and the fam batteries 
the lct is a flooded battery designed with improved post seals and high rate performance and is sold exclusively to tyco 
the fam is a valve regulated battery designed with front access to the battery terminals  resulting in easier installation and maintenance 
also during fiscal  the powercom division successfully marketed a new variation of its acm modular power plant  the acmi  which consists of a space saving design resulting in a percent smaller footprint than the original acm international operations in addition to our domestic manufacturing facilities  we have international manufacturing facilities in mexico  ireland  china and the united kingdom 
products produced by our domestic  mexican and irish facilities are shipped primarily to the united states  and  to a lesser extent  to canada and europe 
our joint venture facility in shanghai  china manufactures industrial batteries that are sold primarily in china and europe 
our power electronics division facilities in the united kingdom and guangzhou  china manufacture electronics that are sold primarily in europe  north america  and to a lesser extent  the far east 
international sales accounted for  and of net sales for the years ended january   and  respectively 
additional financial information regarding our international sales is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see part ii  item patents and trademarks our policy is to apply for patents on new inventions and designs and actively pursue pending and future patent applications 
we believe that the growth of our business will depend primarily upon the quality of our products and our relationships with our customers  rather than the extent of our patent protection 
while we believe that patents are important to our business operations  the loss of any single or several patents would not have a material adverse effect on our company 
we regard our trademarks c d r  c d technologies r  c d technologies power solutions r  c d powercom r  dynasty r  liberty r  liberty series r  maximizer r and orion r as being of substantial value in the marketing of our products and have registered these trademarks in the united states patent and trademark office 
our trademarks also include c line tm  compucharge r  ferro five r  ranger r  rangernet r  scout r and v line r 
employees on march  we had approximately  employees 
of these employees  approximately  were employed in manufacturing and almost were employed in field sales  technology  manufacturing support  sales support  marketing and administrative activities 
our management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory 
employees in four domestic plants are represented by four different unions under collective bargaining agreements 
environmental regulation our operations are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations regarding the clean up and protection of the environment  worker health and safety and the protection of third parties 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  the following o requirements relating to the handling  storage  use and disposal of lead and other hazardous materials used in manufacturing processes and solid wastes  o record keeping and periodic reporting to governmental entities regarding the use of hazardous substances and disposal of hazardous wastes  o monitoring and permitting of air and water emissions  and o monitoring and protecting workers from unpermitted exposure to hazardous substances  including lead used in our manufacturing processes 
we operate under a comprehensive environmental  health and safety compliance program  which is headed by an environmental vice president and staffed with trained environmental professionals 
as part of our program  we o prepare written environmental and health and safety practice manuals  o conduct employee training  o undertake periodic internal and external audits of our operations and environmental and health and safety programs  o practice and engage in routine sampling and monitoring of employee chemical and physical exposure levels  and o engage in sampling and monitoring of potential points of environmental emissions 
in addition  we also have installed certain pollution abatement equipment to reduce emissions of regulated pollutants into the environment 
our program monitors and seeks to resolve potential environmental liabilities that result from or may arise from current and historic hazardous materials handling and waste disposal practices 
we have instituted a spent product recapture and recycling program for our facilities and our customers 
while we believe that we are in material compliance with the applicable environmental requirements  we have received  and in the future may receive  citations and notices from governmental regulatory authorities that certain of our operations are not in compliance with our permits or applicable environmental requirements 
occasionally we are required to pay a penalty or fine  to install control technology or to make equipment or process changes or a combination thereof as a result of the non compliance or changing regulatory requirements 
when we receive a notice of non compliance  we take action to achieve compliance and work with authorities to satisfactorily resolve the issues 
the associated costs have not had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to maintain compliance with applicable environmental requirements  if damage to persons or the environment arises from hazardous substances used  generated or disposed of in the conduct of our business or that of our predecessors to the extent we are not indemnified therefor  we may be held liable for certain damages and for the costs of the investigation and remediation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in view of the potential financial effect such environmental liabilities could have  when we acquired the assets of our predecessor from allied in january  we secured an obligation from allied to indemnify us from undisclosed environmental liabilities resulting from conditions existing as of the closing date 
with the exception of four sites disclosed by allied at the time of the acquisition  allied has accepted indemnification responsibility for our potential liabilities at those third party owned or operated sites with respect to which we have been named as a prp by the united states environmental protection agency epa or state environmental agencies under the federal superfund law or comparable state environmental laws 
in march we received notification of our potential involvement at an additional site  which occurred after the acquisition from allied 
with respect to the four sites not covered by the allied indemnity and the site referred to in the preceding paragraph  based upon the most currently available information  we believe that our share of liability at these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  we accrue reserves for environmental liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and periodically reevaluate the reserved amounts for these liabilities in view of the most current information available 
we are also aware of the existence of potential contamination at two of our properties which may require expenditures for further investigation and remediation 
at our huguenot  new york facility  fluoride contamination in an inactive lagoon exceeding the state s groundwater standards  which existed prior to our acquisition of the site  has resulted in the site being listed on the registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal sites maintained by the new york state department of environmental conservation 
the prior owner of the site  avnet  inc  ultimately may bear some  as yet undetermined  share of the costs associated with this matter 
our conyers  georgia facility is listed on the georgia state hazardous sites inventory 
soil at the site  which was likely contaminated from a leaking underground acid neutralization tank and possibly storm water runoff  has been excavated and disposed of 
a hydrogeologic study was undertaken to assess the impact to groundwater 
that study did not reveal any groundwater impact 
assessment and remediation of off site contamination was completed and the full remediation report was submitted to the state in february we have received verbal confirmation from the state environmental agency that no further action will be required and that the site will be removed from its hazardous sites inventory 
together with jci  we are conducting an assessment and remediation of contamination at our milwaukee  wisconsin facility  which we purchased as part of our acquisition of the specialty battery division from jci 
the majority of this project is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal under the purchase agreement with jci  we are responsible for i one half of the cost of the on site assessment and remediation  with a maximum liability of  ii any environmental liabilities at the facility that are not remediated as part of the current project and iii environmental liabilities for claims made after the fifth anniversary of the closing that arise from migration from a pre closing condition at the milwaukee facility to locations other than the milwaukee facility  but specifically excluding liabilities relating to pre closing offsite disposal 
jci has retained all other environmental liabilities  including off site assessment and remediation 
we received notification from the epa of alleged violations of permit effluent and pretreatment discharge limits at our plant in attica  indiana 
we have submitted a compliance plan to the epa 
a penalty assessment could be made  however there is insufficient information currently available to permit us to estimate our potential liability  if any 
with respect to each of the properties described in the preceding four paragraphs  we have accrued a reserve in our consolidated financial statements for our estimate of the potential costs and liabilities 
the costs and potential liabilities associated with these matters are not  in our opinion  likely to materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are working towards iso certification at our blue bell  pennsylvania headquarters  certain associated departments located in conshohocken  pennsylvania and our conyers  georgia manufacturing facility 
iso is a voluntary  international standard that is intended to provide organizations with the elements of an effective environmental management system that can be integrated with other management requirements to assist with the achievement of environmental and economic goals

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands  except per share amounts and per pound lead amounts 
impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal  primarily due to continued positive economic conditions  there was a higher demand for our standby power products sold by the powercom and dynasty divisions and higher demand for dc to dc converters sold by our power electronics division 
due to deteriorating economic conditions  demand for products sold by the power electronics division has softened during the first quarter of fiscal  particularly with respect to the division s largest customer 
raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal  and  the average north american producer price of lead was  
and 
per pound  respectively 
we have a long term cost containment program to maximize manufacturing efficiency 
under the program  we continue to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the cost to us of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o increases in labor productivity  o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiencies  and o price increases of our products 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated

minority interest of in fiscal reflects the percent ownership interest in the joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china that is not owned by c d 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income increased  or percent to  or per common share basic and per common share assuming dilution 
the above per share amounts reflect our june  two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
restructuring charge during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of  or 
per share after tax as adjusted for our june  two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend  primarily relating to the restructuring of the power electronics division 
of this pre tax charge   was included in selling  general and administrative expenses  with the remaining included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended january  the restructuring charge consisted of estimated costs to close our costa mesa  california power supply production facility as well as contractual severance liabilities associated with the non renewal of the employment contracts of two of our former officers 
with respect to the closing of the costa mesa  california production facility  we implemented a restructuring plan that consisted of transferring production primarily to our existing facility in nogales  mexico 
major actions of the restructuring plan consisted of i disposition of inventory  ii write off of impaired property  plant and equipment that was not transferred to other facilities  and iii termination of the power electronics division s costa mesa  california workforce 
restructuring activity for the years ended january  and was as follows balance at balance at january  provision january  cash reductions reduction employee severance total april balance at non cash january  provision cash reductions activity write off of inventory write down of property  plant and equipment employee severance other total  the inventory write off was determined based upon identification of inventory associated with discontinued products 
this inventory was disposed of during the second quarter of fiscal the write down of impaired property  plant and equipment was determined based upon the estimated cost to completely write down the net book value of assets not transferred to other facilities 
we completed the disposition of the impaired property  plant and equipment during the third quarter of fiscal employee severance of was charged to selling  general and administrative expenses and provided for a reduction of approximately employees  consisting of production and administrative employees related to the power electronics division s costa mesa  california facility  and two former officers of c d 
all power electronics employee terminations were completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal  with payments being made in accordance with contractual agreements through fiscal liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities increased  or percent to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net income  depreciation and amortization 
also contributing was the change in deferred taxes and a smaller increase in accounts receivable during the current year 
these changes  resulting in higher net cash provided by operating activities  were partially offset by an overall increase in working capital 
net cash used by investing activities totaling  for fiscal includes our acquisition of ncl 
net cash used by investing activities of  in fiscal included the acquisition of the specialty battery division of jci and the acquisition of jci s percent ownership interest in a joint venture battery business located in shanghai  china 
in fiscal  acquisition of property  plant and equipment increased  or percent over the prior year  primarily for capacity expansions 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
the proceeds from new borrowings in fiscal and were primarily used to fund the aforementioned acquisitions 
net cash used for financing activities during fiscal also includes the purchase of  of treasury stock 
the availability under our current loan agreement is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures and possible strategic acquisitions 
this agreement contains restricted covenants that require us to maintain minimum ratios such as fixed charges coverage and leverage ratios  as well as minimum consolidated net worth 
we were in compliance with our loan agreement covenants at january  capital expenditures during fiscal were incurred primarily to fund capacity expansion  new product development  a continuing series of cost reduction programs  normal maintenance capital and regulatory compliance 
fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  for similar purposes 
conversion to the euro currency on january   the euro was adopted as the common legal currency for european union member nations  in coexistence with the national currencies of these member nations until january  we have made necessary adjustments to our processes to ensure compliance during the three year transitional period that ends january  after this transitional period  the euro becomes the sole legal currency for the european union member nations and all of our records of the national currencies will be converted to the euro equivalent at that time 
we do not expect the euro adoption to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  sfas no 
was issued which includes several amendments to sfas no 
the new standard is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
 including the amendments in sfas no 
 on february  the new standard requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at their fair values 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset on the income statement by changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of any hedge is reported in other comprehensive income until it is cleared to earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in current earnings each period 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as a hedge will be recorded each period in current earnings 
using market valuations for derivatives held as of january   as a guide  we determined that on february   the cumulative effect adjustment to net income and accumulated other comprehensive loss was not material 
at this time  we plan no significant change in our risk management strategies due to the adoption of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
market risk factors we are exposed to various market risks 
the primary financial risks include fluctuations in interest rates and changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage these risks by using derivative instruments 
we do not invest in derivative securities for trading purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates as well as to fluctuations in exchange rates 
see derivative financial instruments in the summary of significant accounting policies  note  and fair value of financial instruments  note to the consolidating financial statements 
our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate swap contracts 
the net market value of our debt instruments excluding capital lease obligations was  and  at january  and  respectively 
the debt instruments are subject to variable rate interest and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts are used to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our underlying variable rate debt instruments 
we employ separate swap transactions rather than fixed rate obligations to take advantage of the lower borrowing costs associated with floating rate debt while also eliminating possible risk related to refinancing in the fixed rate market 
the net market value of our interest rate swaps was and  at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in a and an increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in a and an decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
we calculate the market value of the interest rate swaps by utilizing a standard net present value model based on the market conditions as of the valuation date 
we use currency forwards and swaps to hedge anticipated cash flows in foreign currencies 
the exposures currently hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
these financial instruments represent a net market value of and at january  and  respectively 
to monitor our currency exchange rate risk  we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on earnings in the case of a percent devaluation of the british pound  canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso to the us dollar 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous percent change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a percent strengthening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in an increase of the net market value of the forwards and swaps of  and  respectively 
at january  and  a percent weakening of the us dollar versus these currencies would result in a decrease in the net market value of the forwards and swaps of  and  respectively 
the market value of the instruments was determined by taking into consideration the contracted interest rates and foreign exchange rates versus those available for similar maturities in the market at january  and  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards and swap contracts are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either a balance sheet or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
