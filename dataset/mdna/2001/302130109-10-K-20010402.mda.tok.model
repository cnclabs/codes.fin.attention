item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto contained elsewhere within this report 
results of operations the following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the company s principal services and the company s expenses for  and  expressed as percentages of net revenues 
with respect to the company s services other than freight consolidation  net revenues are identical to revenues 
management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the company s principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company

airfreight margins expanded approximately during as compared with higher freight volumes and efficient consolidations of dense and fluffy volumetric freight allowed the company to maximize purchased transportation costs while still offering competitive rates to customers 
the company s north american export airfreight net revenues increased in compared to airfreight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with airfreight rates on far east to north american trade lanes  the company s most dominant lane  remained strong throughout ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to ocean freight demand remained strong throughout and ocean freight rates from the far east  the company s largest trade lane  increased in the last half of the year 
during  management continued to expand market share  increase ocean tonnage  and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers 
changes in the regulatory environment in the united states created new opportunities for the company s nvocc operations to provide services to customers who had previously dealt directly with the ocean carriers 
margins remained nearly constant in as compared with expeditors cargo management systems ecms  a pc based ocean freight consolidation management and purchase order tracking service  continued to be instrumental in attracting new business 
the company s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and  to a lesser extent  from north america to europe 
ocean freight net revenues from the far east and from europe increased and  respectively  for compared with customs brokerage and import services revenues increased in as compared with as a result of the company s growing reputation for providing high quality service  consolidation within the customs brokerage market as customers seek out customs brokers with more sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program  and the growing importance of distribution services as a separate and distinct service offered to existing and potential customers 
distribution services accounted for nearly of the increase in customs brokerage and import services revenues for compared with salaries and related costs increased in compared to as a result of the company s increased hiring of sales  operations  and administrative personnel in existing and new offices to accommodate increases in business activity and increased compensation levels 
salaries and related costs decreased as a percentage of net revenues 
management believes that this decrease is due to the company s ability to service larger freight volumes with a relatively smaller group of people 
management attributes this to technological enhancement and operational process improvement initiatives 
the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee 
using this compensation model  changes in individual compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company profits 
management believes that the growth in revenues  net revenues and net earnings for are a result of the incentives inherent in the company s compensation program 
other operating expenses increased in as compared with as rent expense  communications expense  quality and training expenses  and other costs expanded to accommodate the company s growing operations 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in as compared with other income  net  increased in as compared to primarily due to interest income earned on higher cash balances and short term investments in management attributes higher cash balances  in large part  to the success of cash management and billing improvement initiatives 
the company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as other taxes which are typically included in costs of operations 
the company s consolidated effective income tax rate remained relatively constant in at

during  management continued to expand market share  increase ocean tonnage  and increase net ocean freight revenues while offering competitive market rates to customers 
margins diminished slightly as a result of this increased demand and due to regulatory constraints which restricted the company s ability to promptly pass carrier rate increases to nvocc customers 
ecms continued to be instrumental in attracting new business 
the company s north american export ocean freight net revenues increased in compared to this increase was a result of the company handling more ocean shipments moving from north america to the far east and  to a lesser extent  from north america to europe

currency and other risk factors international air ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry  however  the company s primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group 
while there is currently a marked trend within the industry toward consolidation into large firms with multinational offices and agency networks  regional and local broker forwarders remain a competitive force 
historically  the primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry have been price and quality of service  including reliability  responsiveness  expertise  convenience  and scope of operations 
the company emphasizes quality service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry 
recently  customers have exhibited a trend towards more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of the logistics supply chain by embracing strategies such as just in time inventory management 
accordingly  sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers 
developing these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers 
smaller and middle tier competitors  in general  do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network 
as a result  there is a significant amount of consolidation currently taking place in the industry 
management expects that this trend toward consolidation will continue for the short to medium term 
the nature of the company s worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar 
this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of the international currency markets and governmental interference 
some of the countries where the company maintains offices and or agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the company s ability to hedge foreign currency exposure 
the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting standards for derivative and hedging transactions and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this standard by the company on january   had no material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the company s ability to move money freely around the world or the short term financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most time sensitive way to avoid short term exchange losses 
any such hedging activity during  and was insignificant 
net foreign currency gains realized during were  net foreign currency gains realized in were  net foreign currency losses realized in were  the company has traditionally generated revenues from airfreight  ocean freight and customs brokerage and import services 
in light of the customer driven trend to provide customer rates on a door to door basis  management foresees the potential  in the medium to long term  for fees normally associated with customs house brokerage to be de emphasized and included as a component of other services offered by the company 
on january   eleven of fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and a new common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
the conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company has established plans to address the issues raised by the euro currency conversion including the need to adapt computer systems and business processes to accommodate euro denominated transactions 
since existing financial systems currently accommodate multiple currencies  the plans contemplate full conversion by the end of the company does not expect the conversion costs to be material and is actively pursuing conversion plans and initiatives to fully accommodate the introduction of the euro as the financial reporting currency of the member states 
due to numerous uncertainties  the company is evaluating the effects one common european currency will have on pricing 
the company is unable to predict the resulting impact  if any  on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company had not experienced any significant disruption as a result of this phased conversion 
sources of growth historically  growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the company s competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill  the value of which can be realized in large measure only by retaining the customers and profit margins of the acquired business 
as a result  the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions  where future economic benefit significantly exceeds the goodwill recorded in the transaction

internal growth management believes that a comparison of same store growth is critical in the evaluation of the quality and extent of the company s internally generated growth 
this same store analysis isolates the financial contributions from offices that have been included in the company s operating results for at least one full year 
the table below presents same store comparisons on a year over year basis for the years ended december   and same store comparisons for the years ended december  net revenues operating income liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared with million for the same period of this million increase is principally due to a smaller increase in accounts receivable million between and than was experienced between and management believes that the smaller increase in accounts receivable is due to internal initiatives to increase the quality and timeliness of customer billings  which in turn improved the rate of customer collections 
the company also did a more effective job in of matching cash outflows with inflows 
this resulted in a million increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and taxes payable in over the increase in the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality 
historically  the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings 
this results in positive cash flow 
the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections 
this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cash 
in the past  the company has utilized short term borrowings to satisfy normal operating expenditures when temporary cash outflows exceed cash inflows 
these short term borrowings have been repaid when the trend reverses and customer collections exceed customer billings 
during  short term borrowings were not required in the united states  the market where cash flow pressures are most intense due to funds advanced in association with customs brokerage activity 
as a customs broker  the company makes significant business day cash advances for the payment of duties and freight 
these advances are made as an accommodation for a select group of credit worthy customers 
cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense  but are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
as a result of these pass through billings  the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared with million during the same period of the largest use of cash in investing activities is cash paid for capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   the company made capital expenditures of million as compared with million for the same period in capital expenditures in and in related primarily to investments in technology and office furniture and equipment 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million as compared with cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in in  the company paid down million on short term debt  as compared with an increase in short term debt of million that occurred during the same period of the company uses the proceeds from stock option exercises to repurchase the company s stock on the open market 
the differences shown at year end of and between proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the amounts paid to repurchase common stock represent a timing difference in the receipt of proceeds and the subsequent repurchase of outstanding shares 
at december   working capital was million  including cash and short term investments of million 
the company had no long term debt at december  while the nature of its business does not require an extensive investment in property and equipment  the company cannot eliminate the possibility that it could acquire an equity interest in property in certain geographic locations 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million on property and equipment in in addition to normal capital expenditures for leasehold improvements  warehouse equipment  computer hardware and furniture and fixtures  this total includes estimates for building projects in egypt  ireland and malaysia 
the company expects to finance capital expenditures in  with cash 
the company borrows internationally and domestically under unsecured bank lines of credit 
the us facility totals million and international bank lines of credit totaled million 
in addition  the company maintains a bank facility with its uk bank for million 
at december   the company was directly liable for million drawn on these lines of credit and was contingently liable for an additional million from standby letters of credit 
management believes that the company s current cash position  bank financing arrangements  and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
in some cases  the company s ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls 
in addition  certain undistributed earnings of the company s subsidiaries accumulated through december  would  under most circumstances  be subject to some additional united states income tax if distributed to the company 
the company has not provided for this additional tax because the company intends to reinvest such earnings to fund the expansion of its foreign activities  or to distribute them in a manner in which no significant additional taxes would be incurred 
impact of inflation to date  the company s business has not been adversely affected by inflation  nor has the company experienced significant difficulty in passing carrier rate increases on to its customers by means of price increases 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term period 
due to the high degree of competition in the market place  these rate increases might lead to an erosion in the company s margins 
however  as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest rate sensitive indebtedness  the company currently has no direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest rates 
the forward looking statements contained in this document involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements include  but are not limited to risks associated with foreign operations  elimination of intercompany transactions  matching of expenses with the associated revenue  seasonality  shifts in consumer demand  the effect that the adoption of the euro as the primary currency of member states of the european union might have on the global economy and the company s international and domestic customers  other accounting estimates and other risk factors disclosed from time to time in the company s public reports 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business 
these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in short term interest rates 
the potential impact of the company s exposure to these risks is presented below foreign exchange risk the company conducts business in many different countries and currencies 
the company s business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred 
in the ordinary course of business  the company creates numerous intercompany transactions 
this brings a market risk to the company s earnings 
foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the company s earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar  the company s functional currency  relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business 
all other things being equal  an average weakening of the us dollar  throughout the year ended december   would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately million 
an average strengthening of the us dollar  for the same period  would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately million 
the company has approximately million of intercompany transactions unsettled at any one point in time 
the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the company s ability to move money freely around the world 
any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december   was insignificant 
the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings 
the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within days and intercompany billings arising in the normal course of business are fully settled within days 
interest rate risk at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million and short term borrowings of million  all subject to variable short term interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate of would have an insignificant impact on the company s earnings 
in management s opinion  there has been no material change in the company s market risk exposure between and
