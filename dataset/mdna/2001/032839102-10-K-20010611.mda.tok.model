results of operations comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary component of this increase in earnings for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a decrease of million in non interest expense 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in net interest income after the provision for loan losses 
the returns on average assets and average stockholders equity for fiscal were 
and  respectively  as compared to 
and  respectively  for fiscal net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million during fiscal due to increases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities increased to billion and billion in fiscal  respectively  from billion and billion  respectively  in fiscal the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the average yield on interest earning assets in fiscal versus in fiscal increased  as did the average cost on interest bearing liabilities in fiscal versus in fiscal 
the net interest margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal and the interest rate spread decreased to from for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin is reflective of an increase in the cost of funds  offset by increased yields on loans as rates rise 
these factors are reflected in the analysis of changes in net interest income  arising from changes in the volume of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities 
the analysis indicates that the increases in the volume of interest earning liabilities decreased net interest income in fiscal by approximately million 
in addition  there was a million decrease in net interest income caused by the combination of rate and rate volume changes 
provision for loan losses 
provision for loan losses decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal based on management s ongoing evaluation of asset quality 
there was a slight increase in net charge offs of  in overall loans in fiscal  primarily due to increased mortgage loan charge offs  and the quality of the loan portfolio continues to be good 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased slightly from million at march  to million at march  this amount represented 
of total loans at march   as compared to of total loans at march  for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition allowance for loan and foreclosure losses 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal primarily due to the decrease of million in net income from operations of real estate investments 
this decrease was largely due to decreased resort and golf net income at the partnerships and losses on the sale of four condominium units in a development in bloomington  minnesota 
other non interest income  which includes a variety of loan fee and other miscellaneous fee income  also decreased  for fiscal partially offsetting these decreases were increases in other categories 
the net gain on sale of loans increased by million largely due to increased volume of loan sales during the year 
service charges on deposits increased  essentially due to a growth in deposits and loan servicing income increased  due to increased volume of loans serviced for others 
income from insurance commissions increased  due to increased sales and net gain on sale of investments and securities increased  for fiscal non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of several factors 
the majority of the decrease was attributed to merger related expenses of million million  net of tax due to the merger with fcbf and increased goodwill expense of million million net of tax in fiscal unamortized goodwill from a previous merger became impaired and was written off in fiscal exclusive of the one time charges for the merger and goodwill  non interest expense increased  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million  largely due to an increase in incentive compensation resulting from increased loan production 
in addition  occupancy expense increased  during this fiscal year 
there was an increase in furniture and equipment expense of  in fiscal  primarily due to normal replacement costs  and data processing expense increased  these increases were partially offset by decreases in other categories 
other non interest expense decreased  due to decreases in postage  retail and other expenses and federal insurance premiums decreased  due to a reduction in the assessment in fiscal also  marketing expense decreased  due to decreased promotions 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the unusual effective tax rate for fiscal is a result of certain merger related costs and goodwill amortization that are not deductible for tax purposes

rate volume analysis the most significant impact on the corporation s net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of earning dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in net interest income between periods 
the following table shows the relative contribution of the changes in average volume and average interest rates on changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the bank made dividend payments of million to the corporation 
the bank is subject to certain regulatory limitations relative to its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that the corporation will not be adversely affected by these dividend limitations and that projected future dividends from the bank will be sufficient to meet the corporation s liquidity needs 
in addition to dividends from the bank  the corporation also could sell capital stock or debt issues through the capital markets as alternative sources of funds  as well as obtain loans from outside banks 
the bank s primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable and mortgage related securities  sales of mortgage loans originated for sale  fhlb advances  deposits and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage related securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank is required by the ots to maintain levels of liquid investments in qualifying types of us government and agency securities and other investments sufficient to ensure its safe and sound operation 
at march  and  the bank s liquidity ratio was and  respectively 
in fiscal  operating activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
operating cash flows for fiscal included earnings of million and million of net proceeds from the origination and sale of mortgage loans held for sale 
investing activities in fiscal resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
primary investing activities resulting in cash outflows were million for the purchase of securities and million for the increase in net loans receivable 
the most significant cash inflows from investing activities were principal payments of million received on mortgage related securities  as well as million from the proceeds of sales and maturities of investment securities 
financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of million including a net increase in deposits of million  a net increase in borrowings of million and a cash outflow of million for treasury stock purchases 
at march   the corporation had outstanding commitments to originate million of loans  commitments to extend funds to or on behalf of customers pursuant to lines and letters of credit of million  and million of loans sold with recourse to the corporation in the event of default by the borrower 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following march  amounted to million  and scheduled maturities of borrowings during the same period totaled million 
the bank has entered into agreements with certain brokers that will provide blocks of funds at specified interest rates for an identified fee 
management believes adequate capital and borrowings are available from various sources to fund all commitments to the extent required 
at march   the bank s capital exceeded all capital requirements of the ots as mandated by federal law and regulations on both a current and fully phased in basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition general 
total assets of the corporation increased million or from billion at march  to billion at march  this increase was primarily funded by net increases in deposits of million  and borrowings of million 
these funds were generally invested in loans receivable and mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities 
mortgage related securities both available for sale and held to maturity increased million as a net result during the year of i purchases of million  ii principal repayments and market value adjustments of million and iii sales of million 
mortgage related securities consisted of million of mortgage backed securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity and million of mortgage derivative securities million were available for sale and million were held to maturity at march  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
mortgage related securities are subject to inherent risks based upon the future performance of the underlying collateral ie  mortgage loans for these securities 
among these risks are prepayment risk and interest rate risk 
should general interest rate levels decline  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i prepayments as borrowers typically would seek to obtain financing at lower rates  ii a decline in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  and iii an increase in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities 
conversely  should general interest rate levels increase  the mortgage related securities portfolio would be subject to i a longer term to maturity as borrowers would be less likely to prepay their loans  ii an increase in interest income received on adjustable rate mortgage related securities  iii a decline in fair value of fixed rate mortgage related securities  and iv a decline in fair value of adjustable rate mortgage related securities to an extent dependent upon the level of interest rate increases  the time period to the next interest rate repricing date for the individual security  and the applicable periodic annual and or lifetime cap which could limit the degree to which the individual security could reprice within a given time period 
loans receivable 
total net loans including loans held for sale increased million during fiscal from billion at march   to billion at march  the activity included i originations and purchases of billion  ii sales of million  and iii principal repayments and other reductions of million 
see note to the corporation s consolidated financial statements for more information 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consisting of non accrual loans  non performing real estate held for development and sale  foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million or of total assets at march  from million or of total assets at march  non performing assets are summarized as follows for the dates indicated at march  dollars in thousands non accrual loans single family residential      multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and land consumer commercial business total non accrual loans      real estate held for development and sale     foreclosed properties and repossessed assets  net  total non performing assets      performing troubled debt restructurings total non accrual loans to total loans total non performing assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to total non accrual loans allowance for loan and foreclosure losses to total non performing assets non accrual loans increased million in fiscal this increase is largely attributable to one single family property 
at march   there was one non accrual single family loan with a carrying value of greater than million 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
as a matter of policy  the corporation does not accrue interest on loans past due more than days 
non performing real estate held for development and sale decreased million during fiscal at march   there were no properties in non performing real estate held for development and sale with a carrying value greater than million 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased  in fiscal this increase is not attributable to any one property 
at march   there are no properties in foreclosed properties with a carrying value greater than million 
the total of performing troubled debt restructurings does not represent a material amount and does not include any loans larger than million 
allowances for loan and foreclosure losses 
the corporation s loan portfolio  foreclosed properties  and repossessed assets are evaluated on a continuing basis to determine the necessity for additions to the allowances for losses and the related balance in the allowances 
these evaluations consider several factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  collateral value  loan portfolio composition  loan delinquencies  prior loss experience  anticipated loss of interest and losses inherent in the portfolio 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of known loan problems as well as potential loan problems based upon historical trends and ratios 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses prior to transfer to foreclosed property 
the fair value is primarily based on appraisals  discounted cash flow analysis the majority of which are based on current occupancy and lease rates and pending offers 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses follows year ended march  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of year      charge offs mortgage  consumer   commercial business total charge offs      recoveries mortgage consumer commercial business total recoveries net charge offs    provision    acquired banks allowances  allowance at end of year      net charge offs to average loans held for sale and for investment the fiscal provision for loan losses totaled  compared to million in fiscal the provision for loan losses for fiscal years and remain at significantly lower levels compared to earlier years when the bank s charge off experience from certain portfolio segments required larger allowances due to higher defaults during a period of economic downturn 
those segments were largely multi family real estate loans secured by properties in states other than wisconsin and leases receivable 
the corporation had  until the past few years  substantially ceased extending credit in those segments since the late s 
because of this historical experience  and based on the volume and type of lending reintroduced to the loan portfolio in the real estate held for development and sale segment  management considered it appropriate to retain the allowance at its present level 
for further discussion of the real estate held for development and sale segment  see
