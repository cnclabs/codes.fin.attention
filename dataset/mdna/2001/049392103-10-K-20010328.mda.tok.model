general our principal business objective is to generate income for distribution to our unitholders from the transportation of natural gas through our gathering systems 
we completed an initial public offering of our common units in february and used the proceeds of that offering to acquire the gathering systems formerly owned by atlas america  inc and its affiliates  all subsidiaries of resource america  inc the acquisition agreement provided that operations of the gathering systems from and after january  would be for our account and  accordingly  we deem january  to be the commencement of our operations 
the gathering systems gather natural gas from wells in eastern ohio  western new york  and western pennsylvania and transport the natural gas primarily to public utility pipelines 
to a lesser extent  the gathering systems transport natural gas to end users 
the results of operations discussed below are for the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth the average volumes transported  transportation rates and revenues received by us for the year ended december  average daily throughput volumes mcf  average transportation rate 
total transportation and compression revenues  in units of  cubic feet mcf 
year ended december  revenues 
our primary source of income for the year ended december  was transportation and compression revenue 
the two variables which affect transportation and compression revenue are o the volumes of natural gas  expressed in thousands of cubic feet  or mcfs  that go through our gathering system  and o the transportation rate per mcf paid to us under our master natural gas gathering agreement 
during the year ended december   our average daily throughput volume increased from  mcfs in the quarter ended march  to  mcfs in the quarter ended september   an increase of  mcf 
fourth quarter throughput decreased to  mcfs  a decrease of  mcfs  due to early severe winter weather and the associated use of house gas 
our average transportation rate increased from 
in the quarter ended march  to 
in the quarter ended december   an increase of 

the increase in average daily throughput volume resulted from additional volumes associated with wells drilled by atlas america 
the increase in our average transportation rate was caused by the increase in average natural gas prices received by atlas america for wells transported through our system  which were per mcf during the first quarter of fiscal and per mcf during the fourth quarter of fiscal  an increase of or 
although natural gas prices have risen during the current year  there can be no assurances as to the future demand for or price of natural gas 
interest income of  consists of interest earned on funds temporarily invested in short term money market accounts 
during the year ended december   we incurred expenses of million consisting primarily of million of transportation and compression expense relating to transporting natural gas through our pipeline   of general and administrative expense  consisting primarily of reimbursements to our general partner for salaries and benefits  professional services including audit  tax consulting  insurance and legal fees  and million of depreciation and amortization expense 
liquidity and capital resources since commencement of operations  the principal source of our capital resources has been the initial offering of our common units which after offering costs and underwriting discounts and commissions  resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
secondarily  we received transportation and compression revenue  and  in october  obtained a million revolving credit facility 
at december   our current ratio was to net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  principally derived from million of income before depreciation and amortization 
changes in current assets and current liabilities resulted in a net cash use of million which includes our transportation receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december   principally for our acquisition  in february  of the gathering systems 
at december  property and equipment was approximately of total consolidated assets 
capital expenditures  other than for the initial acquisition of the gathering system were million for the year ended december   principally consisting of costs relating to expansion of our existing gathering systems as a result of new wells connected to our system and compressor upgrades 
we anticipate capital expenditures for of million which we expect to fund from cash generated by operations and our line of credit 
these capital expenditures will go for further expansions of our gathering systems and to improve our facilities by replacing existing lines and upgrading our compressors 
as of december   however  we did not have any specific commitments to make any capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures could increase materially from our estimate if the number of wells connected to our gathering systems in fiscal exceeds our current estimate 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   consisting of the proceeds from our initial public offering offset principally by net distributions to unitholders and our general partner of million and by  of costs related to our formation 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility in october for a description of the terms of this facility  you should read note to our financial statements 
our principal purpose in obtaining the facility was to help fund the expansion of our existing gathering systems  the acquisitions of other gas gathering systems and ongoing operations 
subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  in january and march  we used million and  of the facility to fund  in part  the acquisitions of a and a mile gas gathering system  respectively 
inflation and changes in prices inflation affects the operating expenses of the gathering systems 
increases in those expenses are not necessarily offset by increases in transportation rates that the gathering operations are able to charge 
we have not been materially affected by inflation because we were formed relatively recently and have only a limited period of operations 
while we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs  we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects 
in addition  the value of the gathering systems has been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations which we are unable to control or accurately predict 
environmental regulation a continuing trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has generally resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry 
we monitor environmental and safety laws and we believe are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  however  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we believe  however  that environmental and safety costs will increase in the future 
we cannot assure you that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our assets and liabilities are denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions 
we are subject to risks associated with the fluctuation of prices of natural gas see risk factors  page
