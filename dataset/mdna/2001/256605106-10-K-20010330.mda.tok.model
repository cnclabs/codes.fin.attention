in october  the eu general affairs council approved a proposal that calls for the continuation of import quotas with the rights to import bananas distributed on a first come  first served basis

sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance for rules regarding the recognition and presentation of revenue

fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established new accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to fas  which delayed the effective date of fas to december   and in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

fas requires that all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income 
recognition depends on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and on the type of hedge transaction cash flow or fair value 
gains or losses on derivative instruments recorded in other comprehensive income must be reclassified to income during the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges impacts earnings in the current period 
in order to adopt fas as of december   the first day of its fiscal year  the company undertook a comprehensive review of its contractual relationships to ensure that it had identified both free standing and embedded derivatives to be accounted for at fair value 
the company has historically not made extensive use of derivative instruments in its risk management activities 
as of december   the company s derivative instruments  both free standing and embedded  as defined by fas  were limited to certain minor warrants in privately held companies and foreign currency exchange forwards 
as such  the adoption of fas will not have a significant impact on the company s operating income  net income or equity 
in may  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives  which requires the cost of certain sales incentives  such as coupons  to be classified as a reduction of revenue rather than as marketing expense 
as required  the company anticipates adopting the provisions of eitf during the second quarter of the company currently accrues estimated coupon redemption costs as marketing expense at the time the coupon is distributed 
coupon accruals are subsequently reduced for actual redemptions as they are received 
coupon accruals are also adjusted periodically based on changes to redemption estimates 
in  accrued redemption expense  actual redemptions and reductions adjustments to redemption estimates totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the company anticipates approximately million of marketing expense related to planned coupon programs in the first part of the company does not anticipate any changes to the timing of cost recognition upon adoption of eitf therefore  the company expects the impact of such adoption will be limited to reclassifications  as a reduction of revenue  of related marketing expense  with no impact on its operating income or net income either prospectively or as currently or previously reported
