item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the operating companies  subsidiaries of exxon mobil corp 
and the royal dutch group  pay monthly royalties to the trust based on their sales of natural gas  sulfur and oil 
the oldenburg concession is the primary area from which these products are extracted and provides nearly of all the royalties received by the trust 
of these three products  natural gas provides approximately of the total royalties 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee and the managing director  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see item  legal proceedings  and note to financial statements contained herein 
the trust has no means of assuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which  with sales volumes  form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
with regard to the yk issue previously reported  there appears to have been no difficulties experienced by either the trust or its principal third parties 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal  the trust s gross royalty income increased from  to  the substantial increase in world oil prices experienced during continued to be reflected in the higher gas prices and accounted for the entire increase in the trust s royalties 
the shutdown for maintenance and repairs of the grossenkneten desulfurization plant during the fourth quarter accounted for the majority of the decline in gas sales 
the euro remained under pressure throughout the year and continued the decline in value begun shortly after its introduction in january the sustained increase in world oil prices during was reflected to a growing degree throughout the year in the price of gas sold under the overriding royalty agreements covering the oldenburg concession 
under the higher royalty rate agreement covering gas sales from western oldenburg  gas prices measured in pfennigs per kilowatt hour pf kwh climbed from pf kwh in the first quarter of fiscal to pf kwh in the fourth quarter  an increase of 
under the lower royalty rate agreement covering gas sales from the entire oldenburg concession  gas prices increased from pf kwh in the first quarter to pf kwh in the fourth quarter 
under both the higher and lower royalty rate agreements covering gas sales from the oldenburg concession  gas sales through the first nine months showed increases of and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter  however  the grossenkneten desulfurization plant experienced significant downtime while the operating companies conducted extensive maintenance and repair operations 
these operations following previous changes in the maintenance timetable were significantly more extensive than last year s and required a more complete suspension of production activity at the plant resulting in a significant decline in fourth quarter gas sales 
for the entire year under the higher and lower royalty rate agreements  gas sales declined to billion cubic feet bcf and to bcf  respectively 
with an effective royalty rate in western oldenburg seven times greater than the royalty rate in eastern oldenburg  changes in the percentage of sales originating from western oldenburg can have significant effects on the level of trust royalties 
the percentage of western sales to total sales declined in fiscal to from in fiscal since the bulk of gas extracted from wells located in western oldenburg is sour gas  the more extensive shutdown of the desulfurization plant in the fourth quarter disproportionately affected the level of western sales 
fiscal showed no relief from the continued decline in the value of the euro since shortly after its introduction in january after a brief respite in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the euro had four consecutive quarters of quarter to quarter declines 
based on the exchange rates utilized at the times of the various transfers of royalties from germany to the us  the average dollar equivalent value of the euro for the first quarter of fiscal was 
the average values for the second through fourth quarters were  and  respectively 
the euro s decline has continued into the first quarter of fiscal as well 
the impact on trust royalties of changes in the euro dollar exchange rates are twofold 
there is an immediate impact on trust royalties because at the end of every month german royalty payments are transferred to the united states and the exchange rate determines the amount of dollars the trust receives 
the long term impact is derived from the pricing mechanism which  in part  uses the price of light heating oil in germany to determine the price of gas sold under the various sales contracts 
the price of light heating oil  in turn  is affected by the price in dollars of oil on the international market 
over time  the short and long term impact of changes in the exchange rate tend to offset each other to varying degrees 
despite the decline in the exchange rates  when we apply the average exchange rates to gas prices in the various quarters  we see a steady increase through the year 
under the higher royalty rate agreement  gas prices began the year at the equivalent price of per mcf and finished the year at per mcf 
under the lower royalty rate agreement  gas prices began the year at the equivalent price of per mcf and finished the year at per mcf 
trust expenses increased from  to  primarily due to increased trustees fees which are controlled by provisions in the trust agreement based on trust royalties 
interest income increased from  to  primarily due to the increase in funds available for investment 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional and trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
management continues to believe that the number of such presentations will continue to be immaterial in the coming years 
in all events  after the year  pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears will be eliminated 
see note to financial statements contained herein for further information 
fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s royalty income declined to  the impact of significantly lower gas prices and a slightly lower average exchange rate caused the lower royalty income 
the decline in royalty income occurred despite the increase in overall gas sales 
reacting to the low oil prices in effect on the international market during the prior year  gas prices under both the higher and lower royalty rate agreements were lower in each quarter of fiscal when matched against the corresponding quarter in fiscal in the higher and lower rate royalty areas gas prices declined by and respectively 
this decline accounted for the bulk of the decline in royalties 
the average exchange rate for all royalties transferred to the united states from germany declined from the prior year 
for the year the average value of the euro was 
when we use the average exchange rates for the higher and lower royalty rate areas to convert gas prices measured in pfennigs per kwh into more familiar terms  we show average prices of and per mcf for the respective areas 
these prices compare to and per mcf for the same areas in the prior year 
the increase in overall gas sales was the only positive factor experienced during fiscal however  this increase was confined to the lower royalty rate area of eastern oldenburg and consequently had a limited impact on total trust royalties 
overall gas sales for the entire oldenburg concession increased from billion cubic feet bcf to bcf 
gas sales from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg actually declined by from bcf to bcf 
following a steady growth in the level of western sales as a percentage of total sales during the three prior years  western sales fell back to a level slightly below that of for the period western sales have accounted for  and of total oldenburg gas sales 
with an effective royalty rate in western oldenburg seven times greater than the royalty rate in eastern oldenburg changes in this ratio can have significant effects on the level of trust royalties 
with oldenburg gas sales accounting for more than of total trust royalties  non gas sulfur and oil and non oldenburg grosses meer royalties continue to have a declining impact 
the level of these royalties is shown in the tables on pages and of this report 
trust expenses declined from  to  primarily due to reduced trustee fees associated with the lower trust royalties 
interest income declined from  to  due to reduced funds available for investment 
during fiscal and respectively  an additional and trust units were issued and  and  were paid to former unlocated shareholders of north european oil corporation and north european oil company who presented shares for exchange or filed properly documented affidavits of loss and obtained an unlimited  open penalty indemnity bond 
management continues to believe that the number of such presentations will continue to be immaterial in the coming years 
in all events  after the year  pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   no further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears will be required
