basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted or exercised 
net income for the year was affected by the inclusion of  of gain from the sale of real estate located in jackson  mississippi 
premiums for the year  net of reinsurance ceded  were million  as compared to million for the year and million for the year this source of revenue is related to family life s traditional life insurance book of business  especially family life s decreasing term products 
the first year premiums for were relatively level with the decrease in first year premiums from to of million was related to higher level of new sales in the level of  renewal premiums for the year was million lower than for the year  and the level for the year was million lower that for the year the decrease in renewal premium is attributable to the decrease in the traditional life insurance book of business 
the net investment income was approximately level from to mainly due to the long term portfolio remaining level while short term investments were decreasing and the short term rates were increasing 
the net investment income for was million as compared to million in there was a decrease of approximately million from to earned insurance charges for were million  as compared to million in and million in this source of revenue is related to the universal life insurance and annuity book of business of family life 
the amount is consistently decreasing because family life insurance company reinsures all of its universal life and annuity business with investors na 
as a result  earned insurance charges are affected by a decreasing block of business 
policyholder benefits and expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in the  increase in policyholder benefits and expenses from to is due to an increase in policyholder expenses 
the million decrease in policyholder benefits and expenses from to is due to a decrease in the reserves of million  which is related to a lower level of premiums  and an increase in death claims of million 
interest expense on contract holders deposit funds was million in each of the years and  as compared to million in this expense is related to the universal life book of business  which was a relatively level amount during the three year period 
in  the amortization of present value of future profits of acquired business was million as compared to million in and million in the amortization of present value of future profits decreased by million in to and  from to these decreases in amortization were expected and should continue to decrease as the underlying asset  present value of future profits decreases 
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in amortization of  from to can be attributed to the capitalization of expenses incurred in connection with the writing of new business 
the operating expenses for were million  as compared to million on and million in the decrease in operating expenses of  from to is due to a reduction of overall operating expenses in and the reduction of yk conversion expenses incurred in as compared to s expenses 
the experience of level expenses from to was due to a reduction of overall operating expenses in offset by the additional costs relating to the yk conversion 
interest expense for was million  as compared to million in and million in the continued decrease of interest expenses from to is consistent with the scheduled pay down of fic s debt to investors na 
the provision for federal income taxes was million in as compared to million in and million in the provision for federal income taxes for the years and is substantially lower that for  due to the utilization in and of the small company deduction by family life insurance company 
that deduction was not available to family life in the year under the applicable federal income tax rules 
the availability of the deduction reduced federal income taxes by  in and  in results of operations three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  for the three month period ended december   fic s net income was million basic and diluted earnings of per common share on revenues of million as compared to the net income of million basic earnings and diluted earnings of per common share on total revenues of million in the last three months of earnings per share are stated in accordance with the requirements of financial accounting standard fas no 
 which establishes two measures of earnings per share basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted or exercised 
equity in net income of intercontinental life corporation general prior to the acquisition of family life in june of  fic s primary involvement in the life insurance business was through its equity interest in ilco 
for the year  the company s equity in the net earnings of ilco  net of federal income tax  was   which was an increase as compared to  for the year and  for the year the increase in equity income from ilco of  from to is due to an increase in the percentage ownership fic has in ilco and is partially offset by a decrease in ilco s net income 
the equity income from ilco of  from to can be attributed to an increase in ilco s net income of million from to fic currently owns  shares of ilco s common stock 
in addition  family life currently owns  shares of ilco common stock 
as a result  fic currently owns  directly and indirectly through family life   shares approximately of ilco s common stock 
fic carries its investment in ilco on the equity method of accounting 
at december   fic s investment in affiliate was valued at million 
the book value of ilco s common stock at december  was per share  which is substantially above the market value of ilco s common stock on that same date 
the applicable accounting standards permit fic to carry its investment in ilco on the equity method of accounting  without any adjustment to reflect the difference between book value and market value 
under certain circumstances  accounting principles board opinion apb and staff accounting bulletin topic m sab m require an adjustment to earnings where the value of an investment is deemed to have decreased on an other than a temporary basis 
application of the other than temporary provisions of apb and sab m to fic s investment in ilco would potentially result in a charge to earnings in some future period 
the amount of such charge would be based primarily upon the market price of ilco s common stock  which ranged from per share to per share during the first quarter of based on that range of market prices  the range of possible impairment charges which might result would be from million to million  net of tax 
however  management believes that an adjustment to earnings is neither required nor appropriate under the provisions of apb and sab m in addition  management notes that fic and ilco are currently parties to an agreement and plan of merger whereby ilco would become a wholly owned subsidiary of fic 
fic believes that it is probable that the merger will be consummated 
after the merger  fic will include ilco in its consolidated financial statements 
fic expects to recover the cost of its investment in ilco from the realization of ilco s net assets through consolidation 
further  in the event that the merger transaction were not completed  ilco has the ability to resume its stock repurchase plan 
if ilco were to make additional purchases under that plan  the additional purchases would reduce the number of ilco s outstanding shares  thereby increasing the percentage of fic s ownership interest in ilco 
alternatively  fic could purchase shares of fic in the open market or in negotiated transactions to increase the percentage of its ownership in ilco 
in the event that the ownership percentage were to be increased to more than  fic would include ilco in its consolidated financial statements  which would produce the results described in the preceding paragraph 
in the event that none of the above described events were to occur and fic was required to recognize an earnings charge for an other than temporary impairment  the ability of fic to record on an equity basis its interest in the net earnings of ilco may be limited by the future market value of ilco s common stock 
since the amount of any such adjustments would be dependent upon the future market value of ilco s common stock  fic s management is not able to estimate the potential range of charges which might occur in future periods 
the decrease in long term interest rates during the last part of the year  which was related to general economic conditions  had a positive effect upon the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment of ilco s investment portfolio 
as of december   the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment was million as compared to an amortized cost of million  or an unrealized gain of million 
since fic owns approximately of the common stock of ilco  such unrealized gains  net of tax  are reflected in fic s investment in affiliate and accumulated other comprehensive income  and had the effect of increasing the reported value of such equity interest by approximately million 
ilco s results for include  for the period beginning on june   the operations of grinnell life insurance company 
grinnell life was acquired on june   through a subsidiary of ilco  for an adjusted purchase price of million 
a portion of the purchase price million was paid by way of a dividend to the seller immediately prior to the closing of the transaction  the balance of the purchase price was paid by ilco s subsidiary 
as part of the transaction  grinnell life was immediately merged with and into that subsidiary  with that subsidiary being the surviving entity 
liquidity and capital resources of ilco liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
historically  our principal cash flow sources have been from periodic payment of principal and interest by investors na  pursuant to the terms of the surplus debentures 
in addition to the need for cash flow to meet operating expenses  our liquidity requirements relate principally to the liabilities associated with our various life insurance and annuity products 
our product liabilities include the payment of benefits under life insurance and annuity products  as well as the payment of policy surrenders  withdrawals and policy loans 
ilco is an insurance holding company 
the principal assets of ilco consist of the outstanding capital stock of investors na and its subsidiary  investors in 
prior to june   ilco s principal source of liquidity consisted of the periodic payment of principal and interest by investors na  pursuant to the terms of the surplus debentures 
the surplus debentures were originally issued by standard life insurance company and their terms were previously approved by the mississippi insurance commissioner 
in connection with the merger of standard life into investors na  the obligations of the surplus debentures were assumed by investors na 
as of june   the outstanding principal balance of the surplus debentures was completely paid off 
for periods subsequent to june   ilco s available source of liquidity is dividends paid to it from its subsidiaries 
applicable state insurance laws generally restrict the ability of insurance companies to pay cash dividends in excess of prescribed limitations without prior approval 
the ability of investors na to pay shareholder dividends is and will continue to be subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of washington  its domiciliary state 
the washington insurance law limits how and when investors na can pay shareholder dividends by including the greater of standard for payment of dividends to shareholders  and requiring that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
under the greater of standard  an insurer may pay a dividend in an amount equal to the greater of i of the policyholder surplus or ii the insurer s net gain from operations for the previous year 
as of december   investors na had earned surplus of million 
investors in is domiciled in the state of indiana 
under the indiana insurance code  a domestic insurer may make dividend distributions upon proper notice to the department of insurance  as long as the distribution is reasonable in relation to adequate levels of policyholder surplus and quality of earnings 
under indiana law the dividend must be paid from earned surplus 
extraordinary dividend approval would be required where a dividend exceeds the greater of of surplus or the net gain from operations for the prior fiscal year 
investors in had earned surplus of million at december  the form ks of ilco for the years ended december   and  set forth the business operations and financial results of ilco and its life insurance subsidiaries 
such k reports of ilco  including the discussion by ilco s management under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations are incorporated herein by reference 
liquidity and capital resources fic is a holding company whose principal assets consist of the common stock of family life and its equity ownership in ilco 
fic s primary sources of capital consists of cash flow from operations of its subsidiaries and the proceeds from bank and institutional borrowings 
the principal source of liquidity for fic s subsidiaries consists of the periodic payment of principal and interest by family life pursuant to the terms of a surplus debenture 
the terms of the surplus debenture were previously approved by the washington insurance commissioner 
under the provisions of the surplus debenture and current law  no prior approval of the washington insurance department is required for family life to pay interest or principal on the surplus debenture  provided that  after giving effect to such payments  the statutory surplus of family life is in excess of of assets the surplus floor 
however  family life has voluntarily agreed with the washington insurance commissioner that it will provide at least five days advance notice of payments which it will make under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the statutory capital and surplus of family life was million  an amount substantially in excess of the surplus floor 
during  family life made principal payments of million and interest payments of million to family life corporation under the surplus debenture 
as of december   the principal balance of the surplus debenture was million 
the funds required by family life to meet its obligations under the terms of the surplus debenture are generated primarily from premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
washington s insurance code includes the greater of standard for dividends but has requirements that prior notification of a proposed dividend be given to the washington insurance commissioner and that cash dividends may be paid only from earned surplus 
family life does not presently have earned surplus as defined by the regulations adopted by the washington insurance commissioner and  therefore  is not permitted to pay cash dividends 
however  since the new law applies only to dividend payments  the ability of family life to make principal and interest payments under the surplus debenture is not affected 
the company does not anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  family life will have any difficulty in making payments to family life corporation in amounts sufficient to enable family life corporation to service its indebtedness  either by payments of principal and interest by family life on the surplus debenture or partial redemptions by family life of its redeemable preferred stock 
the sources of funds for family life consist of premium payments from policyholders  investment income and the proceeds from the sale and redemption of portfolio investments 
these funds are applied primarily to provide for the payment of claims under insurance and annuity policies  operating expenses  taxes  investments in portfolio securities  shareholder dividends and payments under the provisions of the surplus debenture 
fic s net cash flow provided by operating activities was  for the year  as compared to million for the year and million in the decrease from to can be attributed to an increase in receivables of million in as compared to a million increase in this change is attributable to the reinsurance receivable from the universal life and annuity business reinsured by family life with investors na 
in addition  the change in cash flow provided by operating activities for the year was adversely affected by a decrease in the amortization of the present value of future profits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
net cash flow used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase for the year in cash used in financing activities is due to the cash dividend paid to the fic stockholders 
the guaranty commitments of fic under the loans incurred in connection with the acquisition of family life after taking into account the repayments and new loans which occurred in july  relate to i the million note issued by family life corporation to investors life insurance company of north america and ii the million loaned by investors na to two subsidiaries of fic 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of fic and its subsidiaries are sufficient to meet the needs of its business and to satisfy debt service 
investments as of december   the company s investment assets totaled million  as compared to million in the level of short term investments at the end of was million  as compared to million as of december  the fixed maturities available for sale portion represents million of investment assets as of december   as compared to million at the end of the amortized cost of fixed maturities available for sale as of december  was million representing a net unrealized gain of million 
this unrealized gain principally reflects changes in interest rates from the date of purchase of the related investments 
the decrease in long term interest rates during the last part of the year  which was related to general economic conditions  had a positive effect upon the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment of the company s portfolio 
as of december   the market value of the fixed maturities available for sale segment was million as compared to an amortized value of million  or a realized gain of million 
the assets held by family life must comply with applicable state insurance laws and regulations 
in selecting investments for the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiaries  the company s emphasis is to obtain targeted profit margins  while minimizing the exposure to changing interest rates 
this objective is implemented by selecting primarily short to medium term  investment grade fixed income securities 
in making such portfolio selections  the company generally does not select new investments which are commonly referred to as high yield or non investment grade 
the fixed maturities portfolio of family life  as of december   consisted solely of fixed maturities investments which  in the annual statements of the companies  as filed with state insurance departments  were designated under the national association of insurance commissioners naic rating system as a highest quality 
prior to december   fic owned several parcels of real estate in jackson  mississippi  adjacent to an office building known as the standard life building  which building was owned by investors na 
on december   investors na donated the standard life building to the jackson redevelopment authority jra 
contemporaneously with the donation of the standard life building  investors na and fic sold all of the adjacent parcels they owned to the jra for a total sale price of  which has been allocated according to the respective ownership interests of investors na approximately and fic approximately 
the donation and sale was made pursuant to the terms of the donation  purchase and sale agreement dated july  investors na claimed an income tax deduction on its tax return for the donation of the standard life building of  the donation and sale transaction referenced above resulted in a net of tax gain gaap basis of million for ilco and million for fic or a combined total of million in management believes that the absence of high yield or non investment grade investments as defined above in the portfolios of its life insurance subsidiary enhances the ability of the company to service its debt  provide security to its policyholders and to credit relatively consistent rates of return to its policyholders

the actions allege that a cash consideration in the proposed merger is unfair to the shareholders of ilco  that it would prevent the ilco shareholders from realizing the true value of ilco  and that fic and the named officers and directors had material conflicts of interest in approving the transaction 
in their initial pleadings  the plaintiffs sought certification of the cases as class actions and the named plaintiffs as class representatives  and among other relief  requested that the merger be enjoined or  if consummated  rescinded and set aside and that the defendants account to the class members for their damages

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
fic s principal assets are financial instruments  which are subject to market risks 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates  principally interest rates on fixed rate investments 
for a discussion of the company s investment portfolio and the management of that portfolio to reflect the nature of the underlying insurance obligations of the company s insurance subsidiaries  please refer to the sections entitled acquisition of ilco and investment of assets in item of this report and the information set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations investments 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk sensitive instruments 
it should be noted that this discussion has been developed using estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those described below 
further  the following discussion does not take into account actions which could be taken by management in response to the assumed changes in market rates 
in addition  the discussion does not take into account other types of risks which may be involved in the business operations of the company  such as the reinsurance recoveries on reinsurance treaties with third party insurers 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk 
since the company own approximately of the common stock of ilco  the interest rate risk of ilco s fixed income portfolio has an effect on the value of fic s investment in affiliate 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk a 
fic s fixed income investments the company manages the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities 
generally  we manage interest rate risk based on the application of a commonly used model 
the model projects the impact of interest rate changes on a range of factors  including duration and potential prepayment 
for example  assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in fair market value related to the financial instruments segment of the company s balance sheet is estimated to be million at december  and million at december  for purposes of the foregoing estimate  the following categories of the company s fixed income investments were taken into account i fixed maturities  including fixed maturities available for sale  ii short term investments and iii notes receivable from affiliates 
the market value of such assets was million at december  and million at december  the fixed income investments of the company include certain mortgage backed securities 
the market value of such securities was million at december  and million at december  assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in the fair market value related to such mortgage backed securities is estimated to be million at december  and million at december  separate account assets have not been included  since gains and losses on those assets generally accrue to the policyholders 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manager our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
b 
fic s investment in affiliate the value of fic s investment in affiliate is affected by the amount of unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  in the investment portfolio of its affiliate  ilco 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the net hypothetical loss in value  net of tax  related to the company s investment in affiliate is estimated to be million at december  and million at december  the hypothetical effect of the interest rate risk on fair values was estimated by applying a commonly used model 
the model projects the impact of interest rate changes on a range of factors  including duration and potential prepayment
