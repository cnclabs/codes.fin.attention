the estimated cost of the project is approximately million including software licensing  hardware  consulting and related expenses 
foreign operations 
to date there has been limited exposure to loss due to foreign currency risks in the company s asian subsidiaries  because the hong kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar at an official exchange rate of hk to us 
additionally  in recent years there have been no material fluctuations in the hong kong chinese exchange rates 
also  the company maintains the majority of its currency in asia in us dollar accounts 
however  there can be no assurance that these relationships will continue 
the company s operations  which are currently being transacted on a global basis  are exposed to variations in foreign exchange rates 
shareholders equity was reduced by a foreign currency translation adjustment of approximately million in and million in the changes in the exchange rates of the german and italian currencies against the american dollar  which were the principal causes of the foreign translation adjustments  had no material impact on the consolidated results of operations but such adjustments serve to reduce the company s tangible net worth 
if there are any material adverse changes in the relationships between the european and or canadian currencies with the united states dollar or if the hong kong or chinese currencies should no longer be tied to the us dollar  such changes could adversely affect the results of the company s european  canadian and or asian operations included in the consolidated financial statements and could cause further increases in the amount of foreign currency translation adjustments which are charged directly to shareholders equity
