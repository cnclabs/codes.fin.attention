item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this k report contains certain forward looking statements 
for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of  any statements using the terms believes  anticipates  expects  plans or similar expressions  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
there are a number of important factors that could cause varian semiconductor s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this report and presented by management from time to time 
some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause varian semiconductor s financial results to differ are under the heading risk factors below 
results of operations revenue recognition product revenue includes established products  new products and spare parts 
varian semiconductor recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
for some of varian semiconductor s sales transactions  a portion of the total purchase price is not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
for established products  the lesser of the amount allocated to the equipment or the contractual amount billable upon delivery is recorded as product revenue upon delivery 
the amount deferred is recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
for new products  revenue allocated to the equipment is recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized upon delivery 
varian semiconductor accrues warranty costs upon recognition of product revenue 
service revenue includes maintenance and service contracts  paid service and installation services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenue related to paid service is recorded when earned and the revenue related to installation is recorded upon fulfillment of the service obligation 
royalty revenue is recognized when contractual obligations are met  evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
varian semiconductor s transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon hourly rates at the estimated time to complete the service 
the fair value of all other elements are based upon the price charged when these amounts are sold separately and unaccompanied by other elements 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to undelivered elements based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to systems revenue 
installation is not essential to the functionality of the system  as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities 
change in revenue accounting principle in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes the staff s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues  including the timing of revenue recognition for sales that involve contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product if these events occur after shipment and transfer of title and risk of loss 
in october  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers sab faq 
the sab faq was issued to clarify many of the implementation questions surrounding sab varian semiconductor implemented the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal year varian semiconductor s previous revenue recognition policy was to recognize product revenue at the time the customer took title to the product  generally at the time of shipment 
at that time  varian semiconductor also accrued the costs to install the product 
for some transactions  a portion of the purchase price is not due until installation is complete and the product is accepted by the customer 
under sab and the new accounting method adopted retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal year  installation is considered a separate earnings process  revenue related to new products is recognized upon customer acceptance and revenue related to established products is accounted for as multiple element arrangements as described above 
as a result of this change  varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal year for fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized million in revenue which is included in the cumulative effect adjustment recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year the effect of that revenue was to increase income by million net of million of tax for fiscal year proforma amounts for the periods beginning before the first quarter of fiscal year have not been presented  as the effect of the change in accounting principle could not be reasonably determined 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes customer advances and amounts that have been billed per the contractual terms but have not been recognized as revenue 
change in inventory accounting principle during the first quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor changed its method of valuing domestic inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
prior to the spin off to shareholders on april   varian semiconductor had operated as a division of varian associates  inc  and had been required to conform to the parent company s lifo method of valuing domestic inventory 
varian semiconductor experienced declining materials costs and anticipated lower material unit costs in the foreseeable future through value engineering 
therefore  varian semiconductor believed the fifo method was preferable since it would more appropriately match revenues and expenses 
additionally  the adoption of the fifo method by varian semiconductor allows more readily comparable financial results with its principal competitors and other companies in the broader semiconductor industry segment that all use the fifo method 
varian semiconductor applied this change retroactively by restating the financial statements as required by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  which resulted in an increase to net income per diluted share for fiscal year of  an increase in retained earnings of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in deferred taxes of million at september  fiscal year varian semiconductor s fiscal year is the to week period that ends on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprises the week period ended on october  fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
revenue for the fiscal year ended september  was million  as compared to for fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
had sab not been adopted  a year over year comparison of revenue would have shown a decrease in revenue of million or 
the significant decrease in revenue was a result of the decline in demand for semiconductor devices beginning in the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
over the course of fiscal year  revenues decreased in each consecutive quarter  from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter  and to million in the fourth quarter 
the decline in revenue  year over year  is expected to continue into the next fiscal year 
total revenue was comprised of product revenue of million  service revenue of million  and royalty revenue of million 
both product and service revenue decreased from the prior fiscal year due to the downturn in the industry 
however  royalty revenue increased over the prior fiscal year despite the industry downturn primarily due to timing  as revenue recognized from royalties normally lags the sale of the product to the customer 
the industry decline was felt globally  as sales to both the asia pacific region and europe decreased from the prior year 
international revenues in fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in the asia pacific region were million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in europe were million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue was million and gross margin on product revenue was for the current fiscal year 
cost of service revenue was million and gross margin on service revenue was during the current fiscal year 
for comparative purposes  total gross margin for fiscal year of on a pre sab basis declined from fiscal year by 
the decrease in both cost of revenue and margin during the current fiscal year  as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily a result of the decrease in the volume of product shipments 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year were million  an increase of million or from fiscal year expenses of million 
research and development expenses were higher largely due to expansion of efforts in both product and services developments  reflected in the viista series products for mm applications  including the new high energy viista marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  a decrease of million or from fiscal year expenses of million 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased from the prior year mainly due to efforts to reduce spending in response to the industry downturn 
restructuring costs 
varian semiconductor recognized million in restructuring costs for fiscal year  of which 
million was recognized in the second quarter and million was recognized in the third quarter 
the restructuring charges primarily reflect the termination costs for a total reduction in force of employees approximately of worldwide employment 
the restructuring charges were done in connection with the cost reduction initiatives implemented during the fiscal year in response to the industry downturn 
interest income and other income  net 
interest income was million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase of million was primarily due to higher average cash balances  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million upon settlement of litigation 
after recording a payment to applied materials  and legal expenses  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount and the estimated accrual upon settlement of their patent infringement and antitrust litigation 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million upon receipt of a payment in settlement of a dispute relating to the acquisition of a product line which occurred in a prior fiscal year 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal years and the rate is lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax benefits arising from the use of a foreign sales corporation  the extraterritorial income exclusion and tax credits 
future tax rates may vary from the historic rates depending on the worldwide allocation of earnings and the continuing availability of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
varian semiconductor reported a change in accounting principle for the adoption of sab in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  by a cumulative effect adjustment 
varian semiconductor recorded a non cash charge of million after reduction for income taxes of million  or per diluted share  to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year the company recorded net income of million  compared with net income of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year as compared to per diluted share for fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue 
varian semiconductor s revenues of million in fiscal year increased by above the million in fiscal year due mainly to the increased demand for semiconductor devices that began in the second half of fiscal year product revenue and service revenue of million and million  both increased over the prior year amounts of million and million  respectively 
fourth quarter revenues in fiscal year included approximately million of non recurring royalty revenue primarily related to a licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
over the course of fiscal year  revenues increased steadily in each consecutive quarter  from million in the first quarter to million in the second quarter  to million in the third quarter  and to million in the fourth quarter 
royalty revenue for fiscal year was million compared with million in fiscal year  primarily due to the licensing agreement with tokyo electron ltd 
referenced above 
international revenues in fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in the asia pacific region were million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year sales to customers in europe were million and million in fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue was million or of product revenue  as compared to million or of product revenue for the prior fiscal year 
cost of service revenue was million or of service revenue  as compared to million or of service revenue for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in cost of revenue for the current fiscal year  as compared to the prior fiscal year  was due to the increase in revenue related to the upturn in the industry 
research and development 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased by from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year research and development expenses were higher largely due to expansion of efforts in both product and services developments  reflected in the introduction of the viista series products for mm applications  including the high energy viista research and development costs in fiscal year included incremental costs incurred pursuant to the discontinuance of a parallel product development research contract  following the acquisition of the high energy ion implantation equipment product line of genus 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million  were of total revenue in fiscal year  compared to million  or of total revenue in fiscal year marketing  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were higher as a percentage of revenue largely because of the additional administrative expenses in fiscal year associated with the transition to operating as an independent company 
restructuring costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized pre tax restructuring charges of million 
the charges included million resulting from the cancellation of plans for the expansion of manufacturing in the u 
s 
and japan  and million to cover termination costs for a reduction in workforce of employees approximately of varian semiconductor s worldwide employment 
there were no restructuring costs in fiscal year see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
settlement of litigation and arbitration 
in september  varian semiconductor and applied materials settled their patent infringement and antitrust litigation 
after recording a payment to applied materials and legal expenses  varian semiconductor recorded in other income  a gain of million million after taxes in the fourth quarter relating to this litigation settlement 
varian semiconductor maintains a provision to cover any residual indemnification obligations described above 
included in current liabilities and classified as an estimated loss contingency was million  as of september  during the second quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million  equivalent to million after tax or per diluted share resulting from payment to resolve a dispute relating to the acquisition of a product line which occurred in a prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year varian semiconductor settled with novellus  through arbitration  a dispute regarding the valuation of assets of tfs 
varian semiconductor recorded other income of million relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount of million and the estimated accrual 
interest income and other income  net 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recognized interest income of million compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million upon settlement of litigation 
after recording a payment to applied materials  and legal expenses  varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount and the estimated accrual upon settlement of their patent infringement and antitrust litigation 
in the second quarter of fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded a gain of million upon receipt of a payment in settlement of a dispute relating to the acquisition of a product line which occurred in a prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded other income of million relating to the difference between the actual settlement amount of a purchase price dispute relating to the sale of tfs and the estimated accrual 
provision for income taxes 
varian semiconductor s effective income tax rate was in fiscal year  compared to effective income tax benefit rate in fiscal year these rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax benefits arising from the use of a foreign sales corporation and tax credits and for fiscal year  unbenefited tax losses incurred prior to the spin off 
future tax rates may vary from the historical rates depending on the worldwide allocations of earnings and tax planning strategies 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  in fiscal year the company recorded net income of million compared with a net loss of million for fiscal year the net income per diluted share was for fiscal year as compared to a net loss of per diluted share for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources varian semiconductor generated million of cash from operations during fiscal year  as compared to million during fiscal year in fiscal year  cash provided by operations was primarily a result of decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million  in addition to net income of million  after adjusting for the non cash charge of million arising from a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the increases to cash during fiscal year were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million and deferred revenue of million 
cash provided by operations in fiscal year came primarily from net income of million  increases in accounts payable of million  and the tax benefit from exercise of stock options of million 
the increase in cash was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and million in inventories  due to the substantial increase in revenue 
during fiscal year  million of cash was used in investing activities  primarily for the purchase of property  plant  and equipment 
during fiscal year  varian semiconductor used million for investing activities  mainly for the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  offset by disposals and restricted cash received 
during fiscal year  million of cash was generated from financing activities  primarily as result of short term borrowings of million and million from the issuance of stock upon the exercise of stock options 
varian semiconductor generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal year  due to the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  varian semiconductor s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of varian semiconductor s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
varian semiconductor has not repurchased any stock to date 
varian semiconductor s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although varian semiconductor s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  varian semiconductor s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with available cash of million at september  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
fiscal restructuring 
during october  varian semiconductor implemented a reduction in force  primarily in the us  in which varian semiconductor s worldwide workforce was reduced by approximately employees or 
the reduction in force was in response to the downturn in the industry 
as a result  varian semiconductor will recognize approximately million in restructuring costs during the first quarter of fiscal year settlement and license agreement 
on december   varian semiconductor and lam research corporation lam resolved the patent infringement litigation between the two parties that was originally filed in october and varian semiconductor granted lam a license under certain patents 
additionally  all claims and counterclaims have been dismissed in accordance with the agreement 
the lawsuit involved varian semiconductor s assertion that lam infringed on three varian patents that relate to the use of low pressure gas to assist in the heating and cooling of semiconductor wafers during various manufacturing processes  and lam s denial that the patents are valid or infringed 
under the agreement  varian semiconductor has granted a license to lam under the patents in return for the payment of million with million paid immediately in exchange for prior use of the patents and the remaining million paid in quarterly installments through fiscal year in exchange for future use of the patents 
as further payment for past royalties  lam issued to varian semiconductor a warrant to purchase  shares of lam common stock for per share  exercisable at any time prior to december  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which will be effective for varian semiconductor in fiscal year sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
the revised standards include transition rules and requirements for identification  valuation and recognition of a much broader list of intangibles as part of business combinations than prior practice  most of which will continue to be amortized 
in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
varian semiconductor does not expect the adoption of the above mentioned pronouncements to have a material impact on varian semiconductor s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors varian semiconductor has a limited operating history as an independent company which may make it difficult to assess its financial performance and its ability to address the risks associated with its industry 
until april   varian associates  inc conducted varian semiconductor s business as one of its divisions 
as a result  varian semiconductor has only a limited operating history as an independent company on which its business and prospects can be evaluated 
varian semiconductor s ability to satisfy its obligations and maintain profitability will depend on its future performance  and varian semiconductor has limited experience in addressing various business challenges without the support of its corporate parent 
varian semiconductor will not be able to rely on the capital resources and cash flow of vai and will need to generate its own revenues and secure sources of financing when necessary 
in addition  varian semiconductor is a smaller and less diversified company than vai was prior to the spin off which may make varian semiconductor more susceptible to economic downturns in the semiconductor industry 
if varian semiconductor is unable to confront the challenges facing stand alone companies in its market  its business will suffer 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical  and a slowdown in demand for varian semiconductor s semiconductor manufacturing equipment will negatively impact its financial results 
the semiconductor industry has been cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
the industry is currently experiencing extreme volatility in product pricing and a slowdown in product demand 
volatility and slowdowns have resulted in significant reductions and delays in the purchase of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and the construction of new fabrication facilities which has significantly harmed varian semiconductor s financial results 
even though varian semiconductor s revenues are declining  in order to remain competitive  varian semiconductor continues to invest in research and development and to maintain its worldwide customer service and support capability 
these developments have adversely affected varian semiconductor s financial results and could continue to adversely affect financial results 
if the downturn in the semiconductor industry continues  the decrease in demand for varian semiconductor s products will continue to adversely affect its financial results 
varian semiconductor faces intense competition in the semiconductor equipment industry 
significant competitive factors in semiconductor equipment manufacturing include the strength of customer relationships  pricing  technological performance and timing  distribution capabilities and financial viability 
varian semiconductor believes that in order to remain competitive in this industry  it will need to devote significant financial resources to product and process research and development  to offering and marketing a broad range of products  and to maintaining and enhancing customer service and support centers worldwide 
the semiconductor equipment industry is becoming increasingly dominated by large manufacturers who have resources to support customers worldwide  and some of varian semiconductor s competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  service and support than varian semiconductor does 
with fewer resources  varian semiconductor may not be able to match the product offerings or customer service and technical support offered by its competitors 
in addition  some smaller equipment manufacturers provide innovative technology which may have performance advantages over varian semiconductor s systems 
if these manufacturers continue to improve their product performance and pricing or enter into strategic relationships with other large equipment manufacturers  sales of varian semiconductor s products may suffer 
varian semiconductor derives a substantial portion of its annual revenues from a small number of customers  and its business may be harmed by the loss of any one significant customer 
as described in item business  varian semiconductor has historically sold at least half of its systems in any particular period to its ten largest customers 
in addition  varian semiconductor may have difficulty attracting additional large customers because its sales depend  in large part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity in an existing fabrication facility or to transfer a manufacturing process to a new fabrication facility  both of which typically involve a significant capital commitment 
once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier s capital equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same supplier 
consequently  varian semiconductor may experience difficulty in selling to a prospective customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s capital equipment 
varian semiconductor s quarterly results of operations are likely to fluctuate  and as a result  varian semiconductor may fail to meet the expectations of its investors and securities analysts  which may cause the price of its common stock to decline 
varian semiconductor has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly financial results 
from time to time  customers may reschedule or cancel shipments  production difficulties could delay shipments  or techincal difficulties may delay installation of the product 
a delay in shipment or customer acceptance of the product upon installation in any quarter due to these factors may cause revenues in such quarters to fall significantly below expectations  which could cause the market price of varian semiconductor s common stock to decline 
varian semiconductor s financial results also fluctuate based on gross profits realized on sales 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue may vary based on a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of products sold and costs to manufacture upgrades and customize systems 
in addition  a number of other factors could impact varian semiconductor s quarterly financial results  including the following 
unexpected procurement or manufacturing difficulties  
pricing of key components  
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  
adverse weather conditions at its manufacturing facilities  and 
general conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry 
because varian semiconductor s operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels  and a high percentage of varian semiconductor s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single transaction could cause financial results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
varian semiconductor s future business depends  in part  on its ability to successfully introduce and manage the transition to new products  and varian semiconductor may not succeed in accomplishing these goals 
varian semiconductor believes that its future success will depend on its ability to develop  manufacture and successfully introduce new systems and product lines with improved capabilities and to continue enhancing existing products  in particular products that respond to the trend toward single wafer processing and mm wafer processing 
varian semiconductor derives virtually all of its revenue from sales and servicing of ion implantation systems and related products and services 
if varian semiconductor s viista ion implant platform  which relies on single wafer processing  does not gain market acceptance  future financial results will suffer 
varian semiconductor must accurately forecast the demand for new products while managing the transition from older products  or it may otherwise mismanage inventory levels 
in addition  varian semiconductor may be unable to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of new systems or enhancements or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and on time  which may harm its reputation and business 
in the past  varian semiconductor has experienced some delays in manufacturing and shipping systems and enhancements as well as problems with the reliability and quality of such systems and enhancements 
if any of varian s semiconductor s new products have reliability or quality problems  it may incur additional warranty and service expenses  experience a decline in product orders or incur higher manufacturing costs to correct such problems  all of which could adversely affect financial results 
economic problems in asian pacific markets could cause sales of varian semiconductor s products to decline 
international sales accounted for   and of varian semiconductor s revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  and specifically  sales to the asia pacific region have accounted for a substantial portion of these revenues 
sales to the asia pacific region accounted for   and of revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively 
because varian semiconductor relies on sales to customers in the asia pacific region for a substantial portion of its revenues  its business is very likely to be adversely impacted by economic downturns and instability in that region 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor s business was harmed by banking and currency problems in some asia pacific countries 
specifically  the decline in the value of the korean won  together with korean customers difficulties in obtaining credit resulted in a decline in the purchasing power of varian semiconductor s korean customers 
this resulted in the cancellation or delay of orders for varian semiconductor s products from korean customers which adversely affected financial results in fiscal year varian semiconductor recorded revenues of million to the asia pacific region during fiscal year the decrease from prior year was due mainly due a decline in demand for semiconductor devices 
in fiscal year  varian semiconductor recorded revenues of million in the asia pacific region  compared with million in fiscal year  due mainly to increased demand for semiconductor devices 
varian semiconductor s business in the asia pacific region is affected by demand in each country 
in fiscal year  japan s economy began slowly emerging from a downturn 
varian semiconductor has seen increasing order activity from japan throughout fiscal year however  if the japanese economy fails to sustain its recovery  investment by japanese customers may be negatively affected and it is possible that economic recovery in other asia pacific countries could be delayed 
if varian semiconductor is unable to protect its proprietary rights adequately  it may lose its ability to compete effectively in the semiconductor equipment industry 
varian semiconductor relies on obtaining and maintaining patent  copyright and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes and obtaining key licenses because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process to market 
varian semiconductor intends to continue to file applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes 
however  varian semiconductor cannot provide assurance of the following 
that patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by  or licensed to  varian semiconductor  
that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect varian semiconductor s technology position against competitors  
that any issued patents owned by or licensed to varian semiconductor will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and 
that the rights granted under varian semiconductor s patents will provide it with competitive advantages 
varian semiconductor also has agreements with third parties for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 
varian semiconductor s loss of licensing agreements with applied materials and tokyo electron limited could have a material adverse effect on its business 
in addition  varian semiconductor maintains and enforces its trademarks to increase customer recognition of its products 
if its trademarks are used by unauthorized third parties  its business may be harmed 
varian semiconductor also relies on contractual restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title  including confidentiality agreements with vendors  strategic partners  co developers  employees  consultants and other third parties to protect its proprietary rights 
if these contractual agreements are breached  varian semiconductor may not have adequate remedies for any such breaches 
varian semiconductor also cannot provide assurance that its trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by others 
patent claims may be expensive to pursue  defend or settle and may substantially divert varian semiconductor s resources and the attention of management 
varian semiconductor could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending patent suits brought against it or in asserting its patent rights against others 
if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to varian semiconductor  its business may be harmed 
varian semiconductor may not be aware of pending or issued patents held by third parties that relate to its products or technologies 
in the event that a claim is asserted against varian semiconductor  it may need to acquire a license to or contest the validity of a competitor s patent 
varian semiconductor cannot be certain that it could acquire such a license on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  or that it would prevail in such a proceeding 
from time to time  varian semiconductor has received notices from and has issued notices to such third parties alleging infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights relating to its products 
if varian semiconductor is subject to future claims of patent infringement  it may be required to make substantial settlement or damages payments and may have to devote substantial resources to reengineering its products 
it is difficult for varian semiconductor to predict the quarter in which it will be recognizing revenue from large product orders 
during a quarter  varian semiconductor customarily sells a relatively small number of ion implantation systems that typically sell for prices ranging from approximately million to million 
consequently  varian semiconductor s revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted for a particular quarter if anticipated orders from even a few customers are not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance of the installation during that quarter 
varian semiconductor recognizes all or a portion of the revenue from a product shipment at the time the product is installed and meets predetermined customer specifications 
as a result  it is often difficult to determine both the timing of a product shipment and the completion of the installation of the product at the customer s location 
in addition  varian semiconductor s product order backlog at the beginning of each quarter may not include all systems needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
because varian semiconductor may build systems according to forecast  the absence of a significant backlog for an extended period of time could adversely affect financial results 
varian semiconductor depends on limited groups of suppliers or single source suppliers  the loss of which could impair its ability to manufacture products and systems 
varian semiconductor obtains some of its components and subassemblies included in its products from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases a single source supplier  including magnets and high voltage power supplies and accelerators 
the loss of any supplier  including any single source supplier  would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers and may also require devoting significant resources to product development to incorporate new parts from other sources into its products 
the need to change suppliers or to alternate between suppliers might cause delays in delivery or significantly increase varian semiconductor s costs 
although varian semiconductor has limited insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources  varian semiconductor cannot provide assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that it will remain available on commercially acceptable terms 
although varian semiconductor seeks to reduce its dependence on these limited source suppliers  disruption or loss of these sources could negatively impact its business and damage customer relationships 
failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could subject varian semiconductor to penalties and environmental remediation costs 
varian semiconductor is subject to a variety of foreign  federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
these regulations include discharges into the soil  water and air and the generation  handling  storage and transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances 
these laws increase the costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of varian semiconductor s operations 
vai has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  at eight sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling or disposal 
vai is also in various stages of environmental investigation and or remediation under the direction of  or in consultation with foreign  federal  state and local agencies at certain current or former vai facilities including facilities disposed of in connection with vai s sale of its electron devices business during fiscal year  and the sale of its tfs business during fiscal year 
expenditures by vms as successor to vai for environmental investigation and remediation amounted to million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further investigation or remediation activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
vms has accrued million in estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs for these sites and facilites as of september  as to other sites and facilities  vms has gained sufficient knowledge to be able to better estimate the scope and costs of future environmental activities 
vms has accrued million  which represents its best estimate of the future costs discounted at  net of inflation  to cover these costs 
this reserve is in addition to the million previously described 
the distribution agreement provides that each of vms  varian semiconductor and ib will indemnify the others for one third of these environmental investigation and remediation costs  as adjusted for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits expected to be realized upon payment of these costs 
these accrued amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent may be greater than such estimates 
accordingly  varian semiconductor may need to make additional payments to cover its indemnification obligations that would exceed current estimates 
in addition  varian semiconductor s present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  such facilities have used substances which are or might be considered hazardous 
varian semiconductor also may have generated and disposed of wastes which are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that varian semiconductor cannot now predict 
if varian semiconductor loses key employees or is unable to attract and retain key employees  it may be unable to pursue business opportunities 
varian semiconductor s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of key managerial  technical and engineering personnel
