liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the net proceeds generated from the issuance of common stock  long term debt and certain short term borrowings that were subsequently converted into equity securities 
as of december   we have received net proceeds aggregating approximately million from these transactions 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million

net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  this represents the net loss for the year offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and increases in inventories partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  cash used for operations in that year was primarily related to funding expansion of research and development activities as well as the establishment of an administrative infrastructure 
cash used in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment was approximately million and million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash used in was primarily for the acquisition of manufacturing equipment and laboratory equipment used in research and development 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
in december  we entered into an agreement with an equipment lease financing company regarding a million facility secured by specific equipment 
each draw will be a separate loan under the facility 
we drew the remaining amount in early secured by manufacturing equipment for cartridge assembly that we had previously purchased 
approximately million of this facility was drawn by december and was secured by our existing equipment 
each equipment loan has a month term and bears an interest rate of approximately per annum adjusted for an index rate based on four year us treasury notes at the time of borrowing 
in addition  we entered into an agreement for bridge financing with sr one  limited in december under this agreement  million was funded in december and million was funded in january in june  sr one  limited agreed to convert million of the million loan  together with accrued interest at the rate of on million  into shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
the conversion price was  which was of the initial public offering price per unit 
sr one received  shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
each share of series a convertible preferred stock was in turn converted on july   at the option of the holder  into one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase an additional share of our common stock 
all accrued and unpaid dividends with respect to shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted by sr one were also converted into units at the initial public offering price per unit 
the exercise price and other terms of the warrant received on the conversion were the same as the warrants included in units sold in the offering 
the remaining million of the loan matures in june at that time  we expect either to repay the million balance on the bridge financing with the proceeds of a new loan or to negotiate to extend the term or convert the balance of it into preferred or common equity 
the annual interest rate on the remaining million increased to on july  s 
r 
one has the option to convert all or any portion of the remaining loan  plus accrued interest thereon  into shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
this series a convertible preferred stock would be issued to sr one on the same basis as the series a convertible preferred stock that was issued to s 
r 
one in connection with the million conversion discussed above 
we issued a bridge warrant to sr one  limited in connection with the bridge financing 
the bridge warrant was exercisable for the number of shares of common stock equal to  divided by of the initial public offering price of the common stock 
the number of warrants doubled if the loan was not repaid by june  as part of the conversion of a portion of the bridge financing into shares of series a convertible preferred stock  the bridge warrant was modified such that it will be exercisable in all events for the number of shares of common stock which is equal to  divided by  which is of the initial public offering price per unit 
upon completion of our initial public offering  the bridge warrant became exercisable for  shares of common stock 
the bridge warrant has an exercise price of 
the bridge warrant was exercisable at december  and will expire on june  in march  we sold  shares of common stock in a private placement for per share 
proceeds  net of approximately  of offering costs  amounted to approximately million 
these shares were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission in april as part of this transaction  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued to the placement agent and contingent warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were issued 
during the third quarter  the conditions triggering exercisability of these warrants were met 
a total of  of these warrants were exercised prior to their expiration on december  in september  we raised an additional  of net proceeds in a private placement of shares of series b convertible preferred stock and  warrants to purchase common stock 
that financing included the placement of a warrant to purchase an additional  of series b convertible preferred stock which was exercised in november it also included the placement of callable two year warrants exercisable for up to  shares of common stock  subject to conditions  in multiples of twenty shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we can call the common stock warrants at any time 
they may be exercised within two days of the date of call at a price equal to of the average trading price over the two days prior to the date of the call 
the series b convertible preferred stock is convertible into our common stock at of an average of the ten lowest trading prices during the thirty days before the date of conversion 
pursuant to section of the american stock exchange company guide  we may at present only issue up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock upon conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock and exercise of the callable two year warrants to purchase common stock issued in connection with the purchase of our series b convertible preferred stock without shareholder approval 
at our annual meeting  we plan to seek our shareholders approval of the issuance of the additional shares of common stock in excess of  shares that may be issued in connection with the conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock and the exercise of the callable two year warrants to purchase common stock issued in connection with the purchase of our series b convertible preferred stock 
in a series of related transactions in november  december and january  the company raised  of net proceeds in a private placement of  shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase common stock 
at december   our current liquidity and sales revenue expected after are projected to be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least months 
the company is currently working with an investment bank to arrange an equity financing transaction 
to the extent that we need additional funds in connection with generating our commercial product sales  we expect to borrow funds to build sufficient cartridge inventory to meet the needs that would result from anticipated sales 
we also expect that the development of additional tests will require research expenditures at a level lower than past spending for test development 
sales and marketing activities will require hiring and training additional staff in this estimate of the period for which we expect our available sources of cash to be sufficient to meet our funding needs is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our capital requirements for this period as a result of certain factors set forth under risk factors additional funding may not be available and elsewhere in our registration statement on form s on file with the sec dated september  in the event our capital requirements are greater than estimated  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development activities  to scale up manufacturing activities and to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock  the timing of regulatory actions regarding our products  the costs and timing of expansions of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  procurement and enforcement of patents important to our business  and the impact of competitors products 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be forced to curtail our operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into collaborative agreements or other arrangements on unfavorable terms 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern 
income taxes as of december   we had approximately million and  of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards  respectively  for federal income tax purposes  which begin to expire in these amounts reflect different treatment of expenses for tax reporting than are used for financial reporting 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year 
we experienced a change in ownership interest in excess of as defined under the tax reform act upon the first closing of our equity financing and by means of the private placements in we do not believe that these changes in ownership will have any significant impact on our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
there can be no assurance that ownership changes in future periods will not significantly limit our use of existing or future net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
