item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we offer advanced design and manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers  commonly referred to as oems 
we specialize in custom display modules utilizing liquid crystal display  or lcd  components and technology 
our lcd modules have varying levels of integration 
at a minimum  each module includes an lcd  a custom lcd driver  and a flexible connector 
we also provide value added services  which increase our competitiveness  by assembling additional components onto the module based upon the specific needs of the customer 
these additional components include such items as keypads  microphones  speakers  light guides  and optics 
we currently sell substantially all of our lcd modules to major oems 
we derived more than of our net sales in and from the mobile handset market 
when we win a design program  our customer typically pays all or a portion of our nonrecurring engineering expenses to defray the costs of custom design  as well as the costs of nonrecurring tooling for custom components 
the typical design program life cycle of a custom designed lcd module is three to twelve months and includes technical design  prototyping  pilot manufacturing  and high volume manufacturing 
we typically seek large volume programs from major oems 
the minimum production quantity for an lcd module typically approximates  units per year  although the production rate for some programs has been as high as  units per week 
the selling price of our lcd modules usually ranges between and per unit 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
generally  all of these conditions are met at the time we ship products to customers 
we experienced substantial growth from through  primarily as a result of sales to oems in the wireless communications industry  which grew substantially during that period 
during that period  our primary customer was motorola 
in  our net sales declined  primarily as a result of the phase out by motorola of a significant family of programs 
in  our net sales returned to pre levels primarily as a result of several new programs and customers 
motorola accounted for of our net sales in  in  in  and in during the past several years  we have experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in our net sales as our oem customers developed retail products with shorter product life cycles and phased out older programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  sales usually peak in the fourth quarter of a calendar year and are lower in the following quarter 
this pattern did not occur in as a result of supply interruptions in the fourth quarter and reduced expectations in the mobile handset market 
several factors impact our gross margins  including manufacturing efficiencies  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
currently  significant pricing pressure exists in the lcd module market  especially in higher volume programs in the wireless communications industry 
accordingly  as the production levels of some of our new higher volume programs have increased  the lower standard gross margins on those programs have impacted  and will continue to impact  our overall margins 
we vertically integrate our manufacturing facilities 
in arizona  we own and operate the largest high volume lcd production line in north america 
we generally use the arizona facility for the manufacture of more technologically complex and custom high volume lcds 
we also purchase lcds from asian and european sources to provide us an alternate source and to ensure available capacity 
in order to take advantage of lower labor costs  we ship our lcds to our facilities in manila  the philippines  or beijing  china  for assembly into modules 
in manila  we assemble lcds into modules and perform certain back end lcd processing operations 
we conduct our operations in manila through a third party subcontract manufacturer 
the subcontractor supplies direct labor and incidental services required to manufacture our products 
all indirect manufacturing employees  primarily technicians  supervisors  and engineers  are our employees 
in july  we exercised our right to terminate the subcontract agreement with the third party subcontractor  but are negotiating to have in place a new sub assembly agreement for that factory by the end of the first quarter of in may  we signed a lease for a build to suit factory in manila 
the term of the lease for this second factory in manila is months starting upon the completion of the factory  expected to be by the end of the first quarter of at this second factory  we will be employing our own employees and will not be employing the services of the third party subcontractor 
in  we opened a temporary manufacturing facility in beijing and commenced construction of a permanent beijing facility 
the permanent facility was substantially completed in early july  and we began production in that new manufacturing facility late in the third quarter of all production in beijing beginning in the fourth quarter of was conducted at our new permanent facility 
we own our beijing facility through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
we employ our own employees in beijing and do not employ the services of a third party subcontractor 
selling  general  and administrative expense consists principally of administrative and selling costs  salaries  commissions  and benefits to personnel and related facility costs 
we make substantially all of our sales directly to oems  and our sales force consists of a small number of direct technical sales persons 
as a result  there is no material cost of distribution in our selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense has increased as we have expanded our business and increased our diversification efforts 
in addition  we have recently incurred substantial marketing and administrative expenses in connection with our lcos microdisplay business 
research  development  and engineering expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  design engineers  and other technical personnel  related facility costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research  development  and engineering expense continues to increase as we develop new display products and technologies  especially lcos microdisplays  while we continue with our in house process development efforts related to the high volume lcd manufacturing line located in arizona 
since  we have been working on the development of lcos microdisplays 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with national semiconductor corporation for the development of lcos microdisplay products 
under that alliance  national focused on the silicon technologies needed for microdisplays  and we focused on the liquid crystal technologies 
in  national decided to close its microdisplay business unit 
in connection with that closing  in july  we purchased certain assets and licensed silicon technologies from national relating to lcos microdisplays 
we paid approximately million in cash and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock in the transaction  which valued the transaction at approximately million 
no additional payments are required under the licenses 
we also hired several key technical employees of national to assist in the implementation of the acquired technologies 
in april  we entered into a strategic relationship with inviso  inc  formerly siliscape  inc  a privately held company with numerous patents and proprietary technology related to microdisplay development 
we acquired a minority equity interest in inviso for approximately million 
in march  we acquired an additional interest in inviso for  raising our total minority equity interest to million 
as part of this strategic relationship  we provide proprietary manufacturing capabilities and liquid crystal expertise  and inviso provides patented and proprietary technologies and components for the joint development of microdisplay products 
in august  we licensed the microdisplay technology of s vision corporation  which had recently ceased operations 
this license is an irrevocable  royalty free  fully paid up  worldwide license to manufacture and package certain microdisplay products and patented optical engines 
in october  we entered into an agreement with tecdis spa  a european based lcd company  to form an asic design center in chatillon  italy 
the asic design center will be known as dora and will focus on the design of asics necessary to drive the lcds we and tecdis design for our respective customers 
stmicroelectronics is also participating in dora and has agreed to manufacture the asics designed by dora 
in august  our wholly owned subsidiary  three five systems beijing co  ltd  entered into a strategic agreement with heibei jiya electronics  co  ltd 
jiya  a chinese based manufacturer of lcd glass 
under the terms of the agreement  jiya will provide lcd glass to us and reserve a significant amount of lcd glass manufacturing capacity for us 
in exchange  we will assist jiya in further developing its lcd glass manufacturing processes 
at the conclusion of months  we have the option to extend the agreement or to acquire a majority interest in jiya 
these acquisitions  investments  and licenses will result in increased research  development  and engineering expense as we expand our lcos microdisplay development efforts in preparation for the commercial introduction of lcos microdisplay products 
we are also considering licensing other technologies from other companies that could be optimized on our lcd manufacturing line as well as entering into further alliances 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  especially on our lcos microdisplay technology and related products 
as a result  the actual dollar amount of our research  development  and engineering expense will continue to increase 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated financial statements 
years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in this increase was the result of several new programs  primarily for motorola 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in from in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from increased operating efficiencies in the first half of and cost reduction efforts 
pricing pressures and under absorption issues resulting from decreased production levels in the second half of actually resulted in a sharp increase in the cost of sales in the second half of  especially in the fourth quarter 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to in the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expense was a result of our efforts to hold down costs 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in compared to in in general  research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the development of new display products and technologies  including lcos microdisplays 
expenses also increased in lcd engineering as a result of the increased number of design wins 
the selling  general and administrative expense and the research  development and engineering expense in each year included significant operating expenditures in lcos microdisplays at a time when there was very little lcos microdisplay revenue 
in  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses specifically related to lcos microdisplays compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other income in was million compared to other expense of  in we had sharply higher interest income and reduced interest expense in as the result of decreased debt and increased cash and investment balances 
those increased cash and investment balances were primarily as a result of our equity offering in may provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to in this change resulted primarily from tax benefits in the third and fourth quarters of relating to research and development tax credits 
generally  the tax rate was also lower in as a result of higher net income in china which is a low tax rate jurisdiction 
in  we expect our overall tax rate to be approximately 
net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in excluding lcos microdisplay related expenses  our net income was approximately million  or per diluted share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in this increase resulted from several new programs  primarily for motorola 
net sales in the fourth quarter of were greater than net sales in the first quarter of cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in from in this percentage decrease resulted primarily from increased operating efficiencies as a result of a significant increase in production volume 
most of those operating efficiencies occurred in the fourth quarter of in addition  our permanent china manufacturing facility was operational during the entire fourth quarter  and in that new facility we experienced better yields and absorption than when we operated in our temporary china facility 
selling  general  and administrative expense 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expense was of net sales in compared to in the increase in selling  general  and administrative expense reflected the continued expansion of our business  especially in lcos microdisplays 
research  development  and engineering expense 
research  development  and engineering expense increased to million in from million in research  development  and engineering expense was of net sales in compared to in although research  development  and engineering expense associated with in process developments on the lcd line decreased in  research  development  and engineering expense overall increased as the result of the development of new display products and technologies  including lcos microdisplays 
the selling  general and administrative expense and the research  development and engineering expenses in each year included operating expenses in lcos microdisplays at a time when there was very little microdisplay revenue 
in  we incurred approximately million of operating expenses specifically related to lcos microdisplays compared to approximately million in other income expense  net 
other expense was  in compared to  in we had sharply higher interest income in the fourth quarter of as a result of increased cash balances and a tax refund 
that interest income offset interest expense we had in the first three quarters of as a result of additional borrowing incurred in connection with our stock repurchase program and increased borrowings on our working capital line of credit 
all credit lines were paid off and cash balances increased as a result of our equity offering in the third quarter of provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to million in this change resulted primarily from higher pre tax income in compared to the same period in in addition  we recorded tax benefits in the first and fourth quarters of relating to a state income tax refund 
generally  the tax rate was also lower in as a result of higher net income in china which is a low tax rate jurisdiction compared to a net loss in china in net income 
net income increased to million  or per diluted share  in from million  or per diluted share  in excluding lcos microdisplay related expenses  our net income for was approximately million  or per diluted share 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of net sales

net sales cost and expenses cost of sales selling  general  and administrative research  development  and engineering operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss historically  we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our net sales 
oem customers that purchase our products for incorporation into retail products  such as mobile handsets  typically increase their purchases during the year end holiday period and phase out old programs early in the year following holiday sales 
as a result  net sales typically peak in the fourth quarter and reach a seasonal low point in the first quarter 
this pattern did not occur in as a result of supply interruptions in the fourth quarter and reduced expectations in the mobile handset market 
there is significant pricing pressure in higher volume programs in the wireless communications and office automation industries 
in the first quarter of  we had an unfavorable product mix  shipping principally lower margin products 
in addition  reduced manufacturing yields and under absorption of fixed overhead contributed to lower margins 
in the second half of  higher volumes in our manufacturing facilities produced increased operating efficiencies  resulting in better margins 
in addition  we moved into our permanent facility in china in the third quarter of and  as a result  operating efficiencies increased in china in the fourth quarter of the higher gross margins continued into the first half of as a result of continued efficiencies 
as revenue declined in the second half of  absorption issues from the reduced manufacturing levels resulted in lowered margins 
in addition  pricing pressures in the mobile handset business also contributed to the reduced gross margins 
in  we continued to expand and intensify our research and development efforts on proprietary display products  such as lcos microdisplays 
other expense increased in the first half of as our cash balances declined and we increased our borrowings 
all borrowings were paid off and cash balances increased as a result of our equity offering in the third quarter of as a result  we had sharply higher interest income in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we had another equity offering  which further raised our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and increased our interest income in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  in  we had million in net cash flow from operations compared to million from operations in cash flow from operations during was lower than primarily as a result of increased inventories 
inventories were lower than normal at the end of because of material component shortages 
in addition  an increased backlog at the end of resulted in higher inventory balances 
as of december   our inventory turns were and dsos day sales outstanding were days 
our depreciation expense was million in compared to million in our working capital was million at december   up from million at december  our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  the increase in our working capital and current ratio occurred primarily because of our equity offering in the second quarter of  in which we sold approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million 
in january  we entered into a credit facility with imperial bank 
that credit facility was a million unsecured revolving line of credit that matured in january mellon bank was a participating lender on that credit facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under that credit facility on december  in january  we amended and revised that facility to reduce it to million and eliminated mellon bank as a participating lender 
advances under the new facility may be made as prime rate advances  which accrue interest payable monthly at the bank s prime lending rate  or as libor rate advances  which bear interest at basis points in excess of the libor base rate 
our united kingdom three five systems limited subsidiary has established an annually renewable credit facility with a united kingdom bank in order to fund its working capital requirements 
the credit facility  which expires january   provides  of borrowing capacity secured by accounts receivable of three five systems limited 
no borrowings are outstanding under this facility 
as of december   our beijing subsidiary had an outstanding million term loan due may  to the bank of china  which was secured by a million stand by letter of credit issued by imperial bank 
capital expenditures during were approximately million 
those capital expenditures consisted of million for equipment and leasehold improvement costs in manila  beijing and arizona  and million for lcos microdisplays 
we also made an additional investment in inviso of  capital expenditures during were approximately million 
these capital expenditures consisted of million for equipment and construction costs relating to our manufacturing facility in beijing  million for manufacturing and office equipment for our operations in manila and arizona  and million for lcos microdisplays  including our purchase of assets and licenses from national semiconductor and s vision 
the assets and licensed silicon technologies from national semiconductor relating to lcos microdisplays were acquired for approximately million in cash and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to depreciable assets  tooling and mask rights  and amortizable licenses 
we believe that our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  investments  anticipated cash flows from operations and available and anticipated credit lines will provide adequate sources to fund our operations and planned expenditures through we may have to expand our loan commitments or pursue alternate methods of financing or raise capital  however  should we encounter additional cash requirements 
for example  accounts receivable and inventory could rise faster than anticipated if revenue levels increase more than currently anticipated 
in addition  we will continue to seek other alliances or acquisitions and additional relationships with regard to the strategic development of various new technologies  especially lcos microdisplays  that may also require us to make additional capital investments 
we cannot provide assurance that adequate additional loan commitments or alternative methods of financing will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms acceptable to us 
impact of recently issued standards 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instrument s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  to the extent effective  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
cannot be applied retroactively 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
on january  in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which addresses certain criteria for revenue recognition 
sab  as amended by sab a and sab b  outlines the criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
we have implemented the applicable provisions of sab the impact of adopting the provisions of sab was not material to the accompanying financial statements 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
when adopted  eitf no 
requires that all amounts billed to customers in sale transactions related to shipping and handling be classified as revenue

during march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin  which  among other issues  addresses repricing and other modifications made to previously issued stock options 
we adopted fin during july the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments at december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
we hold no investment securities that would require disclosure of market risk 
we have certain receivables denominated in chinese renminbi 
to eliminate our exposure to changes in the us dollar chinese renminbi exchange rate  we have entered into forward contracts to protect future cash flows 
hedge accounting under current accounting principles generally accepted in the united states does not require us to record any gain or loss on the forward contracts until settled 
in contrast  under sfas no 
 we will designate the forward contracts as cash flow hedges 
we will account for changes in the fair value of our forward contracts  based on changes in the forward exchange rate  with all changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings upon settlement of the forward contract at an amount that will offset the related transaction gain or loss arising from the remeasurement and adjust earnings for the cost of the forward contracts 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have a revolving line of credit with a variable interest rate of libor at december  plus basis points 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
we generally sell our products and services and negotiate purchase orders with our foreign suppliers in us dollars 
however  we have certain foreign currency exchange exposure as a result of our manufacturing operations in the philippines and china and our sales and distribution facility in the united kingdom 
the third party subcontractor agreement relating to our operations in manila is based on a fixed conversion rate  exposing us to exchange rate fluctuations with the philippine peso 
we have not incurred any material exchange gains or losses to date 
some of the expenses of these foreign operations are denominated in the philippine peso  chinese renminbi  and british pound sterling  respectively 
these expenses include local salaries and wages  utilities  and some operating supplies 
as a result of these sales and expenses  we do have accounts receivable and cash deposits in local currencies 
we believe  however  that the operating expenses currently incurred in foreign currencies other than the chinese renminbi are immaterial  and therefore any associated market risk is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
although the chinese currency currently is stable  its value in relation to the us dollar is determined by the chinese government 
there is general speculation that china may devalue its currency 
devaluation of the chinese currency could result in translation adjustments to our balance sheet as well as reportable losses depending on our monetary balances and outstanding indebtedness at the time of devaluation 
the government of china historically has made it difficult to convert its local currency into foreign currencies 
although we from time to time may enter into hedging transactions in order to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations  the chinese currency is not freely traded and thus is difficult to hedge 
in addition  the government of china has recently imposed restrictions on chinese currency loans to foreign operated entities in china 
based on the foregoing  we cannot provide assurance that fluctuations and currency exchange rates in the future will not have an adverse effect on our operations
