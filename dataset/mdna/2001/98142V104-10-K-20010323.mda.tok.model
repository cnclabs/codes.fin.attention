for  the company had an operating loss of million and a loss before extraordinary item of million 
the company s net loss after extraordinary gains on the extinguishment of debt of million was million 
for the company had operating income of million and a loss of million before the million cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
for after the cumulative effect of the accounting change  the company had net income of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the third quarter ended september   the company changed its method of accounting for certain aircraft maintenance costs from the accrual method of accounting to the direct expense method 
under the new accounting method  maintenance costs are recognized as expense as maintenance services are performed and as flight hours are flown for nonrefundable maintenance payments required by lease agreements 
the company believes that the new accounting principle is preferable because the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry and there has not been an obligating event prior to the maintenance checks actually being performed or flight hours being flown 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was million 
total block hours decreased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft increased to hours in from hours in in  the company obtained a higher percentage of its revenues under full service contracts than in in  full service contracts accounted for of total block hours and of total revenues  compared to and  respectively  in operating revenues 
although operating revenues were the same each year at million  revenue per block hour flown increased to  in from  in also  in the company received approximately million in revenue associated with minimum guarantee payments from mas 
no similar payments were received in operating expenses 
total operating expenses decreased to million in from million in total operating expenses for were reduced by a million contract dispute settlement received from a former customer 
flight expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than maintenance  aircraft rent  and fuel 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from increases in flight attendant costs and passenger food costs due to more full service flying 
maintenance expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted from a number of reasons including the change in accounting  the reduction in block hours flown and a decrease in the average number of aircraft from to if the new method of accounting that was adopted effective january  had been implemented for  maintenance expenses for would have been million lower 
the company also recorded a credit of million for engine parts that were recovered in the fourth quarter of these parts are included in equipment and property at december  aircraft costs decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects reductions in the lease rates for the fleet of md aircraft and the return of two dc aircraft in the second quarter of fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase reflects the increase in full service block hours flown together with an increase in average fuel prices per gallon to in from in the company is generally able to pass fuel cost increases through to its customers 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease resulting from the sale and leaseback of an engine in the first quarter of and the ending of amortization of an intangible asset in sales  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects the effect of cost control measures the company has implemented in personnel costs in recent years 
interest expense decreased million in to million from in this decrease resulted from reductions in the average amount of debt outstanding 
other non operating income in includes gains of approximately million on the sale of the company s interest in an unaffiliated communications company 
there were no comparable gains in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total block hours decreased  hours  or  to  hours in from  hours in  with an average of available aircraft per day in compared to in average daily utilization block hours flown per day per aircraft increased to hours in from hours in in  the company continued to obtain a higher percentage of its revenues under wet lease contracts as opposed to full service contracts 
in  full service contracts accounted for of total block hours compared with in operating revenues 
operating revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in block hours flown  partially offset by a shift in business from acmi flying to full service flying 
also  in the company received approximately million in revenue associated with minimum guarantee payments from mas versus approximately million in operating expenses 
total operating expenses were flat year over year  million in compared to million in flight expenses include all expenses related directly to the operation of the aircraft other than maintenance  aircraft rent  and fuel 
also included are expenses related to flight dispatch and flight operations administration 
flight expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from increases in flight attendant costs and passenger food due to the shift to more full service flying 
maintenance expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the average number of aircraft from to and the reduction in hours flown 
this was partially offset by the normal increase in maintenance costs generally experienced with aging aircraft 
in addition  the company experienced an increase in costs associated with the md aircraft and related engines as a result of certain manufacturer guarantees and warranties that expired in and maintenance costs that increased pursuant to contractual agreements 
aircraft costs decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects reductions in the lease rates for the fleet of md aircraft and the return of two dc aircraft in the second quarter of fuel expenses increased million  or  in to million from million in this increase reflects the increase in full service block hours flown partially offset by a decrease in average fuel prices from in to in the company is generally able to pass fuel cost increases through to its customers 
commissions decreased million in to million from million in this decrease resulted from the end of a philippine airlines contract in february and reduced expenses incurred in connection with reduced revenues relating to a decrease in amc flying 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in both the depreciation of dc leasehold improvements and amortization of other assets  partially offset by an increase in the depreciation of owned engines 
sales  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in to million from million in this decrease principally reflects a million decrease in general insurance costs 
interest expense decreased million in to million from in this decrease resulted from reductions in the average amount of debt outstanding 
other non operating income includes gains of approximately million on the sale of the company s interest in an unaffiliated communications company 
there were no comparable gains in extraordinary gain 
in  the company acquired million of its outstanding debentures for cash and treasury stock at a discount of approximately resulting in extraordinary gains of million 
liquidity and capital resources world airways cash and short term investments at december  totaled million 
as is common in the airline industry  the company operates with a working capital deficit 
at december   world airways current assets were million and current liabilities were million 
world airways is highly leveraged 
as of december   the company had outstanding long term debt and capital leases of million  and notes payable and current maturities of long term obligations of million 
in addition  the company has significant long term obligations relating to operating leases for aircraft 
the company has historically financed working capital and capital expenditure requirements out of cash flow from operating activities  sales of common stock  secured borrowings  and other financings 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have important consequences including i world airways ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be limited  ii a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  iii world airways degree of leverage and related debt service obligations  as well as its obligations under operating leases  may make it more vulnerable than some of its competitors in a prolonged economic downturn  and iv world airways financial position may restrict its ability to pursue new business opportunities and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business conditions 
although there can be no assurances  world airways believes that the combination of its existing contracts and additional business which it expects to obtain  along with its existing cash  and financing arrangements  will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its cash requirements related to operating and capital requirements for also  in february  the company implemented an month salary exchange program for most of its employees 
under the program  participating employees are exchanging up to of wages for common stock on the basis of one share of stock for each of wages exchanged 
the exchange rate was determined from average stock prices coinciding to when the board of directors approved the program 
it is expected the program will produce total cash savings of approximately million during the month program and result in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
approximately million shares were issued as restricted shares following the beginning of the program 
employees are able to vote the restricted shares but are not able to sell the shares until the end of the program 
expense associated with the value of the shares is being recognized over the month period 
if an employee leaves the company during the program  a pro rata portion of the shares are returned to the company 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to providing million in the decrease in cash in resulted from the reduced loss from continuing operations in that was partially offset by increases in accounts receivables  prepaid expenses and aircraft lease deposits 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december   compared to million in in  million of cash was used primarily for the purchase of aircraft parts and million was generated by the maturing of marketable securities 
in  million of cash was used for the acquisition of aircraft parts and million was used to purchase marketable securities 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities generated million in cash for the year ended december  compared to using million in in  million of cash was generated through increased borrowings  million was generated through the sale leaseback transaction of an engine and million was used for the repayment of debt 
in  cash was principally used for the repayment of debt 
capital commitments financing developments the faa has issued and proposed a number of airworthiness directives ad s that will require the company to make modifications to its aircraft 
one ad requires the replacement of insulation blankets on the company s md aircraft by june that is expected to cost less than million per aircraft 
one proposed ad would require the modification of thrust reversers on the company s dc aircraft by february that is estimated to cost approximately million per aircraft 
see regulatory matters in item the company expects to finance the cost of the ad s through internally generated funds 
world airways capital expenditures for other than the cost of ad s are currently expected to be approximately million  principally for the purchase of aircraft related assets  which it expects to finance from working capital 
at december   the company has placed deposits for four dc f freighter aircraft that it is scheduled to take delivery of in two of the aircraft will be leased under three year operating leases and two under seven year operating leases 
in the event that world airways leases additional aircraft  particularly if they are of a different type than currently operated  the company may have to make expenditures for deposits and additional spare engines and parts 
no assurances can be given  however  that the company will obtain all of the financing required for such capital expenditures 
the company is scheduled to relocate its corporate headquarters from virginia to peachtree city  near atlanta  georgia in it is expected the move  which is planned to be completed in the second quarter  will be financed from internally generated funds 
in connection therewith the company signed a year lease for the facility beginning may  in  in conjunction with leasing two md er aircraft the company agreed to assume leases of one or two md f freighter aircraft for the remainder of their year leases that commenced in november and december  in the event that the existing lessee terminates its lease with the lessor 
as of the date hereof  the company does not know if the existing lessee intends to terminate the existing lease or not 
as part of the agreement for the aircraft  the lessor provided spare parts financing of which approximately million is still available 
other matters inflation the company believes that neither inflation nor changing prices have had a material effect on the company s revenues during the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk world airways does not have any material exposure to market risks 
with respect to interest rate risks  at december  interest rates on all of the company s long term debt and capitalized lease obligations aggregating million are fixed 
borrowings under the company s credit agreement  million at december   bear interest at prime plus 
based on the average outstanding month end balances during each change in the prime rate would have increased or decreased the company s interest cost by approximately  based on the balance outstanding at december  each change in the prime rate will increase or decrease the company s interest cost by approximately  on an annual basis 
see notes and of notes to financial statements in item the company has not entered into any obligations for trading purposes 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rate risks  although a significant percentage of the company s revenues are derived from foreign customers  all revenues and substantially all expenses are denominated in us dollars 
the company maintains minimal balances in foreign bank accounts to facilitate the payment of expenses 
see note of notes to financial statements in item the company is not exposed to commodity price risks except with respect to the purchase of aviation fuel 
however  fluctuations in the price of fuel have not had a significant impact on the company s operations in recent years because  in general  the company s contracts with its customers limit the company s exposure to increases in fuel prices 
the company purchases no fuel under long term contracts nor does the company enter into futures or swap contracts
