ebitda our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants 
many of these covenants are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  lifo charge  extraordinary loss  and one time items ebitda 
the ability to generate ebitda at levels sufficient to satisfy the requirements of these agreements is a key measure of our financial strength 
we do not intend to present ebitda as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
rather  presentation of ebitda is based on the definition contained in our bank credit facility 
this may be a different definition than other companies use 
we were in compliance with all ebitda based bank credit facility and indenture covenants on february  ebitda for increased to  million from  million in ebitda for increased from  million in these ebitda increases were primarily due to economies of scale resulting from increased sales  efficiencies described in gross profit above  returns from capital investments  and returns from recent acquisitions

total merger related costs were million in  million in and million in in addition to merger related costs that are shown separately on the statement of income  we also incurred other one time expenses that are included in merchandise costs and operating  general and administrative expenses 
the one time expenses incurred during and were costs related to recent mergers 
the one time expenses were costs incurred associated with logistics projects and operations consolidation in texas 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for and beyond 
this impairment review occurred during the first quarter of during this review we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of  assets to be held and used  and certain investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased

liquidity and capital resources cash flows information cash flow from operations was  million in compared to  million in and  million in the increase in was due to an increase in earnings and our efforts to reduce net operating working capital and improve cash flow 
the decrease in cash provided by operations during was due to an increase in inventory levels at the end of fiscal year as a result of the effect of yk 
cash flows used by investing activities was  million in compared to  million in and  million in the decrease in and increase in were primarily related to our storing activity and asset acquisitions 
during   and we had capital expenditures excluding acquisitions of  million   million  and  million  respectively 
we spent million for acquisitions during compared to million in and million in we opened  acquired  expanded  or relocated food stores in  food stores in  and food stores in during those same periods  we remodeled   and food stores  respectively 
cash used by financing activities was million in compared to cash provided of million in and a use of million in the decrease in cash during was due to a decrease in the amount borrowed and an increase in the treasury shares purchased during the increase in cash in was due to fewer debt prepayment costs in compared to and a decrease in the financing charges incurred during the debt prepayment costs in related primarily to debt refinancing as a result of mergers at fred meyer  inc debt management we have several lines of credit totaling approximately billion with billion of unused balances at february  in addition  we have a million synthetic lease credit facility with no unused balance and million in money market lines with an unused balance of million at february  total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases  decreased million to billion in and increased million to billion in both the decrease in and the increase in were due to business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense 
we also prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end  and million at year end and if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases  which we classify as investments  and the prefunding of employee benefits  our net total debt would have been billion at year end compared to billion at year end  and billion at year end in addition to the available credit mentioned above  we currently have available for issuance million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission and declared effective on february  impact of inflation while management believes that some portion of the increase in sales is due to inflation  it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences 
although we believe there was inflation in retail prices  we experienced deflation in our costs of product due to synergies and the economies of scale created by recent mergers 
by attempting to control costs and efficiently utilize resources  we strive to minimize the effects of inflation on operations 
other issues on january   we changed our fiscal year end to the saturday nearest january of each year 
this change is disclosed in our current report on form k dated january  we filed separate audited financial statements covering the transition period from january   to january   on a current report on form k dated may  these financial statements included kroger and its consolidated subsidiaries before the merger with fred meyer 
during the transition period we had sales of  million  costs and expenses of  million  and net earnings of million 
we indirectly own a interest in the entity that owns the santee dairy in los angeles  california  and have a product supply agreement with santee that requires us to purchase million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually 
the product supply agreement expires on july  upon acquisition of ralphs food less  santee became excess capacity and a duplicate facility 
recently issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  is effective for the kroger co 
as of february  sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the use of the derivative 
we have determined that the adoption of these new accounting standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  which clarifies the application of accounting principals board opinion for certain issues 
the interpretation became effective july   except for the provisions that relate to modifications that directly or indirectly reduce the exercise price of an award and the definition of an employee  which became effective after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf issue nos 
 accounting for certain sales incentives   accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales and incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and  vendor income statement characterization of consideration from a vendor to a retailer become effective for the kroger co 
beginning in the first quarter of these issues address the appropriate accounting for certain vendor contracts and loyalty programs 
the company continues to assess the effect these new standards will have on the financial statements 
we expect the adoption of these standards will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
outlook statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
in particular we expect to reduce net operating working capital compared to the third quarter of by million by the end of the third quarter we define net operating working capital as current operating assets less current operating liabilities 
we do not intend to present net operating working capital as an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
rather we believe this presentation is relevant to an assessment of our financial performance 
as of the end of fiscal  we have reduced net operating working capital million when compared to the fourth quarter of a calculation of net operating working capital based on our definition as of the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter of is provided in the following table fourth quarter fourth quarter in millions cash receivables fifo inventory   operating prepaid and other assets accounts payable   operating accrued liabilities   prepaid veba net working capital we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
during the next two years  kroger plans to grow square footage by year over year 
we expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  natural foods  seafood shops  floral shops  and bakeries 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
our targeted annual earnings per share growth is through the fiscal year ending february  and  thereafter 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of store real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  should reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to total billion  excluding acquisitions 
we intend to use the combination of free cash flows from operations  including reductions in working capital  and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements 
if determined preferable  we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities  entering into sale leaseback transactions  or by issuing additional debt or equity 
based on current operating results  we believe that operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
a decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans  share repurchase programs and general operating activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us to miss our earnings targets  because we obtain some of our sales growth from new square footage 
the grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other grocery retailers  supercenters  club or warehouse stores  and drug stores 
our ability to maintain our current success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and continue to reduce operating expenses 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained  profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our share of sales and net income 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth  and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers 
since gasoline is a low profit margin item with high sales dollars  we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline 
although this negatively affects our gross profit margin  gasoline provides a positive effect on ebitda and net earnings 
we are party to more than collective bargaining agreements with local unions representing approximately  employees 
during we negotiated labor contracts without any material work stoppages 
typical agreements are three to five years in duration and  as agreements expire  we expect to enter new collective bargaining agreements 
in  collective bargaining agreements will expire 
we cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations 
we retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and general liability claims 
it is possible that these claims may cause significant expenditures that would affect the operating cash flows of the company 
our capital expenditures could fall outside of the expected range if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs exceed those budgeted  or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for our products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the costs of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers our gross margin and ebitda will suffer 
interest rate fluctuation and other capital market conditions may cause variability in earnings 
although we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to financial risks  we are still exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuation in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we limit our exposure to rising interest rates through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and interest rate collars 
during  as a result of the merger with fred meyer  the nature and magnitude of our debt portfolio changed significantly  including a permanent reduction in the combined company s variable rate borrowings 
this fundamental change in our debt portfolio resulted in the existing derivative portfolio no longer being aligned with the debt portfolio  and prompted us to eliminate all existing interest rate swaps and cap agreements  at a pre tax cost of million 
we now use derivatives primarily to fix the rates on variable rate debt and set interest rates for future debt issuances 
to do this  we use the following guidelines limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of variable rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  use the average daily bank balance to determine annual variable rate debt amounts  include no leveraged derivative products  and hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
we review compliance with the guidelines annually with the financial policy committee of our board of directors 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the table below provides information about our interest rate derivative and underlying debt portfolio 
the amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the outstanding notional amount of interest rate derivatives 
interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rated debt is based on one month libor using the forward yield curve as of february  the fair value column includes the fair value of those debt instruments for which it is reasonably possible to calculate a fair value and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives as of february  refer to footnotes and of the financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate    average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate it was not reasonably possible to calculate a fair value for million of fixed rate debt 
average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate interest rate caps  interest rate collar the interest rate collar is reset based on the three month libor with the following impact if the three month libor is less than or equal to  we pay for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than  we pay for that three month period  and if the three month libor is greater than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period 
the interest rate caps all have a strike price of based on the one month libor rate
