overview we are an online music company that connects artists directly with their fans worldwide 
we provide music entertainment through our artistdirect network  an integrated network of web sites offering multi media content  music news and information  community around shared music interests  and music related commerce 
as of december   artistdirect featured unique  artist owned artistchannels  and had signed agreements to launch channels with an additional artists 
the artistdirect network also features the ubl  a music search engine on the web  imusic  a popular online community where fans exchange music interests and commentary and digital music  a feature that allows users to download music  both free and paid  stream promotional tracks and listen to internet radio stations on the artistdirect network 
we also operate a music talent agency  the artistdirect agency 
prior to june   we also managed a traditional record label  kneeling elephant records  which we no longer operate 
artistdirect was organized as a california limited liability company in august and conducts operations through a group of affiliated limited liability companies 
from inception through december  our primary activities consisted of developing our business model  recruiting and training employees and developing our infrastructure 
during  our operations consisted primarily of the artistdirect agency and the kneeling elephant records label 
in july  we formed a joint venture to own a controlling interest in ubl  llc 
in september  we launched our first artistchannel 
in june  we expanded content offerings on the ubl and added an online retail store now known as the artistdirect superstore 
also in june  we launched our second artistchannel and  by the end of  we had nine artistchannels in operation 
in february  artistdirect acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of imusic  inc the purchase consideration for imusic was approximately million  including  in cash  a redeemable put option valued at approximately million and the assumption of approximately  in liabilities 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price has been largely allocated to goodwill  which is being amortized over five years 
in may  we engaged in an exchange transaction in which all membership interests in ubl  llc that we did not own were exchanged for membership interests in artistdirect  llc 
the value of the consideration given was approximately million and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price has been largely allocated to goodwill  which is being amortized over five years 
in july  we officially launched the artistdirect network  integrating the ubl and imusic web sites with our artistchannels 
since  our revenue mix has shifted from primarily agency commissions and record label revenue to electronic commerce revenue and online advertising  however  given the recent industry wide decrease in amounts spent on online advertising  we do not know if this trend will continue 
in august  artistdirect acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of mjuice 
com  inc the total purchase consideration for mjuice 
com was approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase price has been largely allocated to goodwill  which is being amortized over five years 
artistdirect has incurred cumulative net losses of million from inception to december  of which approximately million represented stock based compensation expense 
while we expect our net losses to decrease in the future  we do not expect to become profitable in the near future  and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve profitability 
we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  and difficulties encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as electronic commerce 
see risk factors beginning on page for a more complete description of the many risks we face 
our business is evolving rapidly  and therefore we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
on october   artistdirect  llc merged into artistdirect  inc before that time  we operated as a group of limited liability companies and did not incur federal and state income taxes  other than imusic  which is a washington corporation that we acquired in february federal and state income taxes attributable to income during such periods were incurred and paid directly by the members 
accordingly  no discussion of income taxes is included in results of operations beginning on page any tax benefit attributable to losses generated before our conversion will not be available to us 
as a delaware corporation  we are fully subject to federal and state income taxation 
revenue we generate revenue from the artistdirect network  the artistdirect agency  and  prior to june   also generated revenue from kneeling elephant records 
substantially all of our revenue is generated in cash 
trade and barter revenue represented approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  and less than for the year ended december  revenue from the artistdirect network consists primarily of online product sales and advertising revenue as described below revenue from online product sales includes the sale of music and related merchandise  such as apparel  collectibles and accessories  through our artistchannels and the artistdirect superstore

we have experienced seasonality with respect to our online product sales 
in particular  our online product sales in december have  on average  been higher than in other months 
we believe that this trend may continue for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december  and  online product sales revenue constituted approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenue for those periods 
advertising revenue consists primarily of sales of banner advertisements and sponsorships 
in sales of banner advertisements  we principally earn revenue based on the number of impressions or times an advertisement appears on pages viewed within our web sites 
our banner advertising commitments generally range from one to three months 
banner advertising revenue is generally recognized as the impressions are served during the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant obligations of artistdirect remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we typically guarantee a minimum number of impressions to the advertiser 
to the extent that minimum guaranteed page deliveries are not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenue until the guaranteed impressions are delivered 
we also sell to advertisers sponsorships of a web page or event for a specified period of time 
we recognize sponsorship revenue over the period in which the sponsored page or event is displayed 
to the extent that committed obligations under sponsorship agreements are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until the obligations are met

for the years ended december  and  commission revenue constituted approximately and  respectively  of our total net revenue for those periods 
prior to june   revenue from kneeling elephant records was generated from overhead advances and from royalties earned on albums sold by artists signed to the label

reserves were established for possible returns 
during the year ended december   pringles  a division of procter gamble  accounted for and universal music group accounted for of the company s advertising revenue 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we laid off employees 
we expect this to help us decrease our net loss and conserve our cash resources given prevailing market conditions 
we have received notice from nasdaq that our shares of common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq national market and have received a hearing date of april  with nasdaq regarding its decision to delist our shares 
while we believe our common stock will continue to be listed on the nasdaq national market during the pendency of such hearing process  we cannot assure you that our shares will not be delisted after the conclusion of the hearing process 
such delisting or a prolonged decline in the price of our stock may reduce the liquidity of our stock and adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan

to the extent that employees holding options  subject to the rescission offer  accept the offer  the company will record compensation expense for such payments  which could be significant 
the amount of expense recorded for the repurchase of unexercised stock options from employees shall be the sum of the intrinsic value at the original measurement date less any expense related to the intrinsic value recorded up to the acceptance of the rescission offer and the amount of cash paid to the holder that exceeds the lesser of the intrinsic value at the original measurement date or immediately prior to settlement 
the amount of expense that shall be recorded for the repurchase of unexercised non employee options shall be the difference between the amount paid for each option and the fair value of the options on the date the repurchase offer is accepted

the company shall also record as expense for the repurchase of shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options the difference between the cash paid for the repurchase of the shares and the fair value of the shares on the date the repurchase is accepted 
the amount of expense will vary depending on the number of individuals that accept the rescission offer and the company s stock price on the date any rescission is consummated

depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
the acquisitions of imusic  mjuice and the minority interest of the ubl were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase prices have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair value on the acquisition dates 
substantially all of the purchase price of these transactions is attributable to the acquired intangible assets 
as a result  the aggregate excess purchase price over the net tangible assets to date has been estimated to be million and is being amortized over five years  the expected estimated useful life of these assets 
these non cash charges will significantly affect our reported operating results over the next several years
