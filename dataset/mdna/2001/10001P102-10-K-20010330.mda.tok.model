revenue was million in as compared to million in we earned net income of million in as compared to a net loss of million in included in the amounts are approximately million in revenue and a deminimis contribution to net income related to the acquisitions of consumerpatient and armand scott 
included in the net loss for was a pre tax charge of million incurred during the first quarter of related to the write down of goodwill associated with our january acquisition of decision point  inc  a pre tax charge of million incurred during the second quarter of related to the restructuring plan and a pre tax charge of million incurred during the fourth quarter related to the restructuring plan and other severance 
in december  we signed a three year renewal of our field sales force logistics contract with the large pharmaceutical company which runs through this new contract replaces the agreement that was set to expire in as in the past  the renewed contract provides for a fixed management fee component and a fee for service component which is dependent upon the level of service provided 
our operating results improved from a net loss of million in to net income of million in in addition  for the year ended december  our gross profit improved to from in the prior period 
this improvement is primarily due to the increased proportion of promotional and educational services revenue to total revenue 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in field sales force logistics services revenue  which has a lower average gross profit than our promotional and educational services  due to the higher proportion of production costs which are passed through to the customer with no markup 
during  a contract sales service contract terminated 
during the full years ended december  and this contract represented million and million of our revenues  respectively 
certain of our services  particularly symposia and field sales force logistics  have lower gross margin percentages than our historical peer to peer meeting business  while other services  particularly educational conferencing and medical education content development  have higher gross margin percentages than our historical peer to peer meeting business

included in the amounts was a million one time special project that was included in field sales force logistics revenue 
cost of sales increased million  or  from million in to million in gross profit percentage increased from in the prior year to in the current period 
the improved gross profit percentage was primarily due to the increased proportion of promotional and educational services revenue to total revenue 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in field sales force logistics services revenue  which has a lower average gross profit than our promotional and educational services  due to the higher proportion of production costs which are passed through to the customer with no markup 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase  when compared to the amounts  was due to approximately million of personnel related expenses from acquired companies and an increase in amortization expense of approximately million 
the increase in amounts is partially offset by a decrease in bad debts of approximately million and a decrease of certain operating costs of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from in the prior year period to in the current year

the increase in operating income loss as a percentage of revenues was due to the aforementioned increases in revenue as well as the decreases in cost of sales  restructuring charges and goodwill impairment charge as a percentage of revenues 
interest income was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to our higher average cash balance and higher interest rates in the current year period as compared to the prior year period 
the provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and december  reflect estimated federal and state income tax expense benefit at our estimated effective tax rate 
net loss was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december   with approximately per diluted share contribution in net income from the acquisitions of armand scott and consumerpatient 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in this decline primarily resulted from the decrease in marketing and educational services revenue of million offset by the addition of million of revenue from field sales force logistics services 
the decrease in marketing and educational services was primarily due to the loss of revenue from a significant customer  partially offset by an increase in other business 
the increase in field sales force logistics services includes million in revenue from a contract which was terminated during and million in revenue from a short term project which was completed during the fourth quarter of cost of sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased proportion of field sales force logistics and contract sales revenue  which have a lower average gross profit than our historical business due to a higher proportion of production costs which are passed through to the customer with little or no markup 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was due to the net increase in the cost of personnel of approximately million  primarily due to the personnel of acquired companies partially offset by reductions in the workforce related to our restructurings  an increase in bad debts of approximately million  and an increase in other operating costs of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from in the prior year period to in the current year period 
this percentage increase was largely the result of the aforementioned decrease in and change in the mix of revenues for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred provisions for restructuring and other severance of million which involved the reduction of our workforce  consolidation of our facilities  the wind down of our teleservice business  including a disposition of assets  and changes in management 
as a percentage of revenues  this charge represented of revenues for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we determined that the remaining goodwill balance of  associated with the acquisition of decision point  inc in january was impaired 
as a result  we incurred a charge to write down the asset value to zero during the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  this charge represented for the year ended december  operating income loss decreased million from income of million in to a loss of million in operating income loss as a percentage of revenues declined from income of in to a loss of in the decrease in operating income loss as a percentage of revenues was due to the aforementioned increases in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  provisions for restructuring and other severance and noncash charges to write down an impaired asset as a percentage of revenues 
interest income  was million in compared to million of interest income in the increase in interest income was primarily due to our higher average cash balance and higher prevailing interest rates in the current year period as compared to the prior year period 
the provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  and december  reflects estimated federal and state income tax expense partially offset by the utilization of benefits from net operating losses previously not recognized in and the recording of the benefits of the net loss in net income was million or per diluted share for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in net working capital  a decrease of million from december  our primary sources of liquidity as of december  were cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable turnover averaged days for the period ended december  and days for the period ended december  the allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves was million at december  and the increase in accounts receivable from december  to december  was due to more prepayments of accounts receivable balances as of december  related to services 
during  we generated approximately million in cash from operating activities as compared to million during the change in the amount provided by operating activities was primarily related to the increase in accounts receivable 
we believe our ability to generate cash flow from operations is inversely related to revenue growth 
as such  during periods of rapid growth we will use cash  whereas during periods of slow growth or decline we believe we will be able to generate cash from operations 
during  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities which was comprised of million used for business acquisitions  net of acquired cash  and million used to purchase computer  telephone and office furniture and equipment 
in addition  the company may be required to make additional payments related to the business acquisitions based on the attainment of certain performance goals in financing activities during used approximately million of net cash outflows 
the amount used by financing activities was primarily the result of our repurchase of million shares of our common stock in the amount of million offset by proceeds from exercises of stock options in the amount of million 
during  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
during the board expanded this initiative  authorizing the repurchase of an additional  shares 
we have repurchased  shares through december  currently  we believe we have sufficient capital resources to fund our current operations 
should we decide to continue to make acquisitions there may be a need to finance these transactions
