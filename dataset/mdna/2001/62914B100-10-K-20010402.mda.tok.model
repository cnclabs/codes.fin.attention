we are a provider of internet based  electronic government services that help governments use the internet to reduce costs and provide a higher level of service to businesses and citizens 
we enter into contracts with governments and on their behalf design  build and operate internet based portals 
these portals consist of web sites and applications that we build  which allow businesses and citizens to access government information online and complete transactions  including applying for a permit  retrieving driver s license records or filing a form or report 
our unique business model allows us to reduce our government clients financial and technology risks and obtain revenue by charging fees for electronic government services and remitting a portion to our government clients 
our clients benefit because they gain a centralized  customer focused presence on the internet  and businesses and citizens gain a faster  more convenient and more cost effective means to interact with governments 
we also provide internet based applications and services for government procurement through our nic commerce business 
focusing on secretaries of state  our nic conquest business builds uniform commercial code and corporation software applications and provides online services that facilitate electronic filing and document management for governments 
nic technologies designs and develops online election and ethics filing systems for federal  state and local government agencies 
idt provides business to government reporting and filing software for the transportation industry 
at december   we had signed contracts to provide internet based electronic government services for the state governments of arkansas  georgia  hawaii  idaho  indiana  iowa  kansas  maine  montana  nebraska  tennessee  utah and virginia and the city county governments of the city of indianapolis and marion county in  dallas county tx  the city of san francisco ca and the city of tampa fl 
we also serve as a subcontractor to deloitte consulting on the new city of ottawa canada portal 
we typically enter into three to five year contracts with our government clients and manage operations through separate subsidiaries that operate as decentralized business units with a high degree of autonomy 
under these contracts  each local business unit helps its government client implement  develop  manage and enhance a single  comprehensive portal for conducting transactions and delivering information to businesses and citizens online  and we remit to the government a portion of the fee we obtain through use of the portal for information and transactions 
in our government contracts with georgia and iowa  we provide consulting  development and management services for those government portals predominantly under a fixed price model 
subscription based and transaction based fees charged for access to motor vehicle records and corporate filings accounted for over and of our revenues for the years ended december  and we believe that while these applications will continue to be important sources of revenues  their contributions as a percentage of our total revenues will decline as other sources grow 
we charge for access to records on a per record basis and  depending upon government policies  also on a fixed or sliding scale bulk basis 
our fees are set by negotiation with the government agencies that control the records and are typically approved by a government sanctioned oversight body 
we recognize revenues from transactions primarily information access fees and filing fees on an accrual basis net of the transaction fee due to the government  and we bill end user customers primarily on a monthly basis 
we typically receive a majority of payments via electronic funds transfer and credit card within days of billing and remit payment to governments within days of the transaction 
the costs that we pay state agencies for data access are accrued as accounts payable at the time revenue from the access of public information is recognized 
we must remit a certain amount or percentage of these fees to government agencies regardless of whether we ultimately collects the fees 
the pricing of these transactions vary by the type of transaction and by state 
costs of portal revenues consist primarily of telecommunications and data processing costs and payments to certain of our state government clients under revenue and or profit sharing arrangements 
revenues from state portal business units are highly correlated to population  but are also affected by pricing policies established by government entities for public records  the number and growth of commercial enterprises and the government entity s development of policy and information technology infrastructure supporting electronic government

on march   we completed a million cash investment in privately held e filing 
com  inc  a provider of online filing applications for legal services  giving us ownership of of e filing 
com at december  this strategic investment is expected to enable both e filing 
com and nic to expand access to judicial egovernment applications nationwide 
on march   we completed a million cash investment in privately held tidemark computer systems  inc  a provider of egovernment permit applications and related services for local government  giving us ownership of approximately of tidemark at december  this strategic investment is expected to allow tidemark and nic to help communities automate a variety of business processes through mobile and web based applications 
at december   we were closely monitoring our investment in tidemark due to significant liquidity issues inasmuch as tidemark s current liquid resources were sufficient to meet operating requirements only through the end of april at the end of  tidemark was in various stages of merger and acquisition discussions with several companies 
we expected tidemark would be successful in merging its operations with or being acquired by another company 
based on information received in the latter half of march from a company looking to acquire tidemark  we determined that we would not be able to recover the entire carrying value of our investment 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of our investment to its estimated fair value resulting in a noncash impairment loss of approximately million 
in addition  we recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million to offset the deferred tax asset we had recognized relating to our investment in tidemark 
e filing 
com and tidemark are in the early stage of their operations and are incurring net losses 
we regularly review the carrying value of these equity method investments and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired

for additional information on the egs joint venture  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
other recent developments on september   we announced that our third quarter operating results would likely fall short of the consensus analyst revenue and earnings estimates 
concurrent with this announcement  we announced the restructuring of two of our egovernment product businesses  nic commerce and nic technologies  the reorganization of our management team and the consolidation of our marketing efforts 
our lower than expected third quarter operating results were mainly attributable to our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses  which were affected by industry wide post yk delays in government decision making and sales cycles during the first half of these businesses were the main sources of revenue shortfall versus expectations as a result of their management s ineffective forecasting and inadequate response to market signals that new business and revenues would be less than expectations 
in addition  these businesses were the main source of ebitda shortfall versus expectations as a result of expenditures for sustained development  marketing and product delivery efforts to support these operations whose revenue and gross profit impact did not materialize as expected during the quarter 
our response to the inadequate performance of our nic technologies and nic commerce businesses  both of which we have acquired since september  was to initiate a change in leadership  while simultaneously adjusting operational processes and resources to more appropriately size these operations to visible demand and more efficiently align them with other egovernment initiatives across nic 
dan houlihan  the former president of our largest state portal operation in virginia  has assumed day to day management responsibility of nic technologies since july and is responsible for rebalancing the operation to better support the application development needs of nic s growing local and state portal businesses and other growth initiatives across nic 
we announced the appointment of chris boehm as the new president of nic commerce effective november  mr 
boehm joined nic from comptek research  inc  a leading supplier of advanced electronics and data communications systems to international government and industry clients  where he served as president of its software and technical services subsidiary 
mr 
boehm will be responsible for accelerating growth and expanding nic s government eprocurement market share at the local  state  federal  and international levels 
the restructuring involved employee reductions in our marketing division and at our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses 
as a result  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  in the third quarter relating to employee severance costs 
employee severance costs paid through december  totaled  with  accrued at december  for future payments 
cash requirements for the restructuring were funded from available resources 
the employee severance costs relate to severance packages for employees in marketing  product development and administration  of which were terminated by december   with two additional terminations expected in the first quarter of the pre tax savings from these reductions are expected to approximate million annually 
march  exchange offer on march   we exchanged our common stock for the common stock of five affiliated companies  in a transaction referred to as the exchange offer 
prior to the completion of the exchange offer  we were a holding company with no operations of our own 
our exchange offer consolidated five business units as operating subsidiaries under our holding company 
prior to april   our historical financial information reflects the results of our business unit formed to pursue new business opportunities  and not the results of our business units operating in indiana  kansas  arkansas and nebraska 
for example  for the year ended december   revenues for all of our business units were million  while the reported revenues of million for the year ended december  represents months of one of our business units and only nine months of the other four business units 
total expenses are likewise not comparable 
accordingly  we believe that the historical comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  against the year ended december  is not necessarily meaningful 
for additional information on the exchange offer  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
presentation of revenues and cost of revenues in the fourth quarter of  we began to recognize revenues for the access of public information net of the transaction fee due to the government 
previously  the company presented such revenues on a gross basis and accrued the costs that it pays to government agencies for data access as cost of revenues 
we also started to classify our revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software and services 
the portal category includes revenues and cost of revenues of the company s subsidiaries operating state and local government portals 
the software and services category includes revenues and cost of revenues of the company s products segment  which includes the nic conquest  nic technologies and idt subsidiaries  and the company s procurement segment  which includes the nic commerce subsidiary 
all prior periods have been reclassified to present information on a comparable basis 
comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  portal revenues were million for the year ended december   a increase over million for the year ended december  of this increase  was attributable to revenues from our state portal business units that became operational after june  and was from an increase in revenues relating to same state portal volumes states open more than one year

we intend to continue to expand our operations by developing and promoting new products and services and by expanding the breadth and depth of our egovernment product and service offerings 
gross profit rates attributable to new business areas are likely to be different than those associated with our existing business activities 
to the extent such business areas become larger components of our revenues  we would expect a corresponding change in our overall gross profit rate 
service development and operations 
service development and operations expenses consist primarily of the employee expenses incurred to start up  operate and maintain our government portals as well as the expenses incurred to maintain the computer system and information technology infrastructure throughout our various businesses 
service development and operations expenses for the year ended december  were million  a increase over million for the year ended december  of this increase  was attributable to state and local portal business units that became operational after june   was from an increase in same state portal expenses  was from nic commerce  was from nic technologies and was from an increase in corporate level expenses 
excluding acquired businesses  new state and local portal business units that became operational after june  and corporate level expenses  same state portal service development and operations expenses increased over the year ended december  as a result of ongoing technology enhancements and service delivery investment in our state portal partnerships

during the third quarter of  the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million for employee severance costs related to the corporate restructuring of our nic commerce and nic technologies divisions and the consolidation of our marketing efforts  as further discussed above and in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the company also incurred a one time non cash charge of approximately million in the third quarter of due to the adoption of a company wide vacation policy that required the company to recognize a liability for earned but unused employee vacation 
excluding these one time charges  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  of this increase  was attributable to new state and local portal business units that became operational after june   was from nic commerce  was from nic conquest  was from nic technologies and was from idt 
additionally  of the increase was from an increase in corporate level expenses as a result of becoming a public company in july and as a result of our overall growth and positioning for future growth  including strategic infrastructure investments in marketing  public relations  finance  technology and management personnel 
excluding acquired businesses  new state portal business units that became operational after june   corporate level expenses and one time charges  same state portal selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  as a result of continuing overhead cost containment and efficiency efforts in our more mature state portals 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a increase over million for the year ended december  of this increase  was attributable to our four initial business units  was from new state business units that became operational in the second half of and third quarter of and was from nic commerce 
additionally  of the increase was from corporate level expenses as a result of becoming a public company in july and as a result of our overall growth and positioning for future growth  including the addition of corporate level marketing  public relations  finance  technology and management personnel 
stock compensation 
stock compensation for the year ended december  was million and consisted primarily of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to common stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees 
stock compensation increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to compensation expense recognized on stock sales to senior level executives in the first half of and on stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees in late and from february through may  we sold approximately  shares of common stock to key employees and recognized approximately million in compensation expense for the amount by which the fair value of common stock sold exceeded the amount paid 
in addition  we recognized approximately million in compensation expense for the year ended december  relating to stock options 
depreciation and amortization 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to intangible asset amortization resulting from our acquisitions of nic commerce in september  sdr technologies in may  conquest softworks  llc in january  idt in october  and the amortization of the fair value of fully vested warrants issued to aol in august refer to notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
depreciation expense increased by million for the year ended december  as a result of additions to property and equipment throughout and the depreciation of fixed assets from our acquired businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in intangible asset amortization resulting from our march  exchange offer 
certain intangible assets relating to that exchange offer became fully amortized in december   june  and august  depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to an additional quarter of intangible asset amortization in resulting from the exchange offer of million and intangible asset amortization resulting from our acquisition of efed on september  of million 
the remainder of the increase was attributable to additional depreciation expense as a result of additions to property and equipment throughout operating loss 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  excluding non cash charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and the one time charges in the second quarter of relating to the withdrawn common stock offering  the one time charges in the third quarter of relating to our corporate restructuring and vacation liability  and the charges in and relating to the company s application development contracts  operating loss would have been million for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest  taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates  depreciation  amortization  one time charges and other non cash charges related to stock compensation and our application development contracts ebitda was negative million for the year ended december  compared to positive million for the year ended december  ebitda from our state and local portal segment decreased by approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to start up losses in our hawaii  idaho  tennessee and san francisco portals 
our idaho and san francisco portals began generating modest revenues during september  while our hawaii and tennessee portals had not begun to generate revenues at december  we anticipate hawaii and tennessee will begin to generate more substantive revenues in the first and second quarters of excluding the state and local portals that incurred start up losses in  ebitda from our portal operations increased by million primarily as a result of a full twelve months of operating results from our new england and utah portals  which began generating revenues in the third quarter of  and increased same state portal transaction volumes  primarily from our virginia and indiana subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   ebitda from our egovernment products segment  which consists primarily of our nic conquest and nic technologies subsidiaries  was negative million compared to negative million for the year ended december  the decrease in ebitda in was primarily the result of payroll related expenses for product development and product delivery efforts at nic technologies  which precipitated the third quarter restructuring as discussed above and in note to notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
for the year ended december   ebitda from our nic commerce government procurement segment was negative million compared to positive million for the year ended december  the decrease in ebitda in was due primarily to expenditures for business development  marketing and public relations  which also precipitated the third quarter restructuring at nic commerce 
for the year ended december   corporate level expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  as a result of our becoming a public company in july and strategic infrastructure investments as discussed above 
operating loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  excluding non cash charges for stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  and the charges in and relating to the company s application development contracts  operating income would have been million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  ebitda was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  including our initial four business units for the first three months of  pro forma operating income and ebitda would have been million for the year ended december  we do not expect to generate positive ebitda until because of our continued investments in local portals  our aol government guide partnership and our new business plans for nic commerce and nic technologies  which has been positioned to provide the core technology and deployment base for our company wide egovernment growth initiatives 
however  we expect ebitda to improve on a sequential quarter over quarter basis throughout other income  net 
other income  net  primarily reflects interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities portfolio 
we have placed the proceeds from our july  initial public offering in short term  investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities 
other income  net  for the year ended december  reflects less than six months of interest earned on these investments versus a full year of interest earned in we expect other income  net  to continue to fluctuate in relation to the average balance of our cash and marketable securities portfolio  which was approximately million at december  compared to million at december  equity in net loss of affiliates 
for the year ended december   equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have equity method investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the e government services industry  tidemark computer systems and e filing 
com  primarily for strategic purposes 
these companies are in the early stage of their operations and are incurring net losses 
therefore  we expect to continue to record losses on our equity method investments in the foreseeable future 
as noted above  in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a noncash impairment loss of approximately million relating to our investment in tidemark 
income taxes 
we recognized an income tax benefit for the years ended december  and in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer  the conquest merger  the sdr acquisition  the idt acquisition  and certain stock compensation costs 
also  in the fourth quarter of  we provided a valuation allowance for the future tax benefit on the losses we recognized on our investment in tidemark 
in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer and certain stock compensation costs 
we recognized an income tax provision of  for the year ended december  this provision was attributable to a one time million provision for deferred taxes on our conversion to a c corporation and to goodwill amortization relating to the exchange offer and a portion of stock compensation being non deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to additional cash needs particularly attributable to nic commerce  acquired in september  nic technologies  acquired in may  and our idaho  hawaii  tennessee and san francisco portals  which became operational after november and corporate level expenses as a result of our overall growth and positioning for future growth  including planned strategic infrastructure investments in marketing  public relations  finance  technology and management personnel 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  nic made an initial cash payment to aol totaling million in august and an additional payment of  in november  of which million is recorded as a prepaid expense in the consolidated balance sheet at december  we expect operating cash flow to be negative through at least the end of as a result of continued investment in our corporate infrastructure and growth strategies 
however  we expect operating cash flow to improve throughout  turning positive in investing activities resulted in net cash generated of approximately million for the year ended december  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities portfolio used for funding operations and for purchases of property and equipment million  our business combination with conquest softworks  llc million  strategic equity investments in tidemark million and e filing 
com million  direct costs of the sdr acquisition million  our acquisition of idt million  and our investment in egs million 
investing activities for the year ended december  also reflect approximately million in capitalized software development costs mainly from our nic commerce and nic conquest subsidiaries 
investing activities for the year ended december  resulted in net cash used of million  reflecting the purchase of marketable securities with the net proceeds of our july initial public offering  the million cash outlay for our september efed acquisition  and million for purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting million to pay off bank lines of credit assumed in the sdr million and idt million acquisitions  million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and issuances of common stock to employees  million in payments to repurchase common stock and million in payments under capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the net proceeds received from our july initial public offering  a portion of which was used to pay down all amounts outstanding under our operating lines of credit 
in addition  approximately million was received from employee stock purchase and stock option transactions 
at december   the company s total cash and marketable securities balance was million compared to million at december  we believe that our current liquid resources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and significant growth initiatives without the need of additional capital for at least the next twelve months and through the period when we expect to begin to generate positive operating cash flow in however  any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities or obtain a line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
from time to time  we expect to evaluate the acquisition of or investment in businesses and technologies that complement our various egovernment businesses 
acquisitions or investments might impact the company s liquidity requirements or cause the company to sell additional equity securities or issue debt securities 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded net current and non current deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  totaling approximately million 
we estimate that we must generate at least million of future taxable income to realize those deferred tax assets and have considered additional expected taxable losses prior to our projections of taxable income 
to achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income  we intend to pursue our current strategy of adding new local  state and federal government clients  broadening and standardizing our product and service offerings  and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals and procurement and filing applications
