results of operations comparison of fiscal to revenues we derive revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software  which includes ea studio products for dedicated entertainment systems that we call video game systems or consoles such as playstation  playstation and nintendo  ea studio personal computer products or pc  co publishing products that are co published and distributed by us  and affiliated label or al products that are published by third parties and distributed by us 
we also derive revenues from licensing of ea studio products and al products through hardware companies or oem  selling subscriptions on our online gaming service  selling advertisements on our online web pages and selling our packaged goods through our online store 
information about our net revenues for north america and foreign areas for fiscal and is summarized below in thousands increase decrease change north america    europe    asia pacific    japan    international    consolidated net revenues    north america net revenues the decrease in north america net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to o expected declines in sales of playstation and nintendo n titles due to the beginning of the transition to next generation consoles 
playstation net revenues decreased and n net revenues decreased also due to fewer titles shipping in the current year for both platforms 
o a decrease in al revenues primarily due to the acquisition of an affiliate  dreamworks interactive  by electronic arts in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
o offset partially by the launch of playstation platform in north america which generated  in revenue for the year from titles such as madden nfl  ssx  nba live and nhl playstation revenues did not offset the decrease in playstation revenues due to a reduced number of hardware units reaching the market due to hardware component shortages  according to sony 
o offset by a increase in pc revenues due to the shipment of key releases including command conquer red alert and the sims livin large and continued strong catalog sales of the sims 
international net revenues the decrease in international net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to the following o europe s net revenues decreased primarily due to the console transition  lower al sales due to product release slips and fewer hit titles released in the current year  lower pc sales with fewer titles shipping in the period  the strong sales of command conquer tiberian sun tm for the pc in the comparable prior year period  and weakness in the euro currency 
in addition  playstation revenues decreased due to fewer titles shipping during the console transition period with most franchise titles showing significant decreases from the prior year releases 
playstation revenues did not offset the decrease in playstation revenues due to fewer hardware units reaching the market and the weighting of titles specifically appropriate for the north american market rather than the european market 
o asia pacific s net revenues decreased  mainly due to the decrease in playstation revenues as there were no significant new titles released in the current year 
this was offset by sales of playstation titles such as ssx and fifa o offset by japan s net revenues which increased compared to the prior year primarily due to the shipment of playstation titles such as fifa soccer world championship  fifa and ssx 
information about our net revenues by product line for fiscal and is presented below in thousands increase decrease change ea studio pc    playstation    playstation   n a n    online subscriptions    license  oem and other    advertising   n a affiliated label    consolidated net revenues    personal computer product net revenues the increase in sales of pc products for fiscal was primarily attributable to the continued strong sales of the sims  which shipped in the prior year 
key current year releases were command conquer red alert and the sims livin large 
we released pc titles in fiscal compared to titles in fiscal the sims continues to be the number one pc title and has now sold over million copies 
due to the sales of the sims in fiscal  we expect revenues from pc products to be flat or lower in fiscal playstation product net revenues we released playstation titles in fiscal compared to in fiscal as expected  playstation sales decreased for fiscal compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the playstation platform transition and fewer titles 
with the exception of madden nfl  all of our franchises experienced significant decreases from the prior year release 
although our playstation products are playable on the playstation console  we expect sales of current playstation products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america in july the sony agreement  as amended  we are authorized to develop and distribute cd based software products compatible with the playstation 
furthermore  under the terms of an additional licensing agreement entered into with sony computer entertainment of america as of april the playstation agreement  as amended  we are authorized to develop and distribute dvd based software products compatible with the playstation pursuant to these agreements  we engage sony to supply its playstation and playstation cd s for distribution by us 
accordingly  we have limited ability to control our supply of playstation and playstation cd products or the timing of their delivery 
playstation product net revenues we released titles worldwide in fiscal for the playstation key releases for the year included madden nfl  ssx  fifa  nba live and nhl revenue was lower than expected due to the shortage of playstation hardware in the year resulting from component shortages which limited the number of units that could be manufactured  according to sony 
we expect sony to correct these issues for the next fiscal year  and expect revenues from playstation products to grow in fiscal affiliated label product net revenues the decrease in affiliated label net revenues for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the strong sales of final fantasy r viii in the prior year  our acquisition of dreamworks interactive  formerly an al  in the fourth quarter of the prior year  fewer hit al product releases and product release slips in europe 
n product net revenues we released three n titles in fiscal compared to eight titles during fiscal the expected decrease in n revenues for the fiscal year  compared to the prior fiscal year  was primarily due to fewer releases 
the decrease was also due to the weaker market for n products in the current year 
with the expected release of nintendo gamecube in north america in november  per nintendo  we expect revenues for n products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal the key release for the year was the world is not enough 
under the terms of the n agreement  we engage nintendo to manufacture our n cartridges for distribution by us 
accordingly  we have little ability to control our supply of n cartridges or the timing of their delivery 
a shortage of microchips or other factors outside our control could impair our ability to obtain an adequate supply of cartridges 
online net revenues the increase in online revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable to the following o the average number of paying customers for ultima online increased to approximately  for fiscal as compared to over  for fiscal this increase was due to continued strong sales of ultima online  the addition of new events and parties within the ultima worlds and the release of ultima online renaissance in april o we generated over  in subscription revenues for kesmai and worldplay online games for fiscal these products were not part of ea

license  oem and other revenues the decrease in license  oem and other revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of lower license revenue of certain titles on the game boy platform

o the introduction of higher margin playstation products in the current year 
o a decrease in sales of lower margin al and n titles

com marketing and sales expenses due to increased staff required to support the live game site and advertising campaigns run on the aol service promoting the games channel 
in future periods  ea 
com intends to further increase marketing and advertising spending in order to promote our game site and the games channel on aol 
o the amortization of the aol carriage fee  which began with the launch of ea

research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars by for fiscal  primarily attributed to o increase in research and development expenses by ea 
com including expenses incurred by ea core on behalf of ea 
com due to an increase in the number of online projects in development and increased development staff to support these products 
the type of games that will be in development will most likely increase in complexity and depth 
o an increase in development spending for next generation console products including development for the playstation console  xbox and nintendo gamecube 
o the increase is also due to research and development expenses related to the acquisition of dreamworks interactive  a software development company  in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
o increased headcount related costs associated with the formation of our customer relationship management organization for the live game site 
we released a total of new packaged goods products in fiscal compared to new products in fiscal in addition  the ea 
com website launched in october  and has over live games 
network development and support 
the increase in network development and support expenses was primarily due to increased spending for the network infrastructure  and the games channel on the aol service and the amortization of capitalized costs as required under sop associated with the pre launch network infrastructure build 
as a result  we expect network development and support expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future 
charge for acquired in process technology 
fiscal in connection with the acquisition of pogo in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal  we allocated and expensed  of the  purchase price to acquired in process technology 
at the date of acquisition  this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
pogo had various projects in progress at the time of the acquisition 
as of the acquisition date  costs to complete pogo projects acquired were expected to be approximately  in future periods 
we believe there have been no significant changes to these estimates as of march  we currently expect to complete the development of these projects at various dates through fiscal and to publish the projects upon completion 
in conjunction with the acquisition of pogo  we accrued approximately  related to direct transaction and other related costs 
fiscal o in connection with the acquisition of kesmai by ea

amortization of intangibles was  for ea core and  for ea 
com for fiscal amortization of intangibles was  for ea core and  for ea 
com for fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  increased in absolute dollars primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher average cash balances and investing in higher yielding taxable securities in the current year 
those gains were partially offset by realized gains on sales of marketable securities in the prior year 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and fiscal at march   we generated a federal income tax net operating loss 
a substantial portion of this loss will be utilized in a carryback claim with the remainder being carried forward 
a valuation allowance has not been established on this loss carryforward or other net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize them 
net income loss 
in absolute dollars  reported net income loss decreased in fiscal primarily related to lower revenues as well as higher costs and expenses compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the beginning of the transition period to next generation console systems

impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the terms of sfas and sfas are effective as of the beginning of the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  the company is determining the effect of sfas  and on its financial statements 
in april  the emerging issues task force issued no 
eitf  accounting for consideration from a vendor to a retailer in connection with the purchase or promotion of the vendor s products  which states that consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor s products is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement 
that presumption is overcome and the consideration can be categorized as a cost incurred if  and to the extent that  a benefit is or will be received from the recipient of the consideration 
that benefit must meet certain conditions described in eitf the consensus should be applied no later than in annual or interim financial statements for periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this consensus on its statement of operations 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies the legacy currency and the one common legal currency known as the euro 
from january  through june  the countries will be able to use their legacy currencies or the euro to transact business 
by july   at the latest  the conversion to the euro will be complete at which time the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
the fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies have eliminated exchange rate risk among the member countries 
the conversion to the euro has reduced the number of forward contracts that we use to hedge the exchange rate risk 
the forward contracts that were used to hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single euro hedge contract and the intercompany transactions among subsidiaries within the european union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk 
risk factors electronic arts business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows risk factors relating to our core business platform transitions such as the one now occurring typically depress the market for video game software until new platforms achieve a wide market acceptance when new video game platforms are announced or introduced into the market  consumers typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms in anticipation of new platforms being available 
during that period  sales of our video game products can be expected to slow or even decline until new platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance 
we are currently in such a transition 
sony shipped its playstation product in japan  north america and europe in calendar year for the december quarter  manufacturing shortages  resulting in the delay of a significant number of shipments of playstation units in north america and europe  have adversely affected our results of operations 
in addition  nintendo announced that its new console system  nintendo gamecube  will be released in calendar year in japan and north america and in calendar year in europe 
microsoft announced that its new console system  xbox  will be released in calendar year in north america and japan and calendar year in europe 
delays in the launch or shortages of these platforms could also adversely affect our sales of products for these platforms 
current sales of our products for the existing playstation and nintendo platforms have been adversely affected by the pending introduction of new platforms 
we expect this trend to continue until one or more of these new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers 
new video game platforms create additional technical and business model uncertainties large portions of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms such as the sony playstation 
the success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful 
sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected 
conversely  if we do not develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinue development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  the sega dreamcast console launched in japan in early and in the united states in september of we have developed no products for this platform 
had this platform achieved wide market acceptance  our revenue growth would have been adversely affected 
similarly  we released a variety of products for the new sony platform  the playstation the shortages of playstation units has adversely affected our results  and if that platform does not achieve wide acceptance by consumers  we will have spent a disproportionate amount of our resources for this platform 
similarly  we are developing products for the xbox and nintendo gamecube 
if these platforms do not achieve wide commercial acceptance  our revenue growth will be adversely impacted 
product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia personal computers  or pcs  are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
for example  the world is not enough for the playstation and emperor battle for dune for the pc  which were expected to ship in fiscal will not be released until fiscal due to development delays 
additionally  development risks for cd rom and dvd products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year 
our business is both seasonal and cyclical our business is highly seasonal with a significant percentage of our revenues occurring in the december quarter 
in our fiscal  we expect these seasonal trends to be magnified by general industry factors  including the current platform transition  anticipated fall launches of the xbox and nintendo gamecube in north america and the economic slowdown in the united states 
in addition  we are continuing to invest significantly in our online operation  ea 
com 
our business is also cyclical  video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  and decline as more advanced platforms are being introduced 
as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging  buying patterns may change 
purchases of products for older platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new platforms 
we are currently in such a platform transition 
sega introduced its latest platform in calendar year  and sony shipped its playstation console in japan  north america and europe in calendar year nintendo announced that its new console system  nintendo gamecube  will be released in calendar year in japan and north america and in calendar year in europe 
microsoft announced that its new console system  xbox  will be released in calendar year sales of our current products for the current nintendo and sony platforms have already been adversely affected  and we expect this trend to continue 
the impact of e commerce and online games on our business is not known while we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of our packaged products  we believe that such form of distribution will become a more significant factor in our business in the future 
e commerce is becoming an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers 
how that form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution  at which we have historically had success  and over what time period  is uncertain 
in addition  we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and become a significant factor in the interactive games business generally 
we do not know how that increase generally  or the emerging business of ea 
com specifically  will affect the sales of packaged goods 
our business  our products  and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy rules in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory while of course the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  in response to recent events  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products our agreements with hardware licensors  which are also our chief competitors  typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
for example  in prior years  we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors 
such occurrences would harm our business and adversely affect our financial performance 
additionally  we have not negotiated a publishing agreement with nintendo for the nintendo gamecube platform and we do not know whether the terms of this agreement will be favorable 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to our business many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
risk factors relating to our online business because of ea 
com s limited operating history  it will be difficult to evaluate its business and prospects ea 
com s business is still in the developing stages  so evaluating its business and prospects will be more difficult than would be the case for a more mature business 
we will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced in launching a new business  and we may not achieve our goals or may be compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the business 
these uncertainties as to the future operations of ea 
com will increase the difficulty we face in completing and pursuing the essential plans for the development of the business and will also make it more difficult for our stockholders and securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business 
ea 
com has a history of losses and expects to continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability ea 
com has incurred substantial losses to date  including the current fiscal year 
we expect ea 
com to continue to incur losses as it develops its business 
ea 
com will be required to maintain the significant support  service and product enhancement demands of online users  and we cannot be certain that ea 
com will produce sufficient revenues from its operations to support these costs 
even if profitability is achieved  ea 
com may not be able to sustain it over a period of time 
our agreements with america online may not prove successful to the development of ea 
com s business we have a series of agreements with america online aol for the offering of our games for online play 
these agreements require that we make substantial guaranteed payments to aol and that we commit our resources to the pursuit of the online game opportunity 
we cannot be assured that the substantial costs associated with the aol agreements will be justified by the revenues generated from that relationship 
in addition  restrictions included in the aol agreements limiting other channels we may develop for offering online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution strategies 
the success for us of the aol agreements will also be a result of aol s performance under the agreements  a factor over which we will have very little control 
we have very limited experience with online games and may not be able to operate this business effectively offering games solely for online play is a substantial departure from our traditional business of selling packaged software games 
we have employed various pricing models  including subscription fees  pay to play fees and advertising 
we have very little experience with developing optimal pricing strategies for online games and no experience in pay to play pricing or in securing advertising revenues for online services 
similarly  we are inexperienced in predicting usage patterns for our games 
because of our inexperience in this area  we may not be effective in achieving success that may otherwise be attainable from offering our games online 
online games have risks that are not associated with our traditional business online games  particularly multiplayer games  pose risks to player enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales 
players frequently would not be acquainted with other players  which may adversely affect the playing experience 
social issues raised by a player s conduct may impact the experience for other players 
we have not determined whether or how we might monitor or proctor player behavior that impairs the game experience 
in addition  there are substantial technical challenges to be met both in the introduction of our games online and in maintaining an effective game playing environment over time 
also  hacking and spamming has become a serious problem for online sites  and significant hacking and spamming could seriously interfere with online game play 
if these risks are not successfully controlled and technical challenges resolved  potential customers for our games may be unwilling to play in sufficient volume to allow us to attain or sustain profitability 
we may not be able to obtain the required licenses to offer our games online if we are unable to reach terms with certain licensors for our games  we will not be able to offer certain of our games for online play 
many of electronic arts most popular games feature characters  trademarks  people or concepts for which we have licenses from third parties 
as an example  our ea sports products typically contain content licensed from a sports and players association 
in certain instances  the terms of these licenses will not allow us to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license 
we cannot be certain that the licensors will be amenable to a license for online games involving their content or  even if they are  that we will be able to reach terms with them for such use 
we may be forced to agree to terms that ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market 
proliferation and assertion of patents poses serious risks to the business of ea 
com many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used internet technologies 
additionally  many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of older technologies 
several such patents have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we will incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
development of ea 
com s business will require significant capital  and we cannot be assured that it will be available ea 
com will not be successful if it does not receive the very substantial financing that will be required to develop its business 
electronic arts has agreed to provide a limited amount of funding to ea 
com  but this financing alone may not be sufficient for the development of ea 
com s business 
any additional funding that is obtained from ea may either be treated as a revolving credit advance or would increase ea s retained interest in ea 
com and correspondingly decrease the interest of the holders of outstanding shares of class b common stock 
the attraction of additional equity or debt financing for ea 
com from third parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms that result in significant dilution to class a and class b common stockholders or interest or other costs and debt related restrictions on the operation of the business 
to date  nearly all funding except warrants and cash from revenues has been provided by ea 
if use of the internet does not continue to develop and reliably support the demands placed on it by electronic commerce  ea 
com s business will be harmed ea 
com s success depends upon growth in the use of the internet as a medium for playing games 
the use of the internet for sophisticated games like ours is relatively new 
our business would be seriously harmed if o use of the internet does not continue to increase or increases more slowly than expected  o the infrastructure for the internet does not effectively support online game play  o concerns over the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions  or o government regulations regarding internet content  privacy or other conditions impede the effectiveness of the internet to users 
capacity restraints may restrict the use of the internet as a forum for game play  resulting in decreased demand for our products the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by increased usage or the limited capacity of networks to transmit large amounts of data 
other risks associated with commercial use of the internet could slow its growth  including o outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of the network infrastructure  o slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products  and o limited availability of cost effective  high speed access 
delays in the development or adoption of new equipment standards or protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or increased governmental regulation  would cause the internet to fail to gain  or lose  viability as a means of game playing 
if these or any other factors cause use of the internet for commerce to slow or decline  the internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace 
this  in turn  would result in decreased demand for ea 
com s products and services 
to become and remain competitive  ea 
com must continually develop and expand new content 
this is inherently risky and expensive 
ea 
com s success depends on our ability to develop products and services for the ea 
com site and our ability to continually expand the content on that site 
our agreement with aol requires us to develop new games under our relationship with aol 
we cannot assure you that products will be developed on time  in a cost effective manner  or that they will be successful 
we may not be able to respond to rapid technological change the market for internet products and services is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
both in completing the design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter  we will be required to continually improve performance  features  reliability and capacity of our network infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in responding rapidly or in a cost effective manner to such developments 
increasing governmental regulation of the internet could limit the market for our products as internet commerce continues to evolve  we expect that federal  state and foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
it is possible that legislation could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability  taxation or other increased costs  any of which could limit the growth of electronic commerce generally 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for ea 
com s products 
our revenues have been heavily dependent on a single product and would be adversely affected if that product s popularity were to decline in the near term  ea 
com s revenues to date have consisted primarily of revenues from sales of our online product ultima online  and we would be adversely affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason and not be replaced 
we expect the online game market to become increasingly competitive  and it is possible that other producer s current or future games could cause our revenue from ultima online to decline 
in addition  popularity of ultima online could decline over time simply because of consumer preference for new game experiences 
we invest very heavily in research and development and network technology and operations for ea 
com  and we cannot be assured that we will achieve revenues that validate this level of spending we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  very heavily in research and development and network technology and operations for our website and online games 
we will need to expand ea 
com s revenues substantially for it to achieve profitability with these levels of expenditure being required  and we may not be able to do so 
if we cannot increase revenues to profitable levels  the value of ea 
com will be impaired 
in order to develop the broad game offerings that we envision for our online operations it will be necessary to engage in significant developmental efforts both to adapt existing ea games to the online format and to create new online games 
our agreements with aol require us to maintain a substantial commitment to online game development and we cannot be assured that we will realize acceptable returns from this investment 
online product development schedules are unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult online product development schedules  particularly for internet based games are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools  internet latency issues  a learning process to better understand internet based game mechanics  and research and experimentation associated with development for new online technologies 
additionally  development risks for internet based products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because of the challenges associated with game testing  live beta testing  integration into network servers and integration on to the games web site and may impact the release go live dates of products during a particular quarter 
several online products currently under development are experiencing development delays and will be released later than planned 
our revenues and operating costs are dependent on our ability to meet our product go live schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues falling short of analysts expectations  with no corresponding decrease in expenses  resulting in increased operating losses for ea 
com 
general risk factors because of the intense competition for qualified technical  creative  marketing and other personnel  we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for our businesses the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development of online businesses and management of our online and core businesses continues to be extremely competitive  and we may not be able to attract and retain the employees we need 
in addition  the cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area the location of our headquarters and largest studio has increased dramatically  and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations for the twelve months ended march  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended march  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
while we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot control translation issues 
for example  our european revenues in fiscal were adversely impacted by a devaluation of the euro and british pound as compared to the prior year 
the devaluation had an adverse effect for the year on our sales and net income 
any of these factors may significantly harm our business 
increased difficulties in forecasting results during platform transition periods  where the success of our products is significantly impacted by the changing market for our products  forecasting our revenues and earnings is more difficult than in more stable or rising product markets 
the demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than we anticipate  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings 
at launch  sony shipped only half of the number of playstation units to retail in north america than it had originally planned  and it shipped significantly fewer units than planned at launch in europe as well 
shortages were announced as being caused by shortages of components for manufacturing 
due to these shortages  our results of operations for fiscal have been adversely affected 
consequently  depending on the number and the timing of units actually available  these shortages may adversely impact our sales of playstation products in fiscal we cannot predict the impact of recent actions and comments by the securities and exchange commission sec and fasb recent actions and comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting 
in addition  the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  some of which represent a significant change from current industry practices 
for example  in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants 
in response to numerous requests for interpretive guidance of sab  the effective date of the standard has been delayed twice 
sab became effective during the first quarter of fiscal sab did not have a material effect on the underlying strength or weakness of our consolidated business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product shipments and cash flows 
fluctuations in stock price due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics businesses or the securities markets in general 
for example  during fiscal year  the price per share of our class a common stock ranged from to 
because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies  thereby  limiting our risk 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately  in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  european currency units euro  canadian dollars  japanese yen and other currencies 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value

the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
we also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity 
at march   our cash equivalents  short term and long term investments included debt securities of  notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations
