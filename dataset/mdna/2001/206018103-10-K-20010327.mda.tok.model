using our technology insight and skills  we assist our clients to define  design  develop and deploy e business solutions that enhance their competitive positions 
in  our management team began executing a strategy of providing high value added e business services and emphasizing relationships with leading technology providers aligned with our e business focus 
since the initiation of that strategy  we have successfully transitioned to providing e business services  which is now the primary source of our revenue as evidenced by a improvement in our average hourly bill rates since as compared with as a result of that change in strategy  we also experienced significant revenue growth since through the second quarter of after which time the market for e business services began to deteriorate and our revenue declined 
we have initiated cost reduction measures including a significant reduction in our staffing levels to more closely align our cost structure with anticipated future revenue opportunities 
we have also narrowed our focus service offerings around o strategy we help clients create e business strategies  o enterprise portals we enable clients to present a unified view of their company to their customers over the internet  through television and mobile devices  o content chains we enable our clients to efficiently produce and manage compelling content comprised of rich media  including video  audio  graphics and d models  and o interactive television we deliver interactive television and entertainment on demand solutions  extending the reach of e business to mass audiences 
given our shift in strategy  our results of operations prior to do not necessarily reflect our current business 
revenue we derive our revenue from fees for services that are generated on an engagement by engagement basis 
in  we derived approximately of revenue from time and materials contracts 
we recognize revenue generated under time and materials contracts as the services are provided 
for fixed price contracts  which accounted for the balance of our revenue  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
using this method  we recognize revenue proportionate to the percentage of units of labor incurred to the date of measurement relative to the estimated total units of labor at completion 
revenue excludes expenses reimbursed by clients 
in  our largest client accounted for of our revenue 
another client accounted for and of revenue in and  respectively 
we experienced a significant decline in our revenue in the second half of compared with the first half of the year 
with the continued weakness in the economy at large and the market for e business services in general  we have initiated cost reduction measures to more closely align our cost structure with near term future revenue opportunities 
in the first quarter of  we expect to report a charge of million to million in connection with employee severance and the elimination of excess office space and equipment 
expenses our technical staff expenses consist of the cost of salaries  payroll taxes  health insurance and workers compensation for technical staff personnel assigned to client engagements and unassigned technical staff personnel  and fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with a client engagement 
selling and administrative staff expenses consist of the cost of salaries  payroll taxes  health insurance and workers compensation for selling  marketing and administrative personnel  and all commissions and bonuses whether paid to technical or administrative staff 
other expenses consist of all non staff related costs  such as occupancy costs  travel  business insurance  business development  recruiting  training and depreciation 
excluding the first quarter charge of million to million associated with our recently announced cost reduction measures  we expect our expenses will decline from recent levels in absolute dollars as a result of those actions
