item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in business risks below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview vitria was incorporated in october we initially generated revenues exclusively through consulting contracts with third parties and government grants from the national institute of standards and technology  or nist 
in june  we commercially released our first product 
with the initial release of this product  we accelerated the development of our sales and marketing organizations 
we have incurred significant losses since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we derive revenues primarily from two sources licenses and services and other 
since the introduction of our product in  licenses have become our primary source of revenues 
our product is typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term  with pricing based on the number of systems or applications managed 
we record license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  and delivery of our product has occurred 
for electronic transmissions  we consider our product to have been delivered when the access code to download the software from the internet has been provided to the customer 
service and other revenues include product maintenance  consulting  training and government grants 
customers who license businessware normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide for unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a specified term  which is typically twelve months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
a majority of our customers use third party system integrators to implement our products 
customers typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials basis and recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services which are sold on a per student basis and recognized as the classes are attended 
our government grant revenues have significantly decreased over the past three years 
our government grants ended in april and we do not expect to recognize future government grant revenues except to the extent to which they are currently recorded in deferred revenue 
we market our product through our direct sales force and augment our marketing efforts through relationships with system integrators  value added resellers and technology vendors 
while our revenues to date have been derived primarily from accounts in the united states  we opened an office in the united kingdom in june and in japan  australia  france  germany  italy  and the netherlands in and plan to expand further in europe and asia 
during  we recognized approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
we believe international revenues will become a more significant component of our total revenues as our operations grow 
to date  we have not experienced significant seasonality of revenues 
we expect that future results may be affected by the fiscal or quarterly budget cycle of our customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in  and of total revenues in in  revenues from kpmg consulting  level and nist accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
in  revenues from sprint accounted for of total revenues 
in  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenues 
while our dependence on any single customer has been declining over the past three years  we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a large percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
therefore  the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and the overall cost effectiveness of our products 
while revenues had grown sequentially each quarter at a rapid pace during the first three quarters of fiscal year  our revenues for the fourth quarter ended december  reflected a slight decline sequentially from our revenues in the third quarter 
this sequential decline was due principally to a slowdown in our order activity from customers in the telecommunications industry 
during fiscal year  revenues are expected to grow at a much slower pace than in prior periods due primarily to the ongoing slowdown in the telecommunications industry combined with a general slowdown in it spending in other vertical markets 
we have a limited operating history that makes it difficult to predict future operating results 
we believe our success requires expanding our customer base and continuing to enhance our businessware products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in sales  marketing and research and development and expect to incur operating losses for at least the next eighteen months 
our revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues  and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenues from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
revenues from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements for which we have been paid or have a valid receivable are recorded as deferred revenues 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenues during the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our future operating results will depend on many factors  including the following 
size and timing of customer orders and product and service delivery  
level of demand for our professional services  
changes in the mix of our products and services  
actions taken by our competitors  including new product introductions and pricing changes  
costs of maintaining and expanding our operations  
timing of our development and release of new and enhanced products  
costs and timing of hiring qualified personnel  
success in maintaining and enhancing existing relationships and developing new relationships with system integrators  
technological changes in our markets  including changes in standards for computer and networking software and hardware  
deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of product enhancements or new products  
delays in our ability to recognize revenues as a result of the decision by our customers to postpone software delivery  
customer budget cycles and changes in these budget cycles  
availability of customer funds for software purchases given external economic factors  and 
costs related to acquisition of technologies or businesses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december   as well as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
this information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements contained in this annual report and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this information 
you should read this information in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter

license revenues increased from million in to million in license revenues increased over to million in these increases were the result of the growth in the number of licenses to new customers and to a higher average transaction size 
our average transaction size has increased due to larger deployments by our customers 
during fiscal year  revenues are expected to grow at a much slower pace than in prior periods primarily due to the ongoing slowdown in the telecommunications industry combined with a general slowdown in it spending in other vertical markets 
service and other 
service and other revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in the substantial increase in service revenues began in the fourth quarter of due to the growth of maintenance  support and consulting revenues associated with license agreements signed in earlier periods 
these service revenues continued to increase each quarter of and as we supported a number of new deployments of our product 
service and other revenues include government grant contract revenues  which ended in april we do not expect to recognize future government grant revenues except for  which has been recorded in deferred revenue 
revenue recognition for this deferred government grant revenue is dependent upon the results of a government audit 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues increased from  in to  in cost of license revenues consists of royalty payments to third parties for technology incorporated in our product 
we began incurring royalty payment obligations in the first quarter of due to the licensing to our customers of a product that incorporated third party technology 
the increase of  from to is due to the rapid growth of our license product sales  some of which incorporate third party technology 
measured as a percentage of license sales  the cost of license sales decreased from in to in as more revenue came from products that did not contain third party technology 
cost of license revenues varies as it is dependent upon the third party technology incorporated into our products and the buying patterns of our customers 
we expect the cost of license revenue to continue to increase 
however  as a percentage of license revenue  we do not expect any significant variation in the cost of license revenues from the past two years 
service and other 
cost of service and other revenues consists of salaries  facility costs  travel expenses and payments to third party consultants incurred in providing customer support  training and implementation services 
cost of service and other revenues also includes costs associated with government grants which are exactly equal to the grant revenues recognized 
cost of service and other revenues was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of our service and other revenues  these costs represented in  in i and in the increase of million from to resulted from hiring additional support  training and implementation personnel  increased utilization of third party consultants  and higher travel expenses associated with an increased number of customer implementations 
from to  cost of service and other revenues increased million due primarily to the continued hiring of services personnel as well as higher travel costs related to increasing number of implementations 
we expect that cost of service and other revenues will continue to increase in dollar amount as we continue to expand our customer support organization to meet anticipated customer demand 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions  field office expenses  travel  entertainment and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  and to million in the million increase in sales and marketing expenses from to resulted from hiring additional sales and marketing personnel and from increased commission expense driven by the growth in revenues 
sales and marketing expenses increased million from to as we continued to rapidly add sales and marketing personnel as well as launch our first advertising campaign 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts  establish additional us and international sales offices and increase promotional activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements to existing products  and quality assurance activities 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  and the cost of consulting resources that supplement the internal development team 
costs of developing software for external use that may have been eligible for capitalization have not been material and we have expensed all of these costs as incurred 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  and to million in the increase of million for compared to was primarily attributable to increases in personnel expenses and contractor fees 
the million increase from to was primarily the result of higher salary expenses related to additional research and development personnel  higher facilities costs associated with the increase in personnel  and increased usage of third party consultants to assist with research and development programs 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and that these expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries for administrative  executive and finance personnel  information systems costs  outside professional service fees and allowances for doubtful accounts 
these expenses increased from million in to million in and to million in the increase of million from to was attributable to increases in personnel expenses as we continued to add personnel to support internal operations 
the million increase from to was attributable to increases in personnel expenses  recruiting fees associated with our headcount growth  outside professional service fees and the allowance for doubtful accounts in response to the broadening of our customer base and increasing accounts receivable balances 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in dollar amounts as a result of our growing operations 
amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation includes the amortization of unearned employee stock based compensation and expenses for stock granted to consultants in exchange for services 
employee stock based compensation expense is amortized over a five year vesting period using the multiple option approach 
we amortized employee stock based compensation expense of million in  million in and million in we expect to record employee stock based compensation expenses of approximately million  million   and  for the years ending december    and  respectively 
unearned compensation expense will be reduced in future periods to the extent that options are terminated prior to vesting 
we recorded expenses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  in connection with stock issued for services 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased from  in  to million in  and to million in the increases are due to increased interest income on the proceeds of our initial public offering in september of and our follow on public offering in february of provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of  for the year ended december  the provision relates to income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions  state income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes incurred on software license revenues 
as of december   the company had approximately million and million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset further taxable income 
such net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through to the extent that they are not utilized 
because the realization of the loss carryforward benefits cannot be reasonably assured  we have set up a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we did not record an income tax provision in or as we had cumulative net operating losses in all tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources we raised approximately million in september from an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and issuance costs 
prior to the offering we had financed our operations through private sales of common and preferred stock  with cumulative net proceeds of million 
in february  we raised approximately million from a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and issuance costs 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  in short term investments and million in working capital with no outstanding long term debt  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments and million in working capital with no outstanding long term debt at december  net cash used in operating activities was million in net cash generated from operating activities was million in and million in net cash used to fund operating activities in reflects net losses  offset in part by increases in deferred revenues 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributed to an increase in deferred revenue and amortization of deferred stock based compensation  which was offset almost entirely by an increase in net loss 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributed to a decrease in net loss and an increase in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
in  net cash used in investing activities included purchases of marketable debt securities of million and purchases of fixed assets of million 
in  net cash used in investing activities consisted of equity investments of million made in several private companies  purchases of marketable debt securities of million  proceeds from maturities of marketable debt securities totaling million and million for the purchase of fixed assets 
net cash generated from financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash generated from financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred and common stock 
at december   we had operating lease commitments of million 
we expect to experience significant growth in our operating expenses into the forseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
if the company ever needed to seek additional financing  there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms and not dilutive to our stockholders 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  is required to be adopted by vitria effective january  and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows when adopted 
we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities 
in december  the security and exchange commission issued staffing accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab  and amended it in march and june sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements for all public registrants 
we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statement position or results of operations 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no  or fin fin clarifies the application of apb no 
and  among other issues  clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the application of fin has not had a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial position of vitria is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses in these areas 
as we expand our operations internationally  we will also become subject to risks associated with currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our investments of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in short term securities with maturities of less than one year 
if a one percentage point change in interest rates were to have occurred on december  or december   such a change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure 
business risks in addition to the risks discussed in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our business is subject to the business risks set forth below 
risks related to vitria since our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects  our future financial performance may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
we were incorporated in october until november  we were engaged primarily in research and development of our initial product 
we licensed our first product in november because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of our market are unproven 
as a result of our limited operating history  we have limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our business 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and challenges we might encounter because we are in the early stages of development in a new and rapidly evolving market 
although we have in the past reported net income available to stockholders  we cannot guarantee we will do so in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception as we funded the development of our products and the growth of our organization 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we intend to continue investing heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
as a result  we are likely to report future operating losses and cannot guarantee we will report net income in the future 
our operating results fluctuate significantly and an unanticipated decline in revenue may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
although we have had significant revenue growth in recent quarters  our growth rates may not be sustainable and prospective investors should not use these past results to predict future operating margins or results 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price is likely to decline 
period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily a good predictor of our future performance 
while revenues had grown sequentially each quarter at a rapid pace during the first three quarters of fiscal year  our revenues for the fourth quarter ended december  reflected a slight decline sequentially from our revenues in the third quarter 
this sequential decline was due principally to a slowdown in our order activity from customers in the telecommunications industry 
during fiscal year  revenues are expected to grow at a much slower pace than in prior periods due primarily to the ongoing slowdown in the telecommunications industry combined with a general slowdown in it spending in other vertical markets 
our revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders and payments and the date of product delivery 
historically  a substantial portion of revenues in a given quarter have been recorded in the third month of that quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in the closing of orders would have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
since our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenues and because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in the recognition of revenue from one or more license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and cause unexpected results 
our quarterly results will depend primarily upon entering into new or follow on contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract was signed  and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
our product may not achieve market acceptance  which could cause our revenues to decline 
deployment of our product requires interoperability with a variety of software applications and systems and  in some cases  the ability to process a high number of transactions per second 
if our product fails to satisfy these demanding technological objectives  our customers will be dissatisfied and we may be unable to generate future sales 
failure to establish a significant base of customer references will significantly reduce our ability to license our product to additional customers 
our revenues will likely decline if we do not develop and maintain successful relationships with system integrators 
system integrators install and deploy our products and those of our competitors  and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
some system integrators engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing  and implementation and support of our product than we would otherwise have to  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of the system integrators 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
we rely upon these firms for recommendations of our product during the evaluation stage of the purchasing process  as well as for implementation and customer support services 
a number of our competitors have strong relationships with these system integrators and  as a result  these system integrators may recommend competitors products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have relationships with a greater number of these system integrators and  therefore  have access to a broader base of enterprise customers 
our failure to establish or maintain these relationships would significantly harm our ability to license and successfully implement our software product 
in addition  we rely on the industry expertise and reach of these firms 
therefore  this failure would also harm our ability to develop industry specific products 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop and maintain these relationships 
our operating results could be adversely affected if these efforts do not generate license and service revenues necessary to offset this investment 
we may suffer product deployment delays  a lower quality of customer service and increased expenses if sufficient system integrator implementation teams are not available 
system integrators help our customers install and deploy our product 
these system integrators are not contractually required to implement our product  and competition for these resources may preclude us from obtaining sufficient resources to provide the necessary implementation services to support our needs 
if the number of installations of our product exceeds our access to the resources provided by these system integrators  we will be required to provide these services internally  which would significantly limit our ability to meet our customers implementation needs and increase our expenses 
in addition  we cannot control the level and quality of service provided by our current and future implementation partners 
because a small number of customers have in the past accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer order 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of total revenues in the fiscal year ended december  our license agreements do not generally provide for ongoing license payments 
therefore  we expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenues in future quarters 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability  breadth and depth of our products  and cost effectiveness of our products 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our product and services would reduce our future revenues 
our sales are concentrated in the telecommunication  manufacturing  financial services and energy industries  and if our customers in these markets decrease their information technology spending  or we fail to penetrate other industries  our revenues may decline 
we expect to continue to direct our sales and marketing efforts toward companies in the telecommunications  manufacturing  financial services and energy industries 
given the high degree of competition and the rapidly changing environment in these industries  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue sales in these industries at current levels 
in addition  we intend to market our product in new vertical markets 
customers in these new vertical markets are likely to have different requirements and may require us to change our product design or features  sales methods  support capabilities or pricing policies 
if we fail to successfully address these new vertical markets we may experience decreased sales in future periods 
during the fourth quarter of  companies in the telecommunications industry began sharply decreasing their capital expenditures as the us economy contracted 
this decrease in spending and the overall contraction in the us economy negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenues and may continue to negatively impact our revenues for the foreseeable future 
failure of our current or potential internet customers to receive necessary funding could harm our business 
some of our customers include internet companies 
most privately and publicly held internet companies require outside cash sources to continue operations 
to the extent additional funding is less available for internet companies as a result of a stock market decline or other factors  demand for our products may decline significantly  thereby reducing our sales 
on sales we do generate from internet companies  we may need to defer recognizing revenue until payment is received 
the recent downturn in the us economy may cause a decline in capital allocations  thus reducing our revenue and affecting our accounts receivable 
the recent downturn in the us economy may cause a decline in capital allocations for software purchases 
the delay in capital expenditures may cause a decrease in sales  may cause an increase in our accounts receivable and may make collection of license and support payments from our customers more difficult 
in addition  if our customers seek protection from creditors through formal bankruptcy filings  we may experience an increase in delinquent accounts receivable 
our markets are highly competitive and  if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
the market for our product is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition is expected to increase in the future 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenues 
our current competitors include bbi and eai vendors 
we face direct and indirect competition from vendors offering business to business integration bbi and enterprise application integration eai  as well as other aspects of our products 
some of these vendors include bea systems  inc  crossworlds software  inc  ibm corporation  sybase  inc  tibco software  inc  and webmethods  inc 
in the future  some of these companies may expand their products to enhance existing  or to provide  process automation and real time analysis functionality 
additionally  in this fast growing market  these or other competitors may merge to attempt the creation of a more competitive entity  or one that offers a broader solution than we provide 
internal it departments 
in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide for some or all of the functionality of our businessware product 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process automation efforts will continue to be a principal source of competition for the foreseeable future 
in particular  it can be difficult to sell our product to a potential customer whose internal development group has already made large investments in and progress towards completion of systems that our product is intended to replace 
other software vendors 
we may in the future also encounter competition from major enterprise software developers including oracle corporation  peoplesoft  inc  and sap ag 
in addition  microsoft corporation has announced its intention to introduce products that could compete with some aspects of our product 
other companies that target the enterprise software market may also try to expand into the integration market 
many of our competitors have more resources and broader customer relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
although we believe that our solutions generally compete favorably with respect to these factors  our market is relatively new and is evolving rapidly 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors  especially those with significantly greater resources 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our product is often used by our customers to deploy mission critical solutions used throughout their organization 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our product  including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
many customers will be addressing these issues for the first time 
as a result  we or other parties  including system integrators  must educate potential customers on the use and benefits of our product and services 
in addition  the purchase of our product generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer 
this commitment often requires significant technical review  assessment of competitive products  and approval at a number of management levels within the customer s organization 
because of these issues  our sales cycle has ranged from two to nine months and is difficult to predict for any particular license transaction 
the cost and difficulty in implementing our product could significantly harm our reputation with customers  diminishing our ability to license additional products to our customers 
our product is often purchased as part of large projects undertaken by our customers 
these projects are complex  time consuming and expensive 
failure by customers to successfully deploy our product  or the failure by us or third party consultants to ensure customer satisfaction  could damage our reputation with existing and future customers and reduce future revenues 
in many cases  our customers must interact with  modify  or replace significant elements of their existing computer systems 
the costs of our product and services represent only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and consulting costs 
the significant involvement of third parties  including system integrators  reduces the control we have over the implementation of our product and the quality of customer service provided to organizations which license our software 
if we are not successful in continuing to develop packaged versions of our product  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
we have developed and intend to continue to develop packaged versions of our product which incorporate business processes of specific industries  including telecommunications  manufacturing  financial services and energy 
this presents technical challenges and will require collaboration with system integrators and the commitment of significant resources 
if we are not successful in developing these targeted products or these products do not achieve market acceptance  our ability to increase future revenues could be harmed 
our operating results are substantially dependent on license revenues from one product and our business could be materially harmed by factors that adversely affect the pricing and demand for our product 
since  a majority of our total revenues has been  and is expected to be  derived from the license of our businessware product 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the demand for businessware by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to businessware in performance or price  or we fail to enhance businessware and introduce new products in a timely manner  demand for our product may decline 
a decline in demand for businessware as a result of competition  technological change or other factors would significantly reduce our revenues 
if our product does not operate with the many hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our business may fail 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  packaged software applications and networking platforms 
if our product fails to gain broad market acceptance  due to its inability to support a variety of these platforms  our operating results may suffer 
our business depends  among others  on the following factors 
our ability to integrate our product with multiple platforms and existing  or legacy  systems and to modify our product as new versions of packaged applications are introduced  
the portability of our product  particularly the number of operating systems and databases that our product can source or target  
our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet standards  
the integration of additional software modules under development with our existing product  and 
our management of software being developed by third parties for our customers or use with our product 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of our product in a timely manner  our revenues may decline 
we may fail to introduce or deliver new products on a timely basis  if at all 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the commencement of commercial shipments of our businessware product 
to date  these delays have not had a material impact on our revenues 
if new releases or products are delayed or do not achieve market acceptance  we could experience a delay or loss of revenues and cause customer dissatisfaction 
in addition  customers may delay purchases of our product in anticipation of future releases 
if customers defer material orders in anticipation of new releases or new product introductions  our revenues may decline 
our product relies on third party programming tools and applications 
if we lose access to these tools and applications  or are unable to modify our product in response to changes in these tools and applications  our revenues could decline 
our programs utilize java programming technology provided by sun microsystems 
we also depend upon access to the interfaces  known as apis  used for communication between external software products and packaged application software 
our access to apis of third party applications are controlled by the providers of these applications 
if the application provider denies or delays our access to apis  our business may be harmed 
some application providers may become competitors or establish alliances with our competitors  increasing the likelihood that we would not be granted access to their apis 
we also license technology related to the connectivity of our product to third party database and other applications and we incorporate some third party technology into our product offerings 
loss of the ability to use this technology  delays in upgrades  failure of these third parties to support these technologies  or other difficulties with our third party technology partners could lead to delays in product shipment and could cause our revenues to decline 
we could suffer losses and negative publicity if new versions and releases of our product contain errors or defects 
our product and its interactions with customers software applications and it systems are complex and  accordingly  there may be undetected errors or failures when products are introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past discovered software errors in our new releases and new products after their introduction which has resulted in additional research and development expenses 
to date  these additional expenses have not been material 
we may in the future discover errors in new releases or new products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
since many customers are using our product for mission critical business operations  any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business and generate negative publicity 
our growth continues to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and if we fail to manage our growth our ability to market and sell our product and develop new products may be harmed 
we must plan and manage our growth effectively in order to offer our product and services and achieve revenue growth and profitability in a rapidly evolving market 
our growth has and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources  and we may not be able to effectively manage our growth in the future 
we continue to increase domestically the scope of our operations  and have added a number of employees 
for us to effectively manage our growth  we must continue to do the following 
install new management and information control systems  and 
expand  train and motivate our workforce 
in particular  we continue to add new software systems to complement and enhance our existing accounting  human resource and sales and marketing software systems 
if we fail to install these software systems in an efficient and timely manner  or if the new systems fail to adequately support our level of operations  then we could incur substantial additional expenses to remedy these failures 
if we do not keep pace with technological change  our product may be rendered obsolete and our operating results may suffer 
our industry is characterized by very rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
our existing product will be rendered obsolete if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that meet new customer demands  support new standards or integrate with new or upgraded versions of packaged applications 
we have also found that the technological life cycle of our product is difficult to estimate 
we believe that we must continue to enhance our current product while we concurrently develop and introduce new products that anticipate emerging technology standards and keep pace with competitive and technological developments 
failure to do so will harm our ability to compete 
as a result  we are required to continue to make substantial product development investments 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we depend on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel 
none of these persons are bound by an employment agreement 
the loss of senior management or other key research  development  sales and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
in particular dr 
jomei chang  our president and chief executive officer  and dr 
m 
dale skeen  our chief technology officer  would be difficult to replace 
in addition  we must attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
we face significant competition for individuals with the skills required to develop  market and support our products and services 
we cannot assure that we will be able to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of these highly skilled employees 
we depend on the increasing use of the internet and on the growth of electronic commerce 
if the use of the internet and electronic commerce does not grow as anticipated  our revenues could decline and our business will be seriously harmed 
we depend on the increased acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for electronic commerce and the adoption by businesses of ebusiness solutions 
rapid growth in the use of the internet is a recent occurrence 
as a result  acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of business customers may not adopt or continue to use the internet as a medium of commerce 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty  and there exist few proven services and products 
business to business electronic commerce networks  including vitria s business network  are at an early stage of development and market acceptance 
we are in the first year of offering subscriptions to the vitria business network 
the revenues associated may be a combination of license and or annual subscription fees 
our future prospects could be adversely impacted if the vitria business network is not commercially successful 
our future results may depend significantly on the use of our electronic commerce platform in independent internet marketplaces 
we have entered into agreements with licensees who are forming networks that will be powered by our business to business electronic commerce platform 
these networks have been recently formed and are at an early stage of development 
there is no guarantee regarding the level of activity of different companies in these networks  the effectiveness of the interaction among companies using our business to business electronic commerce platform and of the attractiveness of offerings of our competitors 
if these networks are not successful  our business  operating results and financial position could be affected 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  we may lose these rights and our business may be seriously harmed 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights to distinguish our product from our competitor s products 
the use by others of our proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we have no issued patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  existing laws afford only limited protection 
attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our product or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use 
furthermore  policing the unauthorized use of our product is difficult  and expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if our source code is released to our customers  our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be jeopardized and our revenues could decline 
some of our license agreements require us to place the source code for our product in escrow 
these agreements generally provide these customers with a limited  non exclusive license to use this code if 
we fail to provide the product or maintenance and support  
we cease to do business without a successor  or 
there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against vitria 
our revenues could decline and our business could be seriously harmed if customers were granted this access 
our product could infringe the intellectual property rights of others causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights 
software developers in our market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products in different software industry segments overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  prevent product shipment or cause delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our business 
patent litigation in particular has complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties 
in the event an infringement claim against us is successful and we cannot obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our product to avoid infringement  our business would be harmed 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed to us or are using confidential or proprietary information 
we may not successfully enter international markets or generate significant product revenues abroad  which could result in slower revenue growth and harm our business 
we have opened international offices in countries including the united kingdom  japan  germany  france  italy  canada  australia and the netherlands and intend to establish additional international offices 
we anticipate devoting significant resources and management attention to expanding international opportunities 
there are a number of challenges to establishing operations outside of the united states and we may be unable to successfully generate significant international revenues 
if we fail to successfully establish our products in international markets  we could experience slower revenue growth and our business could be harmed 
it may be difficult to protect our intellectual property in certain international jurisdictions 
we may not be able to efficiently integrate the operations of our acquisitions which may harm our business 
we recently announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire xmlsolutions corporation  a provider of edi and xml technology 
we may make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  technologies or market access 
if we are to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions  the operations of these companies must be integrated and combined efficiently 
customer relationships and strategic partnerships may be disrupted during the integration process which could result in lost sales and lost customers  and could harm our business 
we may also incur significant expenses during the integration process 
in addition  the dedication of management resources to integration may detract attention from our day to day business 
the successful integration of any acquisition will also depend in part on the retention of key personnel 
there can be no assurance that the integration process will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of any business integration will be fully realized 
achieving the benefits of any acquisition will depend in part on our ability to continue to successfully develop and sell our products and integrate new technologies to develop new products and product features  in a timely and efficient manner 
if we are not successful in these efforts  our business may be harmed 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenues 
we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things 
develop or enhance our products and services  
acquire technologies  products or businesses  
expand operations  in the united states or internationally  
hire  train and retain employees  or 
respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
our failure to do any of these things could result in lower revenues and could seriously harm our business we are at risk of securities class action litigation due to our expected stock price volatility 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially acute for us because technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and  as a result  have been subject to  on average  a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  and could seriously harm our business 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include 
establishment of a classified board of directors of directors requiring that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  
authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  
prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  
limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  
prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and 
establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings in addition  section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of vitria
