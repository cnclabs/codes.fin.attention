we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
overview we are a leader in the design  manufacture  marketing and support of thin film metrology systems for the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
we have made several strategic changes in our business over the past two years that have positioned us to further participate in these markets 
these changes include becoming an original equipment manufacturer  or oem  of metrology systems that are integrated into various types of semiconductor processing equipment  the development of new products that can be used for millimeter wafers and chemical mechanical planarization  an increased emphasis on product development  manufacturing and direct sales in japan and korea  a shift to direct sales from third party representatives in asia and the united states  a decision to outsource certain system components such as robotics  enabling us to leverage our technical resources  the acquisition of an overlay registration product line from optical specialties  inc in march see acquisition for more information on the product line acquisition  and the acquisition of inspection and metrology technology from phase metrics in december our business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  flat panel displays and magnetic recording heads and their suppliers 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers for our products is  in turn  dependent on the current and future market demand for semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors  disk drives and computers that utilize disk drives and flat panel displays for use in laptop computers  pagers  cell phones and a variety of other applications 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors  flat panel displays and magnetic recording heads is also an important factor in the demand for our metrology systems 
we derive our revenues from product sales and services  which include sales of accessories and service to the installed base of products 
for the year ended december   we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
revenues from product sales and replacement and spare parts are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
revenues from service work are recognized when performed 
in certain geographical regions where risk of loss and title do not transfer upon shipment  payments received are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized upon customer acceptance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our revenue recognition policy

ii acquisition on march   we purchased from optical specialties a metrology system product line and related assets used to measure the critical dimensions and overlay registration errors observed in sub micron photolithography 
under the agreement  we paid approximately million in cash for the assets and in process research and development 
the total purchase price and allocation among the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired including acquired in process research and development is summarized as follows in thousands total purchase price cash consideration  purchase price allocation tangible assets  intangible assets core and developed technology goodwill in process research and development  liabilities total purchase price allocation  intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over a five year useful life 
the purchase price allocation and intangible valuation was based on our estimates of the after tax net cash flows and gave explicit consideration to the sec s views on acquired in process research and development as set forth in its september  letter to the american institute of certified public accountants 
specifically  the valuation gave consideration to the following the employment of a fair market value premise excludes any nanometrics specific considerations  which could result in estimates of investment value for the subject assets  and comprehensive due diligence concerning all potential intangible assets including trademarks tradenames  patents  copyrights  noncompete agreements  assembled workforce and customer relationships and sales channel 
the value of core technology was specifically addressed  with a view toward ensuring the relative allocations to core technology and in process research and development were consistent with the relative contributions of each to the final product 
the allocation to in process research and development was based on a calculation that considered only the efforts completed as of the transaction date  and only the cash flow associated with these completed efforts for the products currently in process 
as indicated above  we recorded a one time charge of million in the first quarter of for acquired in process research and development related to the metra development project that had not reached technological feasibility  had no alternative future use and for which successful development was uncertain 
our conclusion that the in process development effort  or any material sub component  had no alternative future use was reached in consultation with our engineering personnel and engineering personnel from optical specialties 
the project to complete the metra product included the completion of a software platform design started by optical specialties in as of the acquisition date  the metra had yet to achieve technological feasibility since there was not a working prototype with a reliable new software design 
at the time of acquisition  the estimated cost to complete this software and related development was approximately  we began shipments of the metra product to a customer in june and it was at that time that we began to benefit from the acquired research and development related to the product 
significant assumptions used to determine the value of in process research and development included several factors  including the following ii forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the development effort using projections prepared by us  and percentage complete of for the metra project estimated by considering a number of factors  including the costs invested to date relative to total cost of the development effort and the amount of progress completed as of the acquisition date  on a technological basis  relative to the overall technological achievements required to achieve the functionality of the eventual product 
the technological issues were addressed by engineering representatives from both us and optical specialties  and when estimating the value of the technology  the projected financial results of the acquired assets were estimated on a stand alone basis without any consideration to potential synergic benefits or investment value related to the acquisition 
accordingly  separate projected cash flows were prepared for both the existing as well as the in process metra products 
these projected results were based on the number of units sold times average selling price less the associated costs 
after preparing the estimated cash flow from the product being developed  a portion of this cash flow was attributed to the core technology  which was embodied in the in process metra product line and enabled a quicker and more cost effective development of the metra when estimating the value of the developed  core and in process technologies  discount rates of  and  respectively  were used 
these discount rates considered both the status and risk associated with the respective cash flows as of the acquisition date 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million as compared to million at december  additionally  our working capital of million at december  increased from million at december  we believe our working capital  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our needs at least through the next twelve months 
we have begun construction of a new facility for our korean subsidiary and have committed approximately  in relation to this construction  of which  has been paid as of december  we have also begun construction on a new facility for our japanese subsidiary and have committed approximately  in purchase commitments relating to this construction 
operating activities during provided cash of million primarily from net income and increased accounts payable and other current liabilities offset partially by higher accounts receivable and inventory levels 
investing activities used million due to net purchases of short term investments of million and million in capital expenditures used for the purchase and improvement of our building in milpitas  california 
financing activities provided cash of million primarily from a public offering of common stock in march  the issuance of debt obligations and the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans offset by the net repayment of debt obligations 
operating activities during provided cash of million primarily from net income and changes in income taxes of million 
investing activities used million due to net purchases of short term investments of million and million in capital expenditures and prepaid licenses fees 
financing activities provided cash of  primarily due to the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans offset by the net repayment of debt obligations in japan of million 
operating activities during provided net cash of  primarily from net income partially offset by working capital requirements 
investing activities used cash of million  primarily to purchase the metra product line  as previously discussed above  and to fund net purchases of short term investments 
financing activities provided cash of  resulting primarily from the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments 
for example  as previously discussed above  in march  we purchased from optical specialties a metrology system product line and related assets 
under the agreement  we paid approximately million in cash for the assets and technology 
we funded this acquisition from our cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations 
ii new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year we have assessed the implications of adopting sfas no 
 and adoption of this statement will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain interpretations and practices followed by the division of corporation finance and the office of the chief accountant of the sec in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
application of the accounting and disclosures desired in the bulletin was required by the fourth fiscal quarter of and the effects are required to be recorded through a retroactive  cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year  with a restatement of all prior interim quarters in the year 
we implemented sab no 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in revenue recognition principle in the amount of million 
the impact of sab no 
on our revenues and costs are described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
factors that may affect future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business cyclicality in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries has led to substantial decreases in demand for our systems and may from time to time continue to do so our operating results have varied significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
the majority of our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device and capital equipment manufacturers 
these manufacturers capital expenditures  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these downturns have often resulted in substantial decreases in the demand for capital equipment  including metrology systems 
we have found that the resulting decrease in capital expenditures has typically been more pronounced than the downturn in semiconductor device industry revenues 
we expect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and therefore  our business  to continue 
currently  the semiconductor industry is suffering a downturn 
should the downturn continue  our business and results of operations could suffer 
we are highly dependent on international sales and operations  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks sales to customers in foreign countries accounted for approximately and of our total net revenues in and  respectively 
we maintain facilities in japan and korea 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our reliance on international sales and operations exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  including political  social and economic instability  ii trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  import and export license requirements and restrictions  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  disruptions in international transport or delivery  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting receivables  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize  our international sales could decrease and our foreign operations could suffer 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales in asia  our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by the instability of asian economies our sales to customers in asian markets represented approximately and of our total net revenues in and  respectively 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  korea and taiwan  each of which accounted for a significant portion of our business in that region  have experienced general economic weaknesses over the last several years 
these weaknesses began to adversely affect our sales to semiconductor manufacturers located in these regions in the third and fourth quarters of and continued through the first half of although we have received increased orders in from customers in the asia pacific region  any further instability in the asian markets could harm our sales in future periods 
our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and our revenues would significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or if they delayed or cancelled a large order historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
if any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer systems  or if a large order were delayed or cancelled  our revenues would significantly decline 
in  sales to applied materials  hyundai and tsmc accounted for  and of our total net revenues  respectively 
in  sales to applied materials and tsmc represented and of our total net revenues  respectively 
there are only a limited number of large companies operating in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
accordingly  we expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
in addition  as large semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head manufacturers and suppliers seek to establish closer relationships with their suppliers  we expect that our customer base will become even more concentrated 
the success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers 
in order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner  we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers 
our relationships with our customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding industry trends  which enables us to better plan our product development activities 
if our current relationships with our large customers are impaired  or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future  our long term ability to produce commercially successful systems will be impaired 
we depend on applied materials for sales of our integrated metrology systems  and the loss of applied materials as a customer could harm our business we believe that sales of integrated metrology systems will be an important source of future revenues 
sales of our integrated metrology ii systems depend upon applied materials selling semiconductor equipment products that include our metrology systems as components 
if applied materials is unable to sell such products  or if applied materials chooses to focus its attention on products that do not integrate our systems  our business could suffer 
we may be unable to retain applied materials as a customer 
if we lose applied materials as a customer for any reason  our ability to realize sales from integrated metrology systems would be significantly diminished  which would harm our business 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and probably will continue to vary significantly in the future  which will cause volatility in our stock price our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include changes in customer demand for our systems  economic conditions in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries  the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  competitive pressures on product prices and changes in pricing by our customers or suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and product releases by us or our competitors and our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a timely and cost effective basis  the timing of acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  the levels of our fixed expenses  including research and development costs associated with product development  relative to our revenue levels  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen 
due to the foregoing factors and other factors described in this factors that may affect future operating results section  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not view these operating results as indicators of our future performance 
if our operating results in any period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
we do not maintain any long term supply agreements with any of our suppliers 
we have entered into arrangements with ja woollam company for the purchase of the spectroscopic ellipsometer component  midac corporation for the purchase of the ftir spectrometer component  and kensington laboratories for the robotics incorporated in our advanced measurement systems 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the following we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves extremely complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by suppliers 
we believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified  if necessary  for most sole and limited source parts 
however  if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we may be forced to redesign our systems  which could prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries  or any other circumstance that would restrict our ability to ship our products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our business 
ii our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and increased competition could impair sales of our products we operate in the highly competitive semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries and face competition from a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  which could impair sales of our products 
moreover  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors 
these transactions by our competitors and potential competitors may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs 
many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries are large companies that require global support and service for their metrology systems 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues to fluctuate widely from period to period 
our customers generally take a long time to evaluate our metrology systems 
we expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems 
the length of time it takes for us to make a sale depends upon many factors  including the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives and distributors  the complexity of the customer s metrology needs  the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  the customer s budgetary constraints  and the quality and sophistication of the customer s current processing equipment 
because of the number of factors influencing the sales process  the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer  if ever  varies widely 
our sales cycles  including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order  typically range from three to six months 
sometimes our sales cycles can be much longer  particularly with customers in asia 
during these cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts 
if we do make a sale  our customers often purchase only one of our systems  and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period of time before purchasing additional systems 
the purchases are generally made by purchase orders and not long term contracts 
the number of additional products a customer purchases  if any  depends on many factors  including a customer s capacity requirements 
the period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases can vary from three months to a year or longer  and variations in the length of this period could cause fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 
relatively small fluctuations in our system costs may cause our operating results to vary significantly each quarter during any quarter  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our automated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system  our integrated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system and our tabletop metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell will cause significant changes in our operating results 
we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and therefore our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 
ii our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter and shipments from backlog 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all systems sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility of future product shipments  and our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 
because of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets  it is sometimes difficult for us to win customers from our competitors even if our metrology systems are superior to theirs we believe that once a semiconductor  flat panel display or magnetic recording head customer has selected one vendor s metrology system  the customer generally relies upon that system and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s system  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s metrology system has been installed  a customer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience downtime in order to switch to another vendor s metrology system 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s system for an application 
if we deliver systems with defects  our credibility will be harmed and the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease our systems are complex and sometimes have contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced 
if we deliver systems with errors  defects or bugs  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems would be harmed 
further  if our systems contain errors  defects or bugs  we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems 
in the event of a successful product liability claim  we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced metrology systems we will likely lose market share to our competitors we operate in an industry that is subject to technological changes  changes in customer demands and the introduction of new  higher performance systems with short product life cycles 
to be competitive  we must continually design  develop and introduce in a timely manner new metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head manufacturers and suppliers 
we must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems  and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new systems could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share 
successful infringement claims by third parties could result in substantial damages  lost product sales and the loss of important intellectual property rights by us our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
our intellectual property may infringe or be infringed upon by third parties despite our efforts to protect it  which would threaten our future success and competitive position our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families  and we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our metrology systems  and have filed applications for additional patents 
any of our pending patent applications may be rejected  and we may not in the future be able to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable 
in addition  the patents we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
third parties may also design around these patents 
ii in addition to patent protection  we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  in the event that these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies 
our confidential and proprietary information and technology might also be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties 
we may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us  or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re engineer our product or obtain expensive licenses from third parties 
we must expend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products  and if these products do not achieve commercial acceptance  our operating results may suffer we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and refine existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle that could delay introduction of these systems 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize  or orders that do materialize may be cancelled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  our operating results will suffer 
we must attract and retain key personnel with relevant industry knowledge to help support our future growth  and competition for such personnel in our industry is intense our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support  finance and manufacturing personnel 
we do not enter into employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of these key personnel  who would be extremely difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
to support our future growth  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
competition for such personnel in our industry is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
we manufacture all of our systems at a limited number of facilities  and any prolonged disruption in the operations of those facilities could reduce our revenues we produce all of our systems in our manufacturing facilities located in milpitas  california and through our subsidiaries in japan and korea 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated  costly equipment and specially designed facilities 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines 
our milpitas facility is currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power in california 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our facility 
if we cannot deliver our systems in a timely manner  due to a business interruption  our revenues will likely suffer 
if we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost effective and non disruptive manner our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to this end  from time to time we have acquired complementary businesses  products  or technologies instead of developing them ourselves and may choose to do so in the future 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisitions  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that result in dilution to our shareholders 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
ii our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states in and  and  respectively  of our total net revenues were derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  including certain countries in asia  such as taiwan  korea and japan 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in those countries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
