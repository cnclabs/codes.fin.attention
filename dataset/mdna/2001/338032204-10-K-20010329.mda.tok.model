european economic and monetary union we conduct business in many of the countries that have agreed to join the european economic and monetary union and  among other things  adopt a single currency called the euro

business enterprises have the option of switching to the single currency at any time prior to january  in connection with the upgrade of our management information systems  we incorporated the necessary changes to allow us to conduct business in euros and the national currencies during the transition period and entirely in euros thereafter

in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate manufacturing and logistical facilities as well as offices around the world and utilize fixed and floating rate debt to finance our global operations 
as a result  we are subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe the political and economic risks related to our foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which our largest foreign operations are located 
in the normal course of business  we use derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our market risks 
additional information regarding our financial instruments is contained in item financial statements and supplementary data note fair value of financial instruments and note debt 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of these changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flow associated with these changes 
our principal currency exposures are in the major european currencies and in the canadian dollar 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
we measure our market risk related to our holdings of financial instruments based on changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change in interest and currency exchange rates 
we used year end market rates on our financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis 
we do not include items such as lease contracts  insurance contracts  and obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits in the analysis 
our primary interest rate exposures relate to our cash  fixed and variable rate debt and interest rate swaps 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the net present values of our interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change in interest rates 
the potential loss in cash flows and earnings is based on the change in the net interest income expense over a one year period due to an immediate change in rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our fair values  cash flows or earnings for either or our primary currency rate exposures are to our intercompany debt  cash and foreign currency forward contracts 
the potential loss in fair values is based on an immediate change in the us dollar equivalent balances of our currency exposures due to a shift in exchange rates
