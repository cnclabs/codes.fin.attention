comparison of fiscal years ended december  and net revenues advertising e commerce revenues 
advertising and e commerce revenues increased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in page views  to million  as compared to million  resulting in higher sales of internet sponsorship  banner and e mail advertisements  partially offset by a reduction in the revenue per  page views

other revenues decreased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of the absence of a one time consulting services arrangement in april related to content syndication  and lower revenues from thestreet

general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs decreased to  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of costs associated with employee benefits and computer services being allocated to operating departments  the absence of moving costs that were incurred in as a result of moving our offices  reduced professional fees  equipment rental  and recruiting fees  partially offset by additional costs to support the growth of our business  such as occupancy costs and administrative salaries and related expenses

com  inc in december and bigfish management  inc 
in may noncash compensation expense in  and the first three months of  we granted options to purchase shares of our common stock at exercise prices that were less than the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the date of grant 
this resulted in noncash compensation expense incurred over the period that these specific options vest 
the noncash compensation expense was  for the twelve months ended december  the remaining noncash compensation expense beyond the year is currently estimated to be million 
restructuring expenses during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring expenses of  consisting of approximately million for headcount reductions  approximately million for consolidation of facilities and reduction in non performing assets  and approximately million for the extinguishments of certain marketing and technology related contracts 
these restructuring and other related charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and decreased dependence on the advertising market to create a more flexible and efficient organization 
the plan resulted in approximately a headcount reduction throughout the organization 
total cash outlay for the restructuring will be approximately million 
the remaining million of restructuring related costs consists of non cash charges including the write off of certain assets 
as of the end of fiscal  approximately million of cash was used for restructuring 
the remaining cash outlay primarily relates to consolidation and extinguishments of certain contracts  and is expected to occur over the next months

barter transactions are recognized at the fair value as determined by the comparable advertising market rates at the time of the placement

uk 
for the twelve months ended december   interest expense on loans from founders of the thestreet 
com  llc was  in may  the loans and remaining accrued interest were converted into equity when thestreet 
com  llc converted into thestreet 
com  inc for the twelve months ended december   interest income was  primarily due to interest earned on the cash proceeds from a private placement in may income taxes for the twelve months ended december   income taxes were  primarily due to state and local income tax assessments 
no benefit for federal and state income taxes is reported in the financial statements  as we had elected to be taxed as a partnership prior to may   at which time we converted to a c corporation 
subsequent to our conversion to a c corporation  we have accounted for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
had we applied the provisions of sfas for the period from inception  the deferred tax asset generated  primarily from net operating loss carryforwards  would have been offset by a full valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources we currently invest in money market funds and other short term  investment grade instruments that are highly liquid  of high quality  and have maturities of less than one year  with the intent that such funds easily be made available for operating purposes 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments amounted to  representing of our total assets 
cash used in operating activities of  for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a net loss of  offset by noncash charges and increases in restructuring reserve  deferred revenue  other current liabilities  and decreases in other receivables  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets  other assets  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash used in investing activities of  for the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of the net purchases of short term and long term investments  capital expenditures  and the purchase of a minority interest in thestreet 
com europe ltd 
capital expenditures have generally consisted of purchases of computer hardware related to increasing our capacity and enhancing our web sites 
cash provided by financing activities of  for the twelve months ended december  was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
strategic relationships  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to provide rights to certain of our content 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes  and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings  material changes in fair values or cash flows for all instruments 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are all the material risks facing thestreet 
com 
we may also face some non material risks which we have not discussed in the following description of our risk factors 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have a history of losses  and although we have diversified our sources of revenue  potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results make financial forecasting difficult as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses in we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and  as a result  will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability  which may not occur 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
as part of our strategy to diversify our sources of revenue  since january we have expanded our offerings by relaunching our formerly subscription based thestreet 
com web site as a completely free  advertising supported web site  launching a new subscription based site called realmoney 
com  acquiring an email newsletter publisher and a conference company  introducing our first investing book  thestreet 
com guide to smart investing in the internet era  published by the doubleday division of random house inc  and introducing a daily institutional fax product 
we have developed a loyal audience of investors at various experience levels who turn to our product offerings for all their financial and investing information needs 
in addition  we have important strategic relationships with leading companies in the media  technology and financial services sectors that also help us create brand awareness and increase subscription and advertising revenues 
our goal is to monetize and leverage our financial content across a variety of platforms 
however  we cannot assure you that these and other initiatives will result in increases in revenues sufficient to enable us to achieve profitability 
in such an event  the price of our common stock is likely to decrease 
we recently announced our goal of becoming ebitda positive by the end of however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve this goal 
ebitda  defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization is one of the primary measures we use to evaluate performance 
we believe that ebitda is an appropriate measure of evaluating our operations 
however  ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  operating income  net earnings  cash flows  and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
we believe that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
similar seasonal patterns are developing in our industry 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance  nor would our operating results for any particular quarter be indicative of future operating results 
in some future quarters our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such an event  the price of our common stock is likely to decrease 
we may have difficulty selling our advertising inventory  a significant portion of which is concentrated among our top advertisers the market for online advertising sales has significantly softened in the last few months 
both traditional and new media advertisers are scaling back their online media budgets 
in addition  seasonal fluctuations in the markets for consumer products cause advertisers to generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
as a result  many advertising supported web sites are experiencing difficulty selling their available inventories and maintaining their rate structures 
although we believe that our network of sites and corresponding demographic profiles will continue to enable us to maintain our high sell through  we expect that our overall advertising rates will decrease as a result of increased inventory 
additionally  we have entered into headline indexing and content distribution agreements with a variety of internet portals and content providers to distribute our news and headlines to their users  thus driving potential readers to our web sites 
we believe that these arrangements will continue to provide a cost effective way to increase our unique visitors and page view inventory 
however  our actual traffic is subject to a variety of factors  including seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage that generally cause weakness in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  technical difficulties associated with the implementation and ongoing delivery of the news distribution arrangements  and editorial policy changes by our partners 
if we are unable to attract significantly increased traffic and advertising revenues under this strategy  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  our top five advertisers accounted for approximately of our total advertising revenues 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of a number of our top advertisers  and such a loss could be concentrated in a single quarter 
further  if we do not continue to increase our revenue from financial services advertisers or attract advertisers from non financial industries  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as is typical in the advertising industry  our advertising contracts have cancellation provisions 
we may have difficulty retaining current subscribers we continue to seek to retain our current subscribers and to attract new subscribers 
as of december   we had approximately  paid subscribers  including both retail and corporate  down from approximately  when we launched our free site 
we believe we have significantly enhanced our subscription offerings to differentiate them from the free financial news web sites that are widely available on the web  including on our own free site 
however  given the availability of such free financial information  we may not be able to retain our current subscribers and attract additional subscribers in a cost effective manner 
if our subscription base declines more than we anticipate or our cost of subscriber acquisition increases  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties in developing new and enhanced products and services could harm our business we intend to introduce additional and enhanced products and services in order to retain our current readers and attract new readers 
if we introduce a product or service that is not favorably received  our current readers may choose a competitive service over ours 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from introducing new products and services  or the new products or services we introduce could contain errors that are discovered after they are introduced 
in some cases  we are dependent on third parties  including software companies  application service providers and technology consulting firms  to help us develop and implement new products and services 
if these third parties are not able to fulfill their responsibilities to us on schedule or if the technology developed by them for our use does not function as anticipated  implementation may be delayed and the cost of implementation may be higher than anticipated 
such developments could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
unforeseen development difficulties may hinder our efforts we have significantly enhanced our design and our technological infrastructure to further improve our sites and to accommodate the expected increase in traffic  and intend to continue such development activities 
however  unforeseen development difficulties could prevent us from implementing such improvements or cause the costs to implement such improvements  including design  technology and related costs  to be higher than anticipated 
in the past  we have experienced significant spikes in traffic on our web sites when there have been important financial news events 
in addition  the number of our readers has continued to increase over time and we expect our reader base to increase over time since our main site has been converted to a totally free site 
accordingly  our web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic  often at unexpected times 
although we have upgraded and continue to upgrade our systems  our web sites have in the past  and may in the future  experience publishing problems  slower response times than usual or other problems for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences could cause our readers to perceive our web sites as not functioning properly and  therefore  cause them to use other methods to obtain their financial news and information 
in such a case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we face a risk of system failure that may result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to our reputation our ability to provide timely information and continuous news updates depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems 
similarly  our ability to track  measure and report the delivery of advertisements on our site depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
in february  our internet hosting agreement with exodus communications  inc was renewed  and we currently continue to maintain all of our production servers at exodus s new jersey data center 
our operations depend on the ability of exodus to protect its own systems and our systems in its data center against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failure  vandalism and similar unexpected adverse events 
although exodus provides comprehensive facilities management services  including human and technical monitoring of all production servers hours per day  seven days per week  exodus does not guarantee that our internet access will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
any disruption in the internet access to our web sites provided by exodus could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our own internal systems and operations  as well as those of exodus  may be subject to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  fire  water damage  power loss  telecommunication failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our service or a decrease in responsiveness of our web sites could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to our reputation  brand and our relations with our advertisers and e commerce partners 
like most web sites  we may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and other deliberate attempts to disrupt our technological operations  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
in addition  unauthorized persons may improperly access our data 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur because of any failures in our system or interruptions in our delivery of content 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any event  damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel  including executives  editors  writers  and technology personnel 
only a few of our key employees are bound by employment or non competition agreements 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel  or our inability to attract replacements with appropriate expertise  could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance a number of financial news and information sources compete for consumers and advertisers attention and spending 
we compete for advertisers  readers  staff and outside contributors with many types of companies  including online services or web sites focused on business  finance and investing  such as cbs 
marketwatch 
com  cnbc 
com  cnnfn 
com  the wall street journal interactive edition  the new york times on the web  dowjones 
com  smartmoney 
com  microsoft msn moneycentral and the motley fool  publishers and distributors of traditional media  including print  radio and television  such as the wall street journal  fortune  bloomberg business radio and cnbc  providers of terminal based financial news and data  such as bloomberg business news  reuters news service  dow jones markets and bridge news service  web portal companies  such as yahoo and america online  and online brokerage firms  many of which provide financial and investment news and information  such as charles schwab  e trade and merrill lynch 
our ability to compete depends on many factors  including the originality  timeliness  insightfulness and trustworthiness of our content and that of our competitors  the ease of use of services developed either by us or our competitors and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their services 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies including offering more of their financial news and commentary for free and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees  outside contributors  strategic partners and advertisers 
our competitors may develop content that is equal or superior to ours or that achieves greater market acceptance than ours 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully for advertisers  readers  staff or outside contributors  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we also compete with other web sites  television  radio and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the internet or our web sites to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or to advertising on our web sites 
a failure to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other companies could decrease our subscriber and reader base  which may harm our business we depend on establishing and maintaining content syndication and headline indexing relationships with high traffic web sites for a significant portion of our current subscriber and reader base 
there is intense competition for relationships with these firms and placement on these sites  and we may have to pay significant fees to establish additional content syndication and headline indexing relationships or maintain existing relationships in the future 
we may be unable to enter into or successfully renew relationships with these firms or sites on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
these relationships may not attract significant numbers of subscribers or readers 
many companies that we may approach for a strategic relationship or who already have strategic relationships with us also provide financial news and information from other sources 
as a result  these companies may be reluctant to enter into or maintain strategic relationships with us 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we do not establish additional  and maintain existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if any of our strategic relationships do not result in an increase in the number of subscribers or readers of our web sites 
we may be unable to grow through acquisitions and integrate future acquisitions into our business we intend to pursue a growth strategy that may involve acquisitions of other companies 
however  we may be unable to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  the pursuit and integration of acquisitions will require substantial attention from our senior management  which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to our existing operations 
there can be no assurance that we can successfully integrate these acquisitions into our business or implement our plans without delay or substantial cost 
in addition  future acquisitions by us could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations 
any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate growth may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any failure of our internal security measures or breach of our privacy protections could cause us to lose users and subject us to liability users who subscribe to one of our subscription based web sites are required to furnish certain personal information including name  email address and credit card information  which we use to administer our services 
although we no longer need credit card information to process subscription payments for our main site now that it has converted to a free site  we continue to gather credit card information for the subscription based sites in our network 
additionally  we recently implemented a registration system that will collect certain information although not payment information from users of our free main site who wish to gain access to certain features of our site 
if the security measures that we use to protect personal information are ineffective  we may lose users and our business may be harmed 
additionally  we rely on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real time credit card authorization and verification 
we cannot predict whether technological developments or human error could allow these security measures to be circumvented 
we may need to use significant resources to prevent security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any security breaches 
if we are not able to prevent all security breaches  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our users depend on us to keep their personal information private and to not disclose it to third parties 
we therefore maintain a privacy policy  under which  with certain limited exceptions  we will not disclose to any third parties any personal information about our subscribers or other users 
we have retained the ability to modify the privacy policy at any time 
if our users perceive that we are not protecting their privacy  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties associated with our brand development may harm our ability to attract subscribers and readers we believe that maintaining and growing awareness about the thestreet 
com brand is an important aspect of our efforts to continue to attract users 
the importance of brand recognition will increase in the future because of the growing number of web sites providing financial news and information 
the new site that we have introduced  realmoney 
com  and those that we have acquired  do not have widely recognized brands  and we will need to increase awareness of these brands among potential users 
although our efforts to build brand awareness have been successful to date  they may not be cost effective or successful in the future in reaching potential users  and some potential users may not be receptive to our advertising campaign or other efforts 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of thestreet 
com brand or in persuading potential users to visit our sites 
failure to maintain our reputation for trustworthiness may reduce the number of our readers  which may harm our business it is very important that we maintain our reputation as a trustworthy news organization 
the occurrence of events  including our misreporting a news story or the non disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of our writers in breach of our compliance policy  could harm our reputation for trustworthiness 
these events could result in a significant reduction in the number of our readers  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability for information displayed on our web sites may require us to defend against legal claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures we may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information we publish on our web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web sites through links to other web sites 
we have stock ticker based message boards that allow users to post comments about individual stocks 
we undertake no obligation to moderate these message boards  and potential liability for providers of message board services has not yet been well established 
we may choose to allow our editorial staffers or outside contributors to post on our boards  thus increasing our potential liability 
our insurance may not adequately protect us against these claims 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our brand building efforts and ability to compete effectively to protect our rights to our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  clients  strategic partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  our intellectual property rights 
we have registered our trademarks in the united states and we have pending us and foreign applications for other trademarks 
effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our services 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand  devalue our proprietary content and affect our ability to compete effectively 
further  defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may have to defend against intellectual property infringement claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures although we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against us or claims that we have violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
we incorporate licensed third party technology in some of our services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have generally agreed to defend  indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect us from infringement claims 
any infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on our part  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to maintain and increase our readership depends on the continued growth in use and efficient operation of the web the web based information market is new and rapidly evolving 
our business would be materially adversely affected if web usage does not continue to grow or grows slowly 
web usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as inadequate network infrastructure  security and privacy concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed access to the internet 
our readers depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to our web sites 
many of these services have experienced significant service outages in the past and could experience service outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems 
these occurrences could cause our readers to perceive the web in general or our web sites in particular as an unreliable medium and  therefore  cause them to use other media to obtain their financial news and information 
we also depend on a number of information providers to deliver information and data feeds to us on a timely basis 
our web sites could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a general decline in online advertising could harm our business our future success is highly dependent on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
the internet advertising industry is new and rapidly evolving  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness 
as a result  demand and market acceptance for internet advertising solutions is uncertain and its growth in recent months has slowed significantly 
most of our current or potential advertising customers have little or no experience using the internet for advertising purposes and they have allocated only a limited portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
these customers may find internet advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional advertising media 
in addition  most of our current and potential web publisher customers have little experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space on their web sites 
we cannot assure you that current or potential advertising customers will continue to allocate a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or that the demand for internet advertising will continue to develop to sufficiently support internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
if the demand for internet advertising develops more slowly than we expect  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
no standards have been widely accepted to measure the effectiveness of web advertising 
if standards do not develop  existing advertisers may not continue or increase their levels of web advertising 
if standards develop and we are unable to meet these standards  advertisers may not continue advertising on our site 
furthermore  advertisers that have traditionally relied upon other advertising media may be reluctant to advertise on the web 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the market for web advertising declines or develops more slowly than expected 
different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the web 
it is difficult to predict which  if any  will emerge as the industry standard 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to project our future advertising rates and revenues 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful under alternative pricing models that may emerge 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a web user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could materially adversely affect the commercial viability of web advertising  which could materially adversely affect our advertising revenues 
in addition  some internet commentators  privacy advocates and federal and state officials have recently suggested that legislation may be needed to better safeguard online privacy  by the limitation or elimination of the use of cookies or by other methods 
if such legislation is passed  it is likely to restrict the ability of online advertisers to target their ads  which may result in a decrease in online advertising rates or online advertising spending generally 
such a decrease could materially adversely affect our advertising revenues 
we also derive advertising revenues from email services  which exposes us to potential liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  privacy violations or interruptions or delays in email service 
any allegation of impropriety or any successful claim could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with other web sites  television  radio and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the web in general or our web sites in particular to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to online advertising or to advertising on our web sites 
government regulation and legal uncertainties relating to the web could increase our costs of transmitting data and increase our legal and regulatory expenditures and could decrease our readership existing domestic and international laws or regulations and private industry guidelines specifically regulate communications or commerce on the web 
further  laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation of e commerce transactions and the characteristics and quality of online products and services are under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies and by private industry groups 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online services providers in a manner similar to the regulation of long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on such companies 
the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
these regulations  if imposed  could increase the cost of transmitting data over the web 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
the interpretation and application of existing securities laws to web based financial news providers  including laws governing investment advisors  investment companies and broker dealers  by the securities and exchange commission and state securities regulators  is a developing area 
if  as this area matures  our activity is interpreted as subjecting us to regulation  we could be subject to liability  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws which limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
although our compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on us  governments  trade associations and industry self regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws  regulations and guidelines  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  for us and our clients 
the us federal and various state governments have been investigating certain internet companies regarding their use of personal information and have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations that may result in limits on the collection and use of certain information from users in europe 
we could incur additional expenses if any new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if these agencies chose to investigate our privacy practices 
also  as a consequence of governmental legislation or regulation or enforcement efforts or evolving standards of fair information collection practices  we may be required to make changes to our products or services in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of the product or service or its attractiveness to potential customers  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
any new laws or regulations relating to the web  or certain application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the growth in the use of the web  decrease the demand for our web sites or otherwise materially adversely affect our business 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the us congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  libel  obscenity and personal privacy apply to the internet and internet advertising 
concerns about web security could reduce our advertising revenues  decrease our reader base and increase our web security expenditures concern about the transmission of confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications over the web 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter more people from using the web or from using it to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  such as signing up for a paid subscription  executing stock trades or purchasing goods or services 
because many of our advertisers seek to advertise on our web sites to encourage people to use the web to purchase goods or services  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if internet users significantly reduce their use of the web because of security concerns 
we may also incur significant costs to protect ourselves against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
control by principal stockholders  officers and directors could adversely affect our stockholders our officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  acting together  have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and to control our management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
volatility of our stock price could adversely affect our stockholders the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies  particularly internet related companies  have been highly volatile 
the trading price of our stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
from january  through december   the closing sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from to 
as of march   the closing sale price was 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we do not intend to pay dividends we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future
