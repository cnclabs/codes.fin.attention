 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 an amendment to sfas no 
 deferring the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   and cannot be applied retroactively 
management has determined that there will be no impact upon the adoption of sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
could increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income depending on future derivative instruments which may be obtained by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of the company s market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and credit risks 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term and long term debt obligations and to the company s investments 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  government securities  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities  when acquired  of days or less 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
the company constantly evaluates its invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s short term and long term debt obligations totaled million as of december  and the company had million available under its credit facilities 
the debt obligations consist of notes payable to former shareholders of acquired corporations  which are at a fixed rate of interest  and extend through november the interest rate risk on these obligations is thus immaterial due to the dollar amount of these obligations 
the interest rate on the credit facilities is variable and at a margin of to basis points above a base rate as defined by the applicable credit facility 
foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate changes impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the company generated approximately of its fiscal consolidated revenues from international operations  approximately of which were from the united kingdom 
the exchange rate has decreased approximately in fiscal  from at december  to at december  the exchange rate fluctuation has not historically had a material impact on the company s results of operations  however  if the british pound sterling continues to weaken  exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
the company did not hold or enter into any foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  factors which may impact future results and financial condition effect of fluctuations in the general economy demand for the company s professional business services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity in the markets served by the company 
during periods of slowing economic activity  companies may reduce the use of outside consultants and staff augmentation services prior to undertaking layoffs of full time employees 
also during such periods  companies may elect to defer installation of new it systems and platforms such as enterprise resource planning systems or upgrades to existing systems and platforms 
as a result  any significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company may also be adversely effected by consolidations through mergers and otherwise of main customers or between major customers with non customers 
these consolidations as well as corporate downsizings may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by such customers for the company s services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
competition the company s industry is intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
the company faces significant competition in the markets that it serves and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market in which the company operates  it competes for both clients and qualified professionals with other firms offering similar services 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment and higher wage costs  which puts pressure on gross margins 
ability to recruit and retain professional employees the company depends on its ability to recruit and retain employees who possess the skills  experience and or professional certifications necessary to meet the requirements of the company s clients 
competition for individuals possessing the requisite criteria is intense  particularly in certain specialized it and professional skill areas 
the company often competes with its own clients in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will be available and recruited in sufficient numbers on economic terms acceptable to the company 
ability to continue acquisition strategy  ability to integrate acquired operations the company has experienced significant growth in the past through acquisitions 
although the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acquisitions on economic terms acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and integrate all acquired operations into the company 
possible changes in governmental regulations from time to time  legislation is proposed in the united states congress  state legislative bodies and by foreign governments that would have the effect of requiring employers to provide the same or similar employee benefits to consultants and other temporary personnel as those provided to full time employees 
the enactment of such legislation would eliminate one of the key economic reasons for outsourcing certain human resources and could significantly adversely impact the company s staff augmentation business 
in addition  the company s costs could increase as a result of future laws or regulations that address insurance  benefits or other employment related matters 
there can be no assurance that the company could successfully pass any such increased costs to its clients
