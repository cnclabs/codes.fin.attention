item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as note  segment reporting  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
significant and developments gathering  processing and marketing during  the two phased expansion of the company s appalachian infrastructure continued 
phase i expansion was completed in february and phase ii is in progress for completion expected by mid phase i expansion added a new mmcfd  mechanical refrigeration  ngl extraction plant maytown in southern kentucky and nearly doubled the capacity  from  gallons per day to  gallons per day  of the company s fractionator siloam in northern kentucky 
revenues to be derived from the expansion are primarily fee and percent of proceeds based  which differ from markwest s historical commodity based contracts 
finally  markwest acquired a mile ngl pipeline in west virginia 
this pipeline  together with markwest s existing pipeline and a pipeline leased in  forms a continuous mile pipeline network through the southern portion of the appalachia basin 
the pipeline connects markwest s new maytown gas plant to markwest s siloam fractionator and significantly reduces feedstock transportation costs from another of markwest s gas plants boldman 
markwest s kenova gas plant was already connected to the pipeline 
on february   markwest assumed operation of the company owned boldman extraction plant from columbia gas transmission corporation columbia 
boldman is located in kentucky 
in march  markwest acquired the cobb  west virginia  natural gas liquids ngls extraction plant from columbia 
ngls extracted at boldman and cobb have been and will continue to be fractionated into propane  butane and other liquids at the company s siloam plant 
phase ii involves construction of the kermit dewpoint control plant and expanding markwest s kenova ngl extraction plant  increasing markwest s total production to  gallons per day 
phase ii started construction in october and is targeted for completion and startup in mid capital spending for the phase i and ii expansions is estimated at million and million  respectively 
to keep pace with the growing appalachia ngl production  markwest has been adding to its marketing infrastructure additional terminals  tank railcars  pressurized trailers and new and larger loading facilities 
over the period  markwest is investing million in additional marketing assets 
in march  markwest opened a new propane terminal at lordstown  ohio 
lordstown is located about truck miles northeast of markwest s siloam fractionation plant and accesses new retail markets 
in september  markwest leased additional railcars 
in may  markwest entered into a two year marketing agreement with a propane retailer for an exclusive supply agreement for their propane requirements for retail bulk plants in ohio and kentucky 
markwest is also leasing additional propane storage space 
the agreement will involve about million gallons per year of propane sales  primarily from markwest s siloam fractionation facilities 
markwest also bought twelve pressurized tank trailers to serve this supply arrangement 
although the company s favorable year financial performance met company objectives  events since december have proved to be more challenging 
futures prices for natural gas have risen dramatically  and prices for ngls have stayed essentially flat 
a large portion  about percent  of markwest s processing services for gas producers in appalachia involves extracting ngls from inlet gas streams and replacing the equivalent heat content with dry natural gas purchased in the spot or forward markets 
this part of the company s operating margin depends on a positive spread between ngl prices and natural gas costs 
effective february   the company provided producers with an alternative processing contract that provides for additional compensation to the company when processing margins are low and reduced compensation when processing margins are high 
to date  about producers accounting for a minority share of the volume out of approximately have agreed to the new contract 
if producers elect to remain with the existing contract  the company has stated that it will return the replacement natural gas at a later date  as it believes is permitted under the existing contract  such that markwest can earn a reasonable fee for its services 
this is not an isolated situation with markwest nationwide  producers and processors are renegotiating their processing agreements due to the relatively high cost of natural gas 
these new arrangements provide producers the capacity necessary to support their increasing production

exploration and production in the third quarter of  the au gres field in eastern michigan began producing from an initial well after completion of necessary surface facilities 
by year end  the well was producing  mcf per day  with reserves estimated at nearly billion cubic feet bcf 
the next well is expected to be completed late first quarter  with further expansions possible in late the company s interest is percent until payout  reverting to percent  with an option to acquire an additional percent 
in january  markwest acquired additional natural gas production properties and gathering systems in new mexico s san juan basin for million 
the properties cover  acres and producing gas wells containing bcf of proved developed reserves and bcf of proved  undeveloped reserves  net to markwest 
the purchase also includes miles of gathering pipelines 
markwest is the operator of both the production and gathering systems  with initial production of  thousand cubic feet per day mcfd net to markwest 
corporate in may  markwest began trading under a new ticker symbol mwp on the american stock exchange 
in june  markwest expanded its credit facility from  to  added a third bank and extended its term by one year to december  this larger credit facility gives the company greater financial flexibility to make acquisitions and develop new projects in the growing natural gas industry 
gathering  processing and marketing appalachia the company owns and operates in appalachia five gas processing facilities  one fractionation plant  an ngl pipeline and three propane terminals

cobb was acquired march  cobb was originally placed in service in and its extracted ngls have historically been fractionated at siloam 
maytown was placed into service in february maytown can be expanded to  mcfd for a modest amount of capital 
includes fractionation of ngls extracted at kenova  boldman  cobb and maytown listed above 
a portion of the pipeline is leased from a third party 
the company s appalachian operations are in the midst of a sizable expansion  growing production from  gallons per day in to  gallons per day by mid production for was  gallons per day 
see significant and developments earlier in this section for further information 
the company believes this region has favorable supply and demand characteristics 
appalachia is geographically situated between the tet pipeline to the north and the dixie pipeline to the south 
the historical demand for ngl products in appalachia has exceeded local production and the capacity of these two lines during peak winter periods 
this factor has enabled ngl suppliers in appalachia principally markwest  marathon ashland petroleum llc and cng transmission corporation to price their products particularly propane at a premium to gulf coast spot prices  especially during winter high demand periods 
there are approximately  wells behind the company s ngl extraction plants in appalachia  with a potential for producers to drill up to another  to  infill wells 
typical wells in this area have long lived reserves and modest decline rates 
this producing basin is one of the country s oldest  but is still one of the most prolific 
the growth in production drilling can be attributed to the recently higher gas prices in an area close to the high demand northeast us  improved drilling technologies  and cost reductions  all of which add up to improved economic returns for producers 
the kenova  boldman  cobb  maytown and kermit plants extract liquids from natural gas for further separation at the company s siloam fractionator 
all of the ngls recovered at the kenova  maytown and boldman plants beginning february  boldman ngls are transported to maytown via tanker trucks are sent to siloam via pipeline 
cobb and kermit liquids are transported to siloam via tanker trucks 
at the company s siloam fractionation plant  extracted ngls are separated into ngl products  including propane  isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline 
in addition to processing and ngl marketing  the company engages in terminaling and storage of ngls in a number of ngl storage complexes in the central and eastern united states and owns and operates propane terminals in virginia  tennessee and ohio 
markwest has contracted with producers for the exclusive right to process the producers hydrocarbon rich gas currently delivered into producer owned and columbia owned transmission pipelines upstream of the company s plants under long term contracts 
markwest also has long term operating agreements with columbia 
the company currently processes natural gas under contracts containing both keep whole and fee components 
in keep whole arrangements  the company s principal cost is the reimbursement to the natural gas producers for the btus extracted from the gas stream in the form of liquids or consumed as fuel during processing 
in such cases  the company creates operating margins by maximizing the value of the ngls extracted from the natural gas stream and minimizing the cost of replacement btus 
while the company maintains programs to minimize the cost to deliver the replacement btus to the natural gas supplier  the company s margins under keep whole contracts can be negatively affected by either decreases in ngl prices or increases in prices of replacement natural gas see significant and developments above and item legal proceedings 
processing contracts with producers also contain a fee component under which the producers pay markwest a fee to process their gas and provide a portion of their gas for fuel 
the fee may be a per unit of throughput charge or a percentage of the resulting ngl sales percent of proceeds or some combination of both 
substantially all of the company s fractionation services in appalachia historically have been provided under keep whole contracts 
the contract for processing services at the new maytown plant contains fee and percent of proceeds components 
the company attempts to maximize the value of its ngl output by marketing directly to distributors  resellers  blenders  refiners and petrochemical companies 
the company minimizes the use of third party brokers and instead supports a direct marketing staff focused on multistate and independent dealers 
additionally  the company uses its own trailer and railcar fleet  as well as its own terminals and owned and leased storage facilities  to enhance supply reliability to its customers 
all of these efforts have allowed the company to maintain premium pricing for the majority of its ngl products compared to gulf coast spot prices 
the company s sales of ngls are based on spot prices at the time the ngls are sold or are hedged 
spot market prices are based upon prices and volumes negotiated for short terms  typically days 
as market conditions permit  the company has increased its hedging activities as described in note  commodity price risk management  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
historically  the majority of the company s operating income has been derived from gathering  processing and marketing services in appalachia 
revenues from the sale of appalachian ngls represented percent  percent  and percent of gathering  processing and marketing revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  the company started a natural gas marketing group to provide  primarily in appalachia  more services to natural gas producers  source new gas for the company s facilities  minimize its replacement btu cost  and assist with its business development efforts 
the company s natural gas marketing activities are fundamentally high volume  low margin transactions executed in support of markwest s processing business 
consequently  an increasing percentage of the company s overall revenues stem from gas marketing 
for the years ended december    and  percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of gathering  processing and marketing revenue stemmed from gas marketing 
michigan certain information concerning the company s michigan assets is summarized in the following table for the year ended year december  acquired or placed throughput gas ngl production into capacity throughput throughput facilities location service mcfd mcfd gal year mile sour gas gathering manistee  mason and   n a pipeline oceana counties  mi fisk gas plant manistee county  mi    extended from miles in to miles in and miles in the company s operations in western michigan consist of a pipeline and processing plant 
the company s gas gathering pipeline gathers and transports sour gas to a treatment plant  used to remove sulfur  owned and operated by a third party 
markwest s fisk processing plant is located adjacent to the third party s treating plant 
the fisk plant processes all of the natural gas gathered by the pipeline and treated by the third party s treating plant  producing propane and other liquid products 
the plant also conditions the residue gas such that it can be sold directly into the michigan consolidated gas company dry distribution system serving western michigan 
the company currently processes natural gas in western michigan under contracts containing both fee and percent of proceeds components 
the processing contracts with producers contain a fee component under which the producers pay markwest a fee to transport and treat their gas 
under the percent of proceeds component  the company retains a portion of the ngls as compensation for the processing services provided 
operating revenues earned by the company under percent of proceeds contracts increase proportionately with the price of ngls sold 
the company generally sells its propane production as soon as it is produced 
the company s butane natural gasoline production is transported across the state via tanker trucks to the marysville fractionator  where it is separated into ngl products  including isobutane  normal butane and natural gasoline 
throughput volumes in western michigan for were  mcfd  down percent compared to volumes 
new drilling is critical to maintaining and increasing volumes 
drilling activity in the next few years will determine the sustainable production level for the project 
markwest s own exploration efforts in  along with partners  resulted in dry holes 
markwest s net interest in these wells averaged percent 
however  litigation surrounding a third party shut in well is nearly settled  which is expected to allow for connection to markwest s system in the first or second quarter another large producer well is expected to be on stream in the fourth quarter 
last year volumes averaged  mcfd 
in  average volumes are expected to be flat  although volumes are expected to ramp up near year end to  mcfd 
markwest has exclusive gathering  treatment and processing agreements with certain producers 
expected natural gas streams dedicated under these agreements will primarily be produced from an extension of the northern niagaran reef trend in western michigan 
to date  over trillion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas has been produced from the northern niagaran reef trend 
substantially all of the natural gas produced from the western region of this trend  however  is sour 
in the past  while several successful large wells were developed in the region  the natural gas producers lacked adequate gathering and treatment facilities for sour gas  and development of the trend stopped in northern manistee county 
however  with the company s expanded infrastructure of the sour gas pipeline  treatment and processing facilities and increased capacity  the company believes there could continue to be increased development in the region 
in addition  the company believes that improvements in seismic technology may increase exploration and production efforts  as well as drilling success rates 
exploration and production reserves cawley  gillespie associates  inc  an independent reservoir engineer  has reviewed markwest s estimates of proved reserves  projected future production and estimated future net revenues from production of proved reserves 
the estimates were based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data provided by or available to the company 
proved reserves at year end were bcf of natural gas compared to bcf at year end the sec pre tax net present value of the proved reserves at year end  discounted at percent  was million compared to million reported at year end reserve values were calculated according to sec guidelines based on constant prices and costs using year end nymex henry hub spot market index of per mmbtu adjusted to el paso san juan index of per mcf for and per mmbtu and per mcf  respectively for  adjusted for price hedges 
as a sensitivity analysis markwest also evaluated its reserves based on an assumed el paso san juan index price of per mcf  with prices and costs held constant 
in this analysis  the pre tax net present value of the reserves would have been approximately million 
reserve additions from all sources during excluding production and sales amounted to million bcf 
to accomplish uniformity in the reporting of reserves for comparison purposes  the sec requires that the pre tax pv of future net revenues be calculated using a spot year end pricing and costs  with no future escalation of these factors 
because these assumptions are not intended to be predictions of future commodity prices or costs  the calculated values are not intended to be indicative of the market value of these assets 
the alternative analysis of the pre tax pv of future net revenues is presented above for comparative purposes only  and is not intended to represent the company s estimate of future prices or the market value of these assets 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the company s control 
the reserve data presented represents only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas that cannot be measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
estimates made by different engineers often vary from one another 
additionally  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of any estimate may justify revision of the estimate  either upward or downward  and such revision may be material 
accordingly  reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of gas reserves and the present value of those reserves are based upon certain assumptions  including prices  future production levels and cost  that may not prove correct over time

rocky mountains markwest has focused its exploration and production business in rocky mountain coal seam natural gas development primarily in the san juan basin 
in  nearly million was spent  primarily in the fourth quarter  on high return workover activities on company properties to improve production 
during the second quarter   markwest sold its interest in a non core property for  net natural gas sold for the year averaged  mcfd  up percent over the prior year 
this increase reflects the benefit from higher production and the benefit realized from the capital program 
in january  the acquisition of additional coal bed methane properties and gathering systems in new mexico s san juan basin added another  mcfd of production 
this acquisition along with our capital expenditure program of million  is expected to increase our year end production exit rate to more than  mcfd 
michigan in eastern michigan  the company contracted with a producer to provide gas processing services for a long dormant sour gas formation 
markwest also has a percent working interest in the field 
in the first phase of the project  completed in third quarter  markwest has successfully recompleted the sims well  constructed a well facility  modified an existing gas plant and constructed a pipeline to bring an existing well into production from this formation 
this well is producing  mcfd 
the second phase of the project is expected to begin in and will involve bringing another three to four wells into production and constructing additional processing facilities 
prior to the sims  these wells have never produced from this formation due to the lack of infrastructure 
initial results look positive and could lead to significant additional investment in the project 
management believes the project has the potential to grow into a significant contributor to markwest 
seasonality a substantial portion of the company s revenues and  as a result  its gross margins  remains dependent upon the sales price of ngls  particularly propane  which fluctuates with the winter weather conditions  and other supply and demand determinants 
the strongest demand for propane and the highest propane sales margins generally occur during the winter heating season 
as a result  the company recognizes a substantial portion of its annual income during the first and fourth quarters of the year 
specifically  this seasonality occurs in the company s gathering  processing and marketing segment 
competition the company faces competition in obtaining natural gas supplies for its processing and related services operations  in obtaining unprocessed ngls for fractionation  and in marketing its products and services 
competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants  operating efficiency and reliability  and ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered 
competitive factors affecting the company s fractionation services include availability of capacity  proximity to supply and to industry marketing centers  and cost efficiency and reliability of service 
competition for customers is based primarily on price  delivery capabilities  flexibility  and maintenance of quality customer relationships 
the company s principal competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies  major interstate pipeline companies  national and local gas gatherers  ngl processing companies  brokers  marketers and distributors of varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
many of the company s competitors  such as major oil and gas and pipeline companies  have capital resources and control supplies of natural gas substantially greater than that of the company 
smaller local distributors may enjoy a marketing advantage in their immediate service areas 
drilling activity behind the company s systems varies with industry conditions  commodity prices  and effectively competes for capital with producers other drilling opportunities 
in the exploration and production segment  the company faces competition in the acquisition of leases and producing properties 
competition comes in the form of other companies with existing operations in the company s areas of focus as well as those companies wishing to buy properties as an entry strategy into such areas 
competitors range in size from small independent operators to large integrated oil companies 
the company believes it enjoys certain competitive advantages by virtue of its area knowledge and existing field operating infrastructure  making it a logical buyer for certain properties 
operational risks and insurance the company s operations are subject to the usual hazards incident to the exploration for and production  gathering  transmission  processing and storage of natural gas and ngls  such as explosions  product spills  leaks  emissions and fires 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  and pollution or other environmental damage  and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations at the affected facility 
the company maintains general public liability  property and business interruption insurance in amounts that it considers to be adequate for such risks 
such insurance is subject to deductibles that the company considers reasonable and not excessive 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  the company s insurance policies provide coverage for losses or liabilities related to sudden occurrences of pollution or other environmental damage 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against  and or the failure of a party to meet its indemnification obligations  could materially and adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
moreover  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable 
to date  however  the company has experienced no material uninsured losses or any difficulty in acquiring insurance coverage in amounts it believes to be adequate 
government regulation in the michigan area of the gathering  processing and marketing segment  the company owns and operates a gathering pipeline in conjunction with its processing plant 
under the natural gas act of  facilities that have as their primary function the performance of gathering activities and are not owned by interstate gas pipeline companies are wholly exempt from federal energy regulatory commission jurisdiction 
state and local regulatory authorities oversee intrastate gathering and other natural gas pipeline operations 
the michigan public service commission mpsc regulates the construction  operation  rates and safety of certain natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines pursuant to state regulatory statutes 
the company conducts gas pipeline operations in michigan through an affiliate  which is subject to this regulation by the mpsc 
the design  construction  operation and maintenance of the company s pipeline are also subject to safety regulations 
natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of gas available to the company s systems or which the company can produce from its wells 
they also substantially affect the cost and profitability of conducting natural gas exploration and production activities 
environmental matters the company is subject to environmental risks normally incident to its operations and construction activities including  but not limited to  uncontrollable flows of natural gas  fluids and other substances into the environment  explosions  fires  pollution  and other environmental and safety risks 
the following is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various federal  state and local statutes  rules  regulations  or orders to which the company s operations may be subject 
for example  the company  without regard to fault  could incur liability under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended also known as the superfund law  or state counterparts  in connection with the disposal or other releases of hazardous substances  including sour gas  and for natural resource damages 
further  the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulations is toward stricter standards  and this will likely continue in the future 
the company s activities are subject to environmental and safety regulation by federal and state authorities  including  without limitation  the state environmental agencies and the federal environmental protection agency  which can increase the costs of designing  installing and operating its facilities 
in most instances  the regulatory requirements relate to the discharge of substances into the environment and include measures to control water and air pollution 
laws and regulations may require a permit or other authorization before certain activities may be conducted by the company and include fines and penalties for non compliance 
further  these rules may limit or prohibit activities within wilderness areas  wetlands  and areas providing habitat for certain species or other protected areas 
the company is also subject to other federal  state and local laws covering the handling  storage or discharge of materials used by the company 
the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations

forward looking information this annual report on form k contains statements which  to the extent that they are not recitations of historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  section a and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  section e including statements with respect to the outcome of the pending litigation matters and contract negotiations 
all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by sections a and e 
factors that most typically impact markwest s operating results and financial condition include i changes in general economic conditions in regions in which the company s products are located  ii the availability and prices of ngl and competing commodities  iii the availability and prices of raw natural gas supply  iv the ability of the company to negotiate favorable marketing agreements  v the risks that third party or company natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  vi the company s dependence on certain significant customers  producers  gatherers  treaters  and transporters of natural gas  vii competition from other ngl processors  including major energy companies  viii the company s ability to identify and consummate grass roots projects or acquisitions complementary to its business  ix winter weather conditions  and x intermediate or final decisions in the pending litigation  and the relative positions of the parties in the negotiation of new agreements 
forward looking statements involve many uncertainties that are beyond the company s ability to control and in many cases the company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
item legal proceedings as the company reported in a current report on form k  dated february   three complaints have been filed against it in the circuit court of wayne county  west virginia  by columbia gas transmission corporation and columbia natural resources  inc  equitable production company and equitable energy llc  and cobra petroleum production company et al 
these complaints each allege breach of contract and seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief and damages 
current and futures prices for natural gas have risen dramatically  and prices for natural gas liquids ngls propane  butane  etc 
have stayed essentially flat 
a large portion of markwest s processing services for gas producers in appalachia involves extracting ngls from inlet gas streams and replacing the equivalent heat content with dry natural gas purchased in the spot or forward markets 
this part of the company s operating margin depends on a positive spread between ngl prices and natural gas costs 
when feasible  the company has hedged a substantial portion of its natural gas redelivery obligation 
effective february   the company provided producers with an alternative processing contract that provides for additional compensation when processing margins are low and reduced compensation when these margins are high 
to date  about producers accounting for a minority share of the volume out of approximately have agreed to the new contract 
if producers elect to remain with the existing contract  the company has stated it will return the replacement natural gas at a later date as it believes is permitted under the existing contract such that the company can earn a reasonable fee for its services 
the complaints allege this procedure for the existing contracts constitutes a breach 
the parties have agreed to a temporary standstill to the litigation and are currently negotiating a resolution to this dispute 
there can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful or that the outcome of the litigation or the settlement discussions will be favorable to the company 
these high natural gas price conditions  of course  are not an isolated situation with markwest nationwide  producers and gas processors are renegotiating their processing agreements for this reason

pipeline operations commenced in  the fisk processing plant commenced operations in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  overview for the year ended december   net income was million  or per share  up million or per share from excluding gains on asset sales in both periods  income was million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a net income of million  or per share  for the prior year 
ebitda was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  results for the year ended december   were significantly impacted by the record ngl production and sales volumes in the gathering  processing and marketing segment 
the increased volumes are due to increased gas production behind the company s facilities  gas extraction and fractionator plant expansions and additional marketing terminals in the appalachia area 
decreased western michigan throughput and sales volume were partially offset by higher ngl prices 
natural gas production in the exploration and production segment also positively impacted results for the year ended december  daily production  net to markwest interest was  thousand cubic feet mcf per day for  a percent increase over production levels 
for the year ended december   the company expected increases in operating  general and administrative  depreciation and interest expenses 
these increases were due to the company s appalachia expansion program 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue markwest is paid for its processing services in appalachia through sales of liquids extracted and fees for units of throughput 
recent sales volumes of liquids at the company s siloam  kentucky  fractionation facility were a record million gallons compared to million gallons for  a percent increase 
higher prices and increased volumes at the terminals also benefited revenues 
for the year ended december   gas marketing revenue was million compared to million for the year ended december  the natural gas marketing activities are high volume  low margin transactions supporting markwest s processing business 
in western michigan  volumes were  mcfd for the year ended december  compared to  mcfd for the year ended december  this decline was partially offset by higher ngl prices 
exploration and production revenue natural gas sold during the year ended december  totaled  mcfd a percent increase over the  mcfd produced and sold during the year ended december  production has increased because of the company s capital program 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million or percent compared to the year ended december  similarly  sales increased by nearly percent from to the company s replacement feedstock in appalachia increased million as a result of increased volumes and unit costs 
in addition  the cost of sales for natural gas marketing increased million due to the increased volumes 
combined with a corresponding increase in gas marketing sales  the gross margin from gas marketing increased million compared to the natural gas marketing activities generate low margins  these activities are executed in support of markwest s processing business 
the cost and volume increases at the company s appalachian terminals and michigan facilities increased cost of sales by million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or percent for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to operating costs associated with incremental facilities added in appalachia since third quarter the lynchburg and lordstown terminals  the maytown  boldman and cobb extraction facilities and related pipeline  and the expanded siloam fractionation plant 
higher natural gas costs in also impacted fuel costs at its plants 
finally  increased costs to achieve increased natural gas production were realized in markwest s exploration and production segment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million or percent primarily in support of the additional and expanded appalachia facilities previously mentioned and rent for office space  the company sold its corporate headquarters and leased back its office space commencing in february depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased for the year ended december  as a result of the completion of the phase i expansion in appalachia in the first quarter of year ended december   compared to year ended december  overview for the year ended december   markwest reported net income of million  or per share  a million increase in net income over s net loss of million  or per share 
aside from the company s million  or per share  after tax gain on the sale of the company s west memphis terminal  record ngl production and sales in appalachia  coupled with improving appalachian processing margins in the company s gathering  processing and marketing segment  were the primary reasons behind the company s return to profitability in markwest sold million gallons of ngls in  a percent increase over levels  as gas production increased behind the company s facilities 
although appalachian processing margins were up over  they were still significantly below the company s ten year historical average 
increased ngl prices contributed to improving margins 
increased profitability from markwest s terminals  due to increased ngl sales prices  and michigan operations  due to increased throughput and ngl sales prices  also contributed in expected increases in operating  general and administrative  interest and depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses occurred 
gathering  processing and marketing revenue gathering  processing and marketing revenue increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the revenue increase was principally attributable to a million increase in the company s gas marketing operations 
at the company s siloam fractionation facility  higher ngl sales prices and larger volumes of ngls marketed contributed to increased revenues 
exploration and production revenue oil and gas revenue increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gas production from the prior year 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily caused by a million increase in gas marketing purchases 
at the company s siloam fractionation facility  both higher natural gas costs and larger volumes of natural gas purchased contributed to increased cost of sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses was principally attributable to four factors 
first  certain expenses increased with volumes in appalachia  michigan and the rocky mountains 
second  markwest sold and leased back three compressors at its kenova processing plant beginning in the third quarter of consequently  operating expenses include twelve full months of lease expense whereas the results from the comparable time period in do not 
further  these compressors were overhauled in third  operating expenses were lower due to a sales and use tax refund during that period 
last  performance based incentive compensation increased in  markwest did not pay bonuses in due to the company s overall net loss 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to increased performance based incentive compensation markwest did not pay incentive bonuses in due to the company s overall net loss  professional service fees also increased in due to the company s arbitration with columbia  now settled  and to increased business development expenditures 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or percent  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the company s pipeline extension in michigan placed in service during mid interest expense 
interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due to increased average outstanding debt and higher interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been internal cash flow and its revolving line of credit 
in the first quarter of  these sources were supplemented by proceeds from the sale of the company s corporate office building 
in the second quarter of  markwest increased its line of credit by million to million 
the following summary table reflects comparative cash flows for the company for the three years ended december in s net cash provided by operating activities before change in working capital    net cash provided by used in operating activities from change in working capital 
  net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    net of asset sales of   and  respectively 
capital investment program investing activities consist primarily of capital and acquisition expenditures net of asset sales 
the company s capital expenditures are summarized as follows in millions for the year ended december  gathering  processing and marketing appalachia phase i expansion phase ii expansion marketing assets western michigan pipeline expansion maintenance capital and other gathering  processing and marketing 
exploration and production rocky mountains western michigan eastern michigan exploration and production total capital expenditures looking ahead  markwest forecasts a baseline capital budget of million in in its gathering  processing and marketing segment million for completion of appalachia s phase ii expansion  million for marketing infrastructure expansion and million for maintenance capital  in its exploration and production segment million for the acquisition of san juan basin properties in january  up to million for infill drilling in the san juan basin and up to million for further expansion of the au gres  michigan property 
these latter two expenditures are discretionary and could be reduced depending on capital availability 
financing facilities financing activities consist primarily of net borrowings under the company s credit facility 
at december   the company had million of available credit  of which net debt debt less cash of million had been utilized  and working capital of million 
depending on the timing and amount of the company s future projects beyond the level described above  and the outcome of the appalachia producer litigation and negotiations described in significant and developments in items and business and properties and item legal proceedings of this form k  markwest may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
while the company believes that it will be able to secure additional financing on terms acceptable to the company  if required  no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so 
outlook in the gathering  processing and marketing segment  the appalachia phase ii expansion is expected to add  gallons per day of ngl production beginning in the third quarter of  with the expectation therefore that sales volumes of ngls from the siloam fractionator will be approximately million gallons  up percent from michigan natural gas volumes transported and processed are expected to be flat at approximately  mcfd based on resolution in the first quarter of third party litigation on several wells and hook up of a new well by the fourth quarter as a result of these additions  the year end flow rate is expected to be about  mcfd 
as the company reported in a current report on form k date february   current and futures prices for natural gas have risen dramatically  and prices for ngls propane  butane  etc 
have stayed essentially flat 
a large portion  about percent  of markwest s processing services for gas producers in appalachia involves extracting ngls from inlet gas streams and replacing the equivalent heat content with dry natural gas purchased in the spot or forward markets 
this part of the company s operating margin depends on a positive spread between ngl prices and natural gas costs 
however  when feasible  the company hedges a portion of this processing margin for example  as of february   the company had hedged million gallons for at a margin of per gallon 
effective february   the company provided producers with an alternative processing contract that provides for additional compensation when processing margins are low and reduced compensation when these margins are high 
to date  approximately producers accounting for a minority share of the volume out of approximately have agreed to the new contract 
if producers elect to remain with the existing contract  the company has stated it will return the replacement natural gas at a later date as it believes is permitted under the existing contract such that the company can earn a reasonable fee for its services 
see also item legal proceedings of this form k 
these high natural gas price conditions  of course  are not an isolated situation with markwest nationwide  producers and gas processors are renegotiating their processing agreements for this reason 
in the exploration and production segment  volumes produced are expected to increase over percent to  mcfd as a result of a january acquisition in the san juan basin  capital spending in the fourth quarter of and the full year  startup of the first well in the au gres field in eastern michigan in the third quarter of  and the expected recompletion of a second au gres well in the first half of about percent of the volumes have been hedged at a henry hub equivalent price of per mmbtu 
other key expectations for include operating costs of million  up from million in due to growth in appalachia processing volumes and higher per unit fuel costs  and increased natural gas production  general and administrative expense of million  unchanged from  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense million  up from s million as a result of capital expenditures  and a tax rate of percent one third of which is current  the balance deferred 
commodity price risk management activities reference is made to notes and of the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company s hedging strategy limited the company s after tax earnings compared to the situation of not hedging 
in the gathering  processing and marketing segment  net income would have been higher by million  million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this impact considers only hedges of appalachia processing margin and does reflect other decisions made concerning when to buy natural gas or store ngl production for sale in later months 
in the exploration and production segment  without hedging  net income would have been higher by million  million and  respectively  for the years ended december   and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces market risk from commodity price variations  primarily in the ngls it sells and in the natural gas it purchases 
it also incurs  to a lesser extent  credit risks and risks related to interest rate variations 
commodity price risk 
in the past  ngl prices and natural gas costs have fluctuated widely in response to changing market forces 
the impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings from natural gas processing and natural gas production activities have been significant and have varied from year to year 
the company typically hedges a portion of its commodity price risk 
prior to hedging activities  markwest s appalachian operations cash flow has an annual sensitivity to ngl prices equal to million in pretax income for every per gallon change in ngl prices and an annual sensitivity to natural gas prices equal to million in pretax income for every per mmbtu change in natural gas prices 
for  the company has hedged approximately percent of its appalachian keep whole volumes as of february   reducing the annual sensitivity accordingly 
with the growth in the company s exploration and production activities  the impact of variable natural gas prices on its revenues is increasing  which the company mitigates through an extensive hedging program 
as of february   the company has hedged approximately percent of its expected production for the year accordingly  markwest s annual sensitivity to natural gas prices for is million for each per mmbtu change in natural gas prices 
gains and losses experienced on hedging transactions are generally offset by the related gains or losses on the sale of the underlying product in the physical market 
see related discussion in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
credit risk 
the company is exposed to potential losses as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
the company maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk 
such policies include the evaluation of a prospective counterparty s financial condition  collateral requirements where deemed necessary  and the use of standardized agreements  which facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty 
the company also monitors the financial condition of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis 
interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its long term debt with floating interest rates 
the company may make use of interest rate swap agreements to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the debt portfolio  although no such agreements are currently in place 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on the company s debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s variable rate debt balances as of december
