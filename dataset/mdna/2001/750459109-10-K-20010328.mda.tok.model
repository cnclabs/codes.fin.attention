gross margin 
gross margin decreased to of revenue for from of revenue for the company s general business intent is to price its products for new design wins to achieve an average gross margin of approximately because the company believes this gross margin range represents the best elasticity point to maximize design wins and long term growth 
the company s gross margins for the first  second  and third quarters of were   and of revenue  respectively 
the gradual decline was a result of product mix consisting of a larger portion of higher volume  lower margin product relative to higher margin product shipped throughout the year as new design wins ramped into production 
however  the company s gross margin fell to for the quarter ended december  the fourth quarter margin was impacted by the reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity associated with the drop in revenue from million in the third quarter to million in the fourth quarter of gross margin increased to of revenue in from of revenue in primarily as a result of product mix consisting of a larger portion of higher margin product relative to lower margin product shipped  which includes products added as a result of the artic acquisition in march additionally  fixed manufacturing costs were lower relative to revenue levels during the company s gross margins are heavily influenced by its oem relationships 
the company establishes gross margin targets based on the nature of the sales it is pursuing and the desire to establish new oem relationships by pricing aggressively to achieve key sales 
however  many of the factors affecting gross margins  such as variances in unit volumes and timing of orders and component costs  are difficult or impossible to predict and can cause the company to be subject to unplanned margin variances 
gross margins on oem sales are also particularly sensitive to changes in customer mix because of margin variances among individual products and the relative importance of growth or decline of a single product or customer on overall operating results 
to mitigate the effect of short term margin variances  the company may employ step pricing techniques in which unit prices decline over the life of the product to reflect anticipated production efficiencies and or component cost reductions  or various cost sharing or cost plus pricing techniques that serve to reduce the margin risk to the company 
the company expects to see continued decreases in gross margins throughout the first half of as a result of reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million or from million in to in the increase of million in was a result of continued investment in new design wins and an increase of approximately new employees devoted to research and development during the first three quarters of total dollars spent remained relatively flat during the third and fourth quarters

selling  general and administrative

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers 
the company attempts to protect and preserve its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the portfolio 
therefore  the company would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency risk 
the company pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies 
the company s international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as they relate to revenues and operating expenses as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the company implemented a hedging policy in the fourth quarter of to mitigate exposures in all transactions and balances that are not denominated in us dollars 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company for the year ended december  was approximately the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations in was insignificant 
equity price risk 
the company is exposed to equity price risk due to equity investments held by the company 
the company typically does not attempt to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities 
neither a increase nor a decrease in equity prices would have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flow  as such investments are recorded on the company s books at less than million 
restructuring in january  the company announced its intent to consolidate all surface mount board production smt at its houston manufacturing plant into its high volume plant in hillsboro  oregon 
this decision was made in order to leverage cost efficiencies  as costs are considerably lower in the higher volume oregon plant and is consistent with prior activities of transferring low complexity product manufacturing from houston to hillsboro locations throughout system assembly will continue at the houston location 
this consolidation will result in excess capacity in houston consisting of approximately sixty people along with some equipment and space 
all affected employees will receive severance packages at termination during march and april by completing the consolidation  the company expects to reduce its overall manufacturing costs 
the company will take a pretax charge in the first quarter  which is currently estimated to be million to million
