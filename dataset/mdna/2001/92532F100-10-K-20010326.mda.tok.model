item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a biotechnology company that seeks to discover  develop and market small molecule drugs that address major medical needs 
we have seven drug candidates in clinical development to treat viral diseases  inflammation  cancer  autoimmune diseases and neurological disorders 
we have created our pipeline using a proprietary approach  information driven drug design  that integrates advanced biology  chemistry  biophysics and information technologies to make the drug discovery process more efficient and productive 
our first approved product is agenerase amprenavir  an hiv protease inhibitor  which we co promote with glaxosmithkline 
we earn a royalty from glaxosmithkline from sales of agenerase 
agenerase received us food and drug administration approval through an expedited review process for the treatment of hiv infection in agenerase has also received approval in other countries  including the member states of the european union and japan where the drug is sold under the trade name prozei 
we have significant collaborations with aventis  eli lilly  glaxosmithkline  kissei  novartis  schering ag germany  serono and taisho 
these collaborations provide us with financial support and other valuable resources for our research programs  development of our clinical drug candidates  and marketing and sales of our products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect to incur a loss in we believe that operating losses will continue beyond as we are planning to make significant investments in research and development for our other potential products 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from year to year and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
in the fourth quarter of  vertex adopted sab  revenue recognition in financial statements retroactive to january  sab was issued by the securities and exchange commission in december and provides guidance related to revenue recognition policies based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
prior to adoption of sab  we recognized revenue from collaborative research and development arrangements as earned under the terms of the arrangements 
license payments were recorded as revenue when payment was assured and contractual obligations met 
payments from contractual milestones were recognized when achieved  and product research funding was recorded on a quarterly basis  when research effort was incurred 
in adopting sab  we recognize revenue from research and development arrangements over the period of continuing involvement as the lessor of the non refundable cash received or the result achieved using percentage of completion accounting under emerging issues task force no 
where we have no continuing involvement  we will record nonrefundable license fees as revenue upon receipt and milestone revenue upon achievement of the milestone by the collaborative partner 
pursuant to the adoption of sab  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to collaborative research and development revenues recognized in prior periods 
as a result  we recorded a one time  non cash charge of  the impact of our adoption of sab was to defer revenue recognition for certain portions of revenue previously recognized under our collaborative agreements into future accounting periods 
during the year ended december   we recorded as revenue the full amount of the  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle

revenue in consisted of  in royalty and product sales revenue and  in collaborative and other research and development revenue 
royalties and product sales include agenerase royalty revenue from glaxosmithkline as well as sales of commercial drug substance to kissei in japan 
agenerase royalty revenue from glaxosmithkline was recognized for the first time in and is based upon worldwide net sales of agenerase as provided by glaxosmithkline 
the growth in collaborative and other research and development revenue in  as compared with  is largely due to new collaborative agreements signed during the year 
in may  we agreed with novartis to collaborate to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs targeted at the kinase protein family 
in connection with this contract  we recognized approximately  in revenue during in december we entered into a collaboration with serono to discover  develop and market caspase inhibitors 
previously  in november  we entered into a collaborative agreement with taisho for our caspase program 
in connection with these contracts  we recognized approximately  of revenue in  compared with  in additionally  we received and recognized as revenue a  payment from aventis under a collaborative agreement signed in october covering the development of vx  an orally active inhibitor of interleukin beta converting enzyme ice 
in november we received and recognized as revenue a  milestone from glaxosmithkline for the approval of agenerase by the european union 
as of june   the research support payments from kissei under the p map kinase collaboration ended 
collaborative and other research and development revenue for the year ended december  includes  recognized under the aventis agreement signed in october and a  milestone payment received from glaxosmithkline for us fda approval of agenerase 
the balance of collaborative and other research and development revenue for and is made up of development reimbursements and research support payments from other collaborative partners 
total costs and expenses increased to  in from  in royalties and product costs of  consist of royalty payments to gd searle co 
and the cost of commercial drug substance sold to kissei 
under the terms of the license agreement between glaxosmithkline  searle and us  we agreed to pay searle a royalty on sales of agenerase 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in principally due to the continued expansion of our research and development operations and an increase in the number of drug development candidates 
related to our expansion were increases in personnel  facilities expenses  equipment depreciation and increased technology license payments for access to gene database information 
the expenses associated with the expansion were partially offset by a decrease in external development activities associated with certain drug candidates 
we anticipate research and development expenses to continue to increase as personnel are added and research and development activities are expanded to accommodate our existing collaborations and additional commitments we may undertake in the future 
sales  general and administrative expenses were  in compared with  in the increase was primarily a result of increased personnel and professional expenses 
additionally  marketing expenses associated with agenerase increased in we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow 
interest income increased by  to  in compared with due to a higher level of cash and investments throughout the year as a result of the proceeds received from the issuance of  of convertible subordinated notes in march and september of interest expense increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase is due to interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in march and september of in the third quarter of we recognized debt conversion expense of  representing the make whole payment resulting from the call of our  aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due march march notes 
as a result of the call for redemption  the holders of the march notes were entitled to a make whole payment of per  principal amount of notes 
at december   we had a equity investment in altus of approximately  using the equity method of accounting  we recorded  as our share of the loss in altus for the twelve months ended december   compared with  for the twelve months ended december  altus is expected to incur additional losses in and we will record our proportionate share of losses against the investment balance

revenue in consisted of  in collaborative and other research and development revenue 
collaborative and other research and development revenue increased in  as compared with  due primarily to new collaborative agreements and larger milestone payments earned during the year 
in  we earned a  milestone payment from glaxosmithkline for us fda approval of agenerase 
we recorded  in collaborative revenue from aventis as part of an expanded collaborative agreement covering the development of vx in connection with a collaborative agreement signed with taisho for our caspase program  we recognized  for prior research costs and approximately  in product research funding 
included in collaborative and other research and development revenue is a  payment from schering earned in connection with the signing of a collaborative agreement for our neurophilins ligand program and a  milestone payment from glaxosmithkline for the nda filing for agenerase 
total research funding from our collaborative partners decreased by approximately  in primarily because the research funding requirements under the glaxosmithkline agreement ended on december  total costs and expenses increased to  in compared to  in royalties and product costs of  in consist of royalty payments to searle and the cost of commercial drug substance sold to kissei 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was mainly due to expansion of our operations in the uk  as well as increased development expenses due to the commencement of clinical trials in the second half of and the increase in other development activities associated with our impdh inhibitor vx  for psoriasis and hepatitis c  our neurophilins drug candidate  timcodar  for diabetic neuropathy  and our p map kinase inhibitor  vx  for inflammatory diseases 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily as a result of increased administrative requirements of our growing research and development operation  legal expenses associated with expansion of our intellectual property position and marketing expenses associated with agenerase 
interest income decreased  to  in from  in due to lower levels of cash and investments throughout the year as well as lower yields earned on investment securities 
interest expense decreased slightly in to  from  in  primarily due to lower levels of equipment financing during in february  we restructured our investment in altus  which was a majority owned subsidiary 
as part of the transaction  we provided altus  of cash and surrendered our shares in altus preferred stock in exchange for two new classes of preferred stock and warrants 
at december   we had a equity investment in altus of approximately  for the year ending december   we recorded  as our share of altus losses 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have been funded principally through strategic collaborative agreements  public offerings and private placements of our equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  and investment income 
with the approval and launch of agenerase in april  we began receiving product royalty revenues 
during the twelve months ended december   we completed a private placement of  of convertible subordinated notes due march and  of convertible subordinated notes due september we have continued to increase and advance products in our research and development pipeline 
consequently  we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis as we continue to develop existing and future compounds and to conduct clinical trials of potential drugs 
we also expect to incur substantial administrative and commercialization expenditures in the future and additional expenses related to filing  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property rights 
we expect to finance these substantial cash needs with future payments under our existing and future collaborative agreements  royalties from the sales of agenerase  existing cash and investments of  at december   together with investment income earned thereon  and facilities and equipment financing 
to the extent that funds from these sources are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of securities or other methods of financing

in  property and equipment expenditures were  cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december  was  including  in net proceeds from the issuance of  of convertible subordinated notes in march and september of  as well as  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and benefit plans 
on september   we announced the call of our march notes 
as of december    of the march notes had been converted into  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we reclassified  of related unamortized deferred debt issuance costs to stockholders equity as part of the conversion in in connection with the call for redemption  the holders of the notes were entitled to a make whole payment of per  principal amount of notes  which resulted in a one time charge to earnings of  during  we entered into two new collaborative agreements 
in may  we entered into an agreement with novartis to collaborate on the discovery  development  and commercialization of small molecule drugs directed at targets in the kinase protein family 
under the agreement  novartis agreed to pay us approximately  in pre commercial payments  comprised of  paid upon signing of the agreement  up to  in product research funding over six years and up to approximately  in further license fees and milestone payments 
these amounts are based on the development of eight drug candidates 
in addition  novartis created a  loan facility to support certain clinical studies which we may draw down in increments up to  for each drug candidate 
the loan is interest free and novartis will forgive the full amount of any advances if novartis accepts the drug candidate for development under our agreement with novartis 
in december  we entered into an agreement with serono to collaborate on the discovery  development  and commercialization of caspase inhibitors 
under the agreement  we could receive up to  in pre commercial payments  comprised of  in payments for prior research  up to  in product research funding over five years and up to  in further license fees and milestone payments 
these amounts are based on the development of more than one drug candidate

 accounting for certain derivative instruments an amendment of sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value  gains or losses  depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation
