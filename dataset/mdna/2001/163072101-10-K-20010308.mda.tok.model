we also operated grand lux cafe  an upscale casual dining restaurant located in the venetian resort hotel casino in las vegas  nevada  two self service  limited menu express foodservice operations under the cheesecake factory mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment centers in orlando  florida and chicago  illinois  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed three limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
sales and cost of sales are reported separately for restaurant and bakery activities 
all other operating cost and expense categories are reported on a combined basis for both restaurant and bakery activities 
comparable restaurant sales include the sales of restaurants open for the full period of each period being compared 
new restaurants enter the comparable sales base in their thirteenth month of operations 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal consisted of weeks 
fiscal and each consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on january  we elected early adoption of aicpa statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  during fiscal this accounting standard requires most entities to expense all noncapitalizable start up and preopening costs as incurred 
consistent with the practice of most casual dining restaurant entities  we previously deferred such costs and then amortized them over the twelve month period following openings 
the sop does not permit the restatement of previously issued financial statements  and does not require the presentation of the pro forma effect of retroactive application 
for a discussion of the potential impact of the sop for future periods  see preopening costs in this item in connection with our adoption of the sop  we modified our definition of preopening costs to include only those direct  incremental out of pocket costs incurred to open new restaurants which are not otherwise capitalizable 
prior to fiscal  deferred preopening costs and their related amortization expense included those costs plus allocated costs for management recruitment and training  as well as allocated costs related to field supervision and corporate support resources which were specifically identifiable to restaurant openings 
effective with fiscal  these allocated costs were reclassified to the general and administrative expense category 
for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  certain prior year amounts for restaurant cost of sales  labor  other operating costs and expenses  and general and administrative expenses have also been reclassified to further improve their comparability to similar cost and expense categories reported by other restaurant entities 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations of the company expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year revenues restaurant sales bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors total revenues costs and expenses restaurant cost of sales bakery cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net other expense income  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks for fiscal after adjusting for million of revenues contributed by the additional operating week  total revenues would have increased by to million for fiscal on a week basis 
restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of restaurant sales contributed by the additional operating week  restaurant sales would have increased by to million for fiscal on a week basis 
the resulting restaurant sales increase of million for fiscal on a week basis consisted of the following components million from the openings of seven new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened during fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
on a week basis for fiscal  total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  for fiscal we believe that measuring total restaurant operating weeks from period to period is the most effective way to analyze the growth rate and overall capacity of our restaurant operations 
on a week basis for fiscal  average sales per full service restaurant operating week increased to  compared to  for fiscal sales for comparable restaurants  which increased during fiscal  benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately for the fiscal year 
an additional effective menu price increase was implemented during january bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of bakery sales contributed by the additional operating week  bakery sales would have increased to million during fiscal sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased slightly to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally as a result of menu price increases and higher volume purchase discounts 
the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  chicken  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into longer term supply agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales  which include ingredient  packaging and production supply costs  were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales decreased slightly for fiscal to compared to for fiscal  principally as a result of lower dairy related commodity costs principally cream cheese  whipped cream and butter 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into longer term supply agreements for some of the key commodities used in our bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our bakery operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
the state of california increased its minimum wage by per hour to effective january  we believe that such increase should not have a material impact on our labor expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses and taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal versus for fiscal  principally due to the leveraging of the fixed component of this expense category with higher revenues 
the cost for electric and natural gas services to our restaurants was of restaurant sales for both fiscal and as of february   of our full service restaurants and our bakery production facility were located in the state of california  where both the general availability and cost of energy have recently become more volatile 
as a result  the impact of electric and natural gas services on our operations in california  and possibly in other states where we operate  will likely be less predictable during fiscal compared to prior fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of restaurant support expenses field supervision  manager recruitment and training  relocation and other related expenses  bakery administrative expenses  and corporate support and governance expenses 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our field supervision and corporate support infrastructures commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
during the four years ended with fiscal  we made significant investments to strengthen and add capacity to our operational support infrastructure in order to continue our growth plan in a controlled manner 
additional resources were allocated to building the field supervision and training organizations  strengthening the opening teams for new restaurants  recruiting and training additional qualified restaurant management personnel  and improving our financial  human resource and data warehouse information systems 
additionally  we aggressively pursued new large account customers for our bakery operation that required additional investments in bakery marketing and operational support resources 
during fiscal  we plan to further strengthen the company s infrastructure with additional investments in systems  processes and people 
however  we believe the rate of growth of g a expenses should be less than our revenue growth rate for the year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were for both fiscal and preopening costs preopening costs decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened seven restaurants during fiscal compared to eight openings during fiscal preopening costs include incremental  out of pocket costs that are directly incurred to open new restaurants and that are not otherwise capitalizable 
the principal components of preopening costs include the cost of recruiting and training the hourly staff for each new restaurant  the cost to relocate and pay the management staff assigned to each new restaurant approximately days prior to opening  the cost to send training and support staff to each opening  and the cost of practice cooking and service activities 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  casual dining restaurants  the restaurant preopening process is significantly more extensive and costly relative to that of other chain restaurant operations 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to the proximity of our other established restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the cost of travel and lodging in different metropolitan areas  and the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing and training process 
additionally  new concepts such as grand lux cafe are expected to incur initial preopening costs that could be significantly higher than preopening costs for our more established restaurant concepts 
preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant  and the fluctuations could be significant 
we expense preopening costs as they are incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal and  preopening costs for each of those years will likely exceed the respective amount of preopening costs for the applicable prior year 
interest income  other expense income and income taxes interest income increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher levels of interest bearing cash and investments during fiscal other expense for fiscal was  compared to other income of  for fiscal this decrease was principally due to the one time write off of the remaining net book value of our current restaurant point of sale system and the settlement of a sales tax audit assessment 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the million increase in restaurant sales for fiscal consisted of the following components million from the openings of eight new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened during fiscal that were not comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
restaurant operating weeks increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week increased to  for fiscal compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
sales for comparable restaurants  which increased during fiscal  benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately which was taken in february bakery sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to during fiscal versus for fiscal  principally as a result of the impact of menu price increases 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales increased to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  cost of sales for fiscal decreased to versus for fiscal  principally as a result of lower dairy related commodity costs 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses decreased slightly to compared to for fiscal other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal versus for fiscal  reflecting lower insurance costs and the leveraging of the fixed component of this expense category with higher revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our field supervision and corporate support infrastructures commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were for fiscal versus for fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal versus million for fiscal we opened eight restaurants during fiscal  including a new concept  grand lux cafe  with unusually heavy preopening costs  compared to five restaurant openings during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year long term debt  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of january  this increase was principally due to increased cash flow from operations and increased proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
the credit facility expires on may  on that date  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of our operations  with which we are currently in compliance 
during fiscal  our capital expenditures were approximately million  most of which were related to our restaurant operations 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our capital expenditure requirement to range between million  net of agreed upon landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this estimate contemplates million for as many as to new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  including an increase in estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings 
other estimated capital expenditures for fiscal include million for restaurant level technology upgrades new point of sale systems and automated front desk management systems  million for capacity additions to existing restaurants and the company s corporate center  and million for maintenance capital expenditures 
we lease the land and building shells for substantially all of our restaurants for primary lease terms that usually range from to years for our new restaurants 
we expend cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment for our new restaurants 
based on our current expansion objectives and opportunities  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  coupled with expected cash provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors has authorized the company repurchase up to  shares of our common stock for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options under our current stock option plans 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million as of january  recent accounting pronouncements we elected early adoption of statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  during fiscal this accounting standard  issued in by the american institute of cpas  requires most entities to expense all start up and preopening costs as they are incurred 
consistent with the practice of most casual dining restaurant companies  we previously deferred such costs and then wrote them off over the twelve month period following the opening of each restaurant 
the early adoption of sop was made retroactive to the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit  for fiscal was million or per diluted share and was recorded retroactively to the first quarter of as a one time charge 
this accounting standard accelerates our recognition of preopening costs but benefits the post opening results of new restaurants 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the new statement was effective the first quarter of  as amended by sfas we do not believe this new accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into longer term supply agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which increased in   and proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
the state of california increased its minimum wage by per hour to effective january   with another per hour increase approved for january additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services  continue to increase with the general level of inflation and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while the company has been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for its menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for additional rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
over one half of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results have been  and in the future are likely to be  significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their preopening costs 
year readiness to address the year issue  we began to formulate a plan during fiscal to assess  remediate and test all mission critical internal computer systems and processes 
our plan also included an assessment of the readiness of key suppliers of mission critical goods and services to our restaurant and bakery operations 
all phases of our year readiness plan were completed as scheduled 
to date  we have not experienced any year issues with respect to our internal computer systems and key suppliers  and did not experience any loss of revenues as a result of the issue 
our total costs to address the year issue were not material  and any additional costs are expected to be minimal 
although we have not experienced any year issues to date and believe that it is unlikely that any such issues will arise in the future  there can be no assurance that unforeseen year issues will not arise in the future and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal   or fiscal through february  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of january   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flow from operations and would not have an impact on net income until the securities were disposed of
