item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented on the following pages 
the principal purpose of this review is to provide the reader of the attached financial statements and accompanying footnotes with a detailed analysis of the financial results of the colonial bancgroup  inc and subsidiaries for the purposes of this item  bancgroup or the company 
among other things  this discussion provides commentary on bancgroup s history  operating philosophies  the components of net interest margin and balance sheet strength as measured by the quality of assets  the composition of the loan portfolio and capital adequacy 
strategy bancgroup was reorganized in as a holding company with one bank and million in assets 
through the acquisition of community banks and strong internal growth  bancgroup has grown to a billion multi state bank holding company whose bank subsidiary  colonial bank  operates branch sales offices through operating regions in six states 
these operating regions are sometimes referred to in this discussion as regional banks 
the foundation of bancgroup is built upon a community banking philosophy that allows local responsibility for customer relationships 
this operating philosophy has been important in making acquisitions  retaining skilled and highly motivated local management teams and developing a strong customer base  particularly with respect to lending relationships 
the expertise in each local market is supported by consolidated operations and a centralized credit review function  which allows the local banking officers to concentrate on the customer 
through this structure of local customer relationship responsibility and consolidated operations  the local banks have decision making capability while at the same time having an effective operational structure at their disposal to service the customer in the most cost effective and efficient manner 
there will continue to be considerable competition in all of bancgroup s markets 
now that the previous objectives of expanding our geographic footprint through acquisitions and streamlining operations have been substantially achieved  bancgroup has positioned itself to continue its success by focusing inward  employing internal growth strategies and fully utilizing its corporate synergies and efficiencies 
these internal growth strategies include quality loan growth through its management expertise in each regional market  generating deposit growth through the development of customer relationships and competitive product offerings  continued development of its presence in the company s higher growth markets  growth in noninterest income through continued expansion of its fee based products and services and the ongoing development of its sales oriented business culture with an emphasis on customer service 
loan and deposit growth from through  bancgroup s acquisitions established operations in some of the highest growth markets in the country such as atlanta  orlando  miami  southwest florida  dallas and las vegas 
due to the success of these efforts bancgroup s concentration of loans and deposits has significantly changed 
from to  the company s loans in alabama as a percent of total loans have declined from to while during the same time loans in florida as a percentage of total loans have increased from in to in we expect our presence in all of these new markets to provide bancgroup the basis for future earnings growth 
the following table illustrates the change in bancgroup s regional composition of loans and deposits years prior to are as originally reported  prior to restatements for poolings of interests 
to total at december  loans alabama florida georgia other deposits alabama florida georgia other loan and deposit growth is emphasized in each market area through the company s regional banks 
bancgroup has been successful in competing for loans against other larger institutions  due primarily to the company s local lending strategy which includes direct involvement by local management and directors 
because markets and communities differ widely  customers require different answers and solutions to their financial needs 
customers appreciate the knowledge of their business needs and the local environment that local banking officers can provide 
bancgroup s goal is to meet the financial needs of retail and commercial banking customers 
bancgroup expects to continue its successful growth by building on these local relationships 
internal loan growth was and for and  respectively  while average retail deposits grew for both and the following table illustrates the contribution of each state and reflects the significant impact of the high growth markets on consolidated loan and deposit growth 
of total at december  contribution to internal loan growth alabama florida georgia other contribution to retail deposit growth alabama florida georgia other not only is it important to continue our growth but to also maintain our consistent strength in asset quality 
loan portfolio strength is sustained through establishing customer relationships  maintaining variety in the real estate loan portfolio and maintaining geographic diversity while continuing our conservative underwriting standards and credit review process 
eighty percent of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
there are no major concentrations in any particular type of real estate loan 
the loan portfolio reflects geographic diversity from alabama to atlanta then south to central  southwest and south florida and westward in dallas and nevada 
each of these markets has a unique business environment which reacts quite differently to various economic conditions 
atlanta is considered the financial hub of the southeast  a distribution center and light manufacturing center while central georgia is more rural with agricultural emphasis 
in addition to the many retirement communities throughout florida  there is also significant development in other business sectors 
central florida is considered a travel and entertainment destination  and is a growing area for service and support businesses 
south florida is considered a gateway to latin america and south america which provides for an opportunity to expand international banking activities 
dallas is a financial hub in the southwest and is the home of numerous corporate headquarters  which generate significant growth in infrastructure and support services 
las vegas and reno are both travel and entertainment destinations and are fast becoming retiree destinations as well 
consequently  the company believes that this overall geographic diversity will allow the loan portfolio to fare well during challenging national economic conditions 
the local expertise with established customer relationships combined with independent oversight of credit decisions and conservative underwriting standards are key to the maintenance of high asset quality 
the senior credit administration function provides the primary oversight of the credit review process 
this administration function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continual basis 
in addition  the company has established regional bank loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight through their participation in the state loan committees 
as previously stated  establishing local customer relationships  maintaining variety in the real estate loan portfolio  maintaining geographic diversity  continuing conservative underwriting standards and utilizing local expertise with independent oversight in credit decisions are all factors that allow bancgroup to maintain high asset quality  which is at the forefront of the company s strategy 
bancgroup s asset quality is demonstrated by its charge off history and nonperforming asset levels  which for the past ten years have been among the lowest of our southeastern peers 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate was at december   its lowest year end level in ten years 
net charge offs were of average loans in and which also compare favorably to national averages 
deposit growth is a primary focus of the company s sales efforts 
management has established several initiatives to accomplish its deposit growth goals 
in january  bancgroup established a branch incentive program in which one of the key goals is for employees to achieve a quarterly deposit growth rate in their branches 
in order to provide branch sales personnel with the necessary tools to accomplish their goals  they receive an on going series of training programs in relationship based selling  which develops their sales skills 
the company is in the process of enhancing its customer information system in order to facilitate the further development of existing customer relationships 
this enhanced system will allow sales personnel to more effectively sell products and services to its customers by providing information related to the customer s product or service needs 
management has also contracted with a marketing consultant to target specific products and markets for future deposit campaigns in order to more cost effectively increase and retain its deposit base 
each of these initiatives is designed to provide a solid foundation for achieving the company s deposit growth objectives 
the regional banks have additional growth opportunities through the development of customer relationships by cross selling a variety of bank products and services 
these products and services include various deposit products as well as other services such as wealth management  cash management  electronic banking  credit card and merchant services 
as market demographics change  products and services are structured to meet the needs of a particular region or customer 
strong regional bank management supported by bancgroup s asset liability and product and services management teams provide the company with the resources to remain competitive in its deposit markets through on going efforts to identify and implement products and services with attractive pricing that meet customer needs 
the company has established a strategy to grow and retain its deposit base while remaining competitive in deposit pricing and meeting the company s funding and liquidity goals through the monitoring of our markets and customer needs and the expansion of sales efforts in the local branch sales office network 
growth market expansion as noted above  bancgroup  through acquisitions has established operations in some of the highest growth markets in the country such as atlanta  orlando  miami  southwest florida  dallas and las vegas 
as evidenced by the previous charts  this strategy has contributed significantly to the company s growth 
bancgroup plans to continue its expansion in these high growth areas by selectively filling in these markets 
this expansion will come primarily through the strategic placement of new branch locations that will expand our market presence and provide additional customer service in these areas 
bancgroup s subsidiary bank acquired two additional branches in nevada in january and has plans to establish approximately new branches in the high growth markets listed above in the next two years 
noninterest income growth customer needs are constantly changing and bancgroup continues to investigate methods of improving customer service through new services  product enhancements and technological advancements 
our current objective is to grow income from noninterest income sources by concentrating on wealth management products and services  cash management services  international banking services and electronic banking services 
noninterest income from continuing operations excluding nonrecurring income from the gain on sale of certain branches and other miscellaneous items increased in and in because of our markets and the customers we serve  the company expects wealth management products and services to play a major role in future growth 
through bancgroup s current investment services  the company offers discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
in the company expects to complete the establishment of colonial brokerage  inc as a member of the nasd which will allow the company to perform additional broker dealer activities in order to better service its customers 
income from wealth management services has increased in the last two years 
growth rates are expected to continue upward with the implementation of a financial planning department and the expanded services of colonial brokerage  inc bancgroup offers a complete package of cash management services  which include lock box services  sweep accounts  zero balance accounts  electronic data interchange  automated clearinghouse  and business banker plus tm  an online tool for bank account reporting services 
revenue from cash management services increased in the last two years 
bancgroup expects to continue growth in cash management services by expanding these services to existing customers through cross sell opportunities and enhanced sales efforts in our growth markets 
the company has in place strong local management with expertise in international banking 
through the efforts of this management team  international banking revenues have increased in the last two years 
the company provides letters of credit to top tier banks  pre export financing  import financing  funds transfer and check clearing services  trade syndication  merchant banking services and other miscellaneous services through the international banking department 
the company also services international customers through its private and executive banking group in miami 
bancgroup expects revenue from these services to grow through the increase in international customers and the need for these services 
to meet customer s demands for banking when and where they want it  bancgroup continues to expand its electronic banking services 
the company has plans to offer additional services through the internet and to introduce a visa business check card 
the company added new atms to its network in and will continue to install atms in the most convenient and high traffic locations in order to provide better customer service and complement bancgroup s retail branch sales office network 
revenue generated by electronic banking services has increased in the last two years 
the company plans to continue to expand resources to ensure all products and services are among the most competitive in our markets 
bancgroup has established a product review team to perform an in depth study of all products and services and recommend future product enhancement strategies by mid sales relationships  customer service and profits bancgroup recognizes the need to continue its focus on a sales oriented culture 
the company has taken several steps to promote a more sales focused environment 
these initiatives include converting branches to sales offices by reducing operational tasks to allow sales office personnel to focus on selling customer services  implementation of sales training for employees and the establishment of a sales incentive program designed to reward employees based on their sales office s achievement of specific objectives 
the company also incorporated into the incentive plan a customer service rating through the use of an independent company to shop the sales offices to test their level of product knowledge and customer service 
loan officers also participate in production oriented incentive compensation programs 
the company began an effort in to assign customers to a particular bank officer or branch sales representative 
this assignment of customers will make one banker responsible for each customer relationship which will enhance customer relationships through better anticipation of the customer s financial needs 
we believe that all of these efforts have contributed to the previously discussed growth experienced in loans  deposits and noninterest income as well as the effective containment of noninterest expenses 
in addition these efforts are expected to enhance cross selling of products and services and expand customer relationships to include additional services 
bancgroup cannot guarantee its success in implementing the initiatives or reaching the goals outlined in this discussion 
the following analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides details with respect to this summary material and identifies trends concerning the initiatives taken in business combinations bancgroup s growth strategy has been to merge other financial institutions into bancgroup in order to increase the company s market share in existing markets  expand into other growth markets  more efficiently absorb the company s overhead and add profitable new lines of business 
bancgroup has completed the following business combinations with other financial institutions 
these business combinations have been reflected in the financial statements at december  the balances reflected below are as of the date of consummation

accordingly  all financial statement amounts have been restated to reflect the financial condition and results of operations as if the combinations had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented 
the combination with cnb holding was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  however  due to immateriality  the prior year financial statements were not restated 
the remaining business combinations were accounted for as purchases  and the operations and income of the combined institutions are included in the income of bancgroup from the date of purchase 
the combination with tb t  inc included shares previously re purchased by the company as treasury shares 
each of the combined institutions that were accounted for as purchases was merged into bancgroup or one of its subsidiaries as of the listed dates  and the income and expenses have not been separately accounted for since the respective mergers 
for this reason and due to the fact that significant changes have been made to the cost structure of each combined institution  a separate determination of the impact after combination on the earnings of bancgroup for cannot reasonably be determined

three year comparisons of net interest income in dollars and the yields on a tax equivalent basis are reflected on the following schedule 
this schedule is presented on a consolidated basis  which includes the mortgage operations 
the net yield on interest earning assets was in compared to in and in over this period net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million for from million for and million for the principal factors affecting the company s yields and net interest income are discussed on the following pages 
levels of interest rates 
in mid  the federal reserve began raising their target for the fed funds rate from to up a total of basis points by may the average fed funds rate target for was  basis points above the average of 
this large and rapid increase in market rates contributed to the decline in bancgroup s net interest margin 
the funding mix also contributed to the decline as deposit growth was concentrated in higher cost cd s and a new higher rate money market account launched in early these changes in funding mix were primarily the result of competitive pressure and the customers desire for higher rate deposits in each of the company s markets 
additionally short term and therefore rate sensitive borrowings rose million 
altogether the rate on interest bearing liabilities rose basis points from in to in the yield on earning assets was not able to keep pace rising just basis points from in to in additionally  we estimate that bancgroup s exit from the mortgage servicing business accounted for basis point of the decline in margin 
this is due to the average decline for of million in mortgage loans held for sale  the million in mortgage servicing rights and the million in non interest bearing custodial deposits 
the outlook for rates in is much different 
the economy appears to have slowed and the federal reserve has reacted quickly with two basis point declines in their target fed funds rate in january alone 
the market has expectations for additional declines as well 
as discussed in the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity section  bancgroup s net interest income and margin should benefit from the rate decline in growth in earning assets 
one of the most significant factors in the company s increase in income has been the  and increase in average interest earning assets in   and  respectively 
in addition  and equally significant  average net loans increased billion from december  to december  earning assets as a percentage of total average assets were  and in  and respectively 
however  the impact on net interest income from the growth in average loans was over shadowed by the compression in the net interest margin as previously discussed 
mortgage loans held for sale 
mortgage loans held for sale represent single family residential mortgage loans originated or acquired then packaged and sold 
the level and direction of long term interest rates have a dramatic impact on the volume of mortgage loan originations from new construction and refinancings 
in october  the company sold the wholesale production unit of the mortgage banking division 
as a result of decreased activity due to the aforementioned sale and increasing mortgage interest rates  average mortgage loans held for sale decreased to million in from million in and million in also as a result of the sale of the wholesale production unit  the company has entered into a third party correspondent relationship for the sale of its retail production of fixed rate mortgage loans  which substantially eliminates the need to hedge interest rate risk associated with new production 
loan mix 
at december   the company s mix of loans reflected an increase in construction loans and commercial real estate loans to and of the total portfolio from and  respectively  at december  residential real estate loans decreased to of the total portfolio at december   from at december  the increase in the construction and commercial real estate loans is primarily the result of loan growth in the georgia  florida  nevada and texas regions 
the residential real estate loans are predominantly adjustable rate first mortgages that have a low level of credit risk and accordingly have lower yields than other types of loans 
noninterest earning assets 
the decline in average noninterest earning assets of million from to is primarily due to the sale of the mortgage servicing rights as a result of the company s exit from that line of business  and more efficient cash management 
average cash balances declined by million in and million in  as a result of specific programs aimed at improving the company s cash management efficiency 
cost of funds 
the average cost of funds increased to in  compared to in and in the higher average cost of funds is primarily the result of the previously discussed increase in interest rates that began july and continued into bancgroup funds loans primarily with customer deposits 
competitive pressures on new time deposits and variable interest deposits remained strong 
due to these pressures  the company s funding mix has shifted during the past two years to a higher concentration of borrowings  primarily through credit facilities with the federal home loan bank 
the percentage of average total borrowings to total funding sources is for and and for these borrowings are an excellent funding source since they are at rates lower than or comparable to what the market rates are for new time deposit funds 
in addition to these sources  the company has initiated strategies to increase deposits through its retail branch network 
as discussed under liquidity and interest sensitivity  bancgroup s management considers these sources of funds to be adequate to fund future loan growth 
noninterest bearing deposits 
noninterest bearing deposits decreased by million from to as a result of the transfer of custodial deposits linked to the mortgage servicing rights sold during late and as part of the company s decision to exit the mortgage servicing business

average noninterest bearing retail deposits remained flat in while service charges declined 
competitive pressures and increasing rates resulting in a shift to other deposit products are the primary reason for the decline in service charges in the increase in of is primarily the result of increases in volume  increases in service fee rates  and the acquisitions completed in other income of million was recorded in as a result of gains on the sales of the five supermarket branches and the company s dalton  georgia branches as well as other one time miscellaneous income

as discussed in note to bancgroup s consolidated financial statements  bancgroup defers certain salary and benefit costs associated with loan originations and amortizes these costs as yield adjustments over the life of the related loans 
net occupancy expense increases are primarily due to new branch construction  improvements to existing branch locations and the relocation of certain branches and regional headquarters for better market presence 
furniture and equipment expense increases are due to the previously mentioned branch initiatives as well as improvements to the company s computer and communications technology 
these improvements give the company the ability to expand its customer base and continue to improve customer service and back office efficiencies 
in these increases were offset by reductions in costs related to the sale of certain branches

the decrease in of professional services and travel and the remaining decreases in are primarily the result of the completion of the conversion process in and of two and seven acquired banks  respectively 
the increases in other expenses are due to normal expenses resulting from the company s growth

these items  as well as a more detailed analysis of bancgroup s financial condition  are discussed in the following sections 
loans growth in loans and maintenance of a high quality loan portfolio are principal ingredients for improved earnings 
management s emphasis within all of bancgroup s banking regions is on loan growth in accordance with local market demands and in reliance upon the lending experience and expertise in the regional banks 
management believes that its strategy of meeting local demands and utilizing local lending expertise has proved successful 
this success is evident in internal loan growth of in  in  in and in  excluding acquisitions 
internal loan growth continues to be a major factor in bancgroup s increasing earnings 
this local customer relationship responsibility combined with independent oversight of credit decisions and conservative underwriting standards are key to the maintenance of the company s high asset quality 
management believes that any existing concentrations of loans  whether geographically  by industry  or by borrower  do not expose bancgroup to unacceptable levels of risk 
the current concentration of loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
these differences  in addition to our emphasis on quality underwriting  serve to reduce the risk of losses 
bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans representing and of total loans  respectively 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans are spread geographically throughout alabama and florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas and reno and las vegas  nevada with no more than of these loans in any one geographic region 
the alabama economy experiences a generally slow but steady rate of growth  while georgia  florida  texas and nevada are experiencing higher rates of growth 
real estate in bancgroup s lending areas has not experienced significantly inflated values due to excessive speculation or inflationary pressures 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate and construction portfolios consists of various property types with no one property type constituting a concentration 
for bancgroup  these property types are primarily multi family housing  hotels  office buildings  warehouses  shopping centers  amusement recreational facilities  one to four family residential housing developments  and health service facilities 
bancgroup has diversified its portfolio of commercial real estate loans with less than of its loan portfolio concentrated in any of the previously mentioned income producing activities 
risk is further reduced by the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans continue to perform at acceptable levels 
net charge offs to average loans for the commercial real estate portfolio were 
and for and  respectively 
net charge offs to average loans for the construction portfolio were 
and 
for and  respectively 
bancgroup also continues to have a significant concentration of residential real estate loans as they represent of total loans 
substantially all of these loans are adjustable rate first mortgages on single family  owner occupied properties  and therefore  have minimal credit risk and lower interest rate sensitivity 
a portion of these loans was acquired through bank acquisitions 
bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
loans classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural  representing of total loans  consist of secured and unsecured credit lines and equipment loans for various industrial  agricultural  commercial  financial retail  or service businesses 
the risk associated with loans in this category are generally related to earnings capacity of  and the cash flows generated from  the individual business activities of the borrowers 
consumer loans  representing of total loans  are loans to individuals for various purposes 
automobile loans and unsecured loans make up the majority of these loans 
the principle source of repayment is the earning capacity of the individual borrower  as well as the value of the collateral for secured loans 
bancgroup s international banking department  located in the miami region  engages in confirming letters of credit  primarily with top tier banks in latin america 
loans outstanding to latin american banks at december totaled approximately million 
however  due to the immaterial balance of these loans in relation to total loans  these amounts will not be reported separately 
bancgroup established a mortgage warehouse lending department in the third quarter of this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to top tier mortgage companies predominantly in the southeast 
loans outstanding at december  and were million and million  respectively  with unfunded commitments of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these loans are categorized as other loans in the following schedule 
bancgroup does not have a syndicated lending department  however  the company has fourteen credits with commitments funded and unfunded of million that fall within the bank regulatory definition of a shared national credit generally defined as a total loan commitment in excess of million that is shared by three or more lenders 
the largest outstanding amount to any single borrower is under million  with the smallest credit being approximately  although by definition these are considered shared national credits  bancgroup s loan officers have established long term relationships with each of these borrowers 
these commitments are comprised of the following commercial real estate projects located within existing markets international credits which are comprised of unfunded short term commitments to tier one correspondent banks mortgage warehouse lines to two large institutions the mortgage warehouse lending department conducts its own audits of these borrowers operating facilities to two large national corporations headquartered in the florida markets bancgroup participates heavily in the management of each of the relationships 
management believes that these are sound participations involving credits that fit within colonial s lending philosophy and meet it s conservative underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  none of these credits was adversely classified in the last federal bank regulatory examination of shared national credits  and these loans are currently in full compliance with all terms and agreements 
as discussed more fully in subsequent sections  management has established policies and procedures to ensure maintenance of adequate liquidity and liquidity sources 
bancgroup has arranged funding sources in addition to customer deposits that provide the company the capability to exceed a loan to deposit ratio and maintain adequate liquidity

the goals of bancgroup with respect to loan maturities and rate sensitivity continue to focus on shorter term maturities and floating or adjustable rate loans 
at december   approximately of loans were floating rate loans 
contractual maturities may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan pay offs 
the uncertainties of future events  particularly with respect to interest rates  make it difficult to predict the actual maturities

bancgroup s directive in this regard is carried out through its policies and procedures for the underwriting and ongoing review of loans and through a company wide senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continued basis 
in addition  the company has established regional bank loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight by participating in the state loan committees 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the credit worthiness of the borrower  but generally require maximum loan to value ratios of for commercial real estate and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
collateral values referenced above are monitored and estimated by loan officers through inspections  reference to broad measures of market values  and current experience with similar properties or collateral 
loans with loan to value ratios in excess of have potentially higher risks which are offset by other factors including the borrowers  or guarantors credit worthiness  the borrowers other banking relationships  the bank s lending experience with the borrower  and any other potential sources of repayment 
based on the credit review process and loan grading system  bancgroup determines its allowance for possible loan losses and the amount of provision for loan losses 
the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb potential losses on loans present in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  the provision for possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance  and the allowance for loan losses of acquired banks 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
the overall goal and result of these policies and procedures is to provide a sound basis for new credit extensions and an early recognition of problem assets to allow increased flexibility in their timely disposition 
loan loss experience the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was   and in   and  respectively 
as a result of the company s localized lending strategies and early identification of potential problem loans  bancgroup s net charge offs have been consistently low 
in addition  the current concentration of residential real estate loans has had a favorable impact on net charge offs 
the following schedule reflects greater than coverage of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated by the allowance for loan losses 
management has not targeted any specific coverage ratio in excess of  and the coverage ratio may fluctuate significantly as larger loans are placed into or removed from nonperforming status 
management s focus has been on establishing reserves related to an early identification of potential problem loans 
management is committed to maintaining adequate reserve levels to absorb losses present in the loan portfolio

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is also to charge off consumer installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued      aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower      total nonperforming loans      other real estate and in substance foreclosure      repossessions total nonperforming assets      aggregate loans contractually past due days for which interest is being accrued      total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of total loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more which are still accruing interest fluctuations from year to year in the balances of nonperforming assets are attributable to several factors including changing economic conditions in various markets  nonperforming assets obtained in various acquisitions and the disproportionate impact of larger over  individual credits 
management  through its loan officers  internal credit review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of potential problem loans not included above 
the status of these loans is reviewed at least quarterly by loan officers and annually by bancgroup s centralized credit review function and by regulatory agencies 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment inadequate  the loans are reduced to estimated recoverable amounts through increases in reserves allocated to the loans or charge offs 
as of december   substantially all of these loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans as potential problem loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these potential problem loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
the above nonperforming loans and potential problem loans represent all material credits for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans was not significant for the years ended december      and the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
securities on a daily basis  bancgroup determines the funds available for short term investment 
funds available for long term investment are projected based upon anticipated loan and deposit growth  liquidity needs  pledging requirements and maturities of securities  as well as other factors 
based on these factors and management s interest rate and income tax forecasts  an investment strategy is determined 
significant elements of this strategy as of december  include bancgroup s investment in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies including mortgage backed securities are substantially all pledged against public funds deposits or used as collateral for repurchase agreements 
bancgroup is required to carry federal home loan bank fhlb stock in connection with its borrowings from the fhlb 
bancgroup is also required to carry federal reserve stock since its subsidiary bank is a member bank of the federal reserve system 
investment alternatives that maximize the after tax net yield are considered 
management has also attempted to increase the investment portfolio s overall yield by investing funds in excess of pledging requirements in high grade corporate notes and mortgage backed securities 
the maturities of investment alternatives are determined in consideration of the yield curve  liquidity needs and the company s asset liability gap position 
the risk elements associated with the various types of securities are also considered in determining investment strategies 
us treasury and non callable us government agency obligations are considered to contain virtually no default or prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities have varying degrees of risk of impairment of principal 
impairment risk is primarily associated with changes in interest rates and accelerated prepayments  particularly with respect to longer maturities purchased at a premium and interest only strip securities 
bancgroup s mortgage backed security portfolio as of december  does not include any interest only strip securities and the amount of unamortized premium on mortgage backed securities is approximately  obligations of state and political subdivisions  as well as other securities  have varying degrees of credit risk associated with the individual borrowers 
the credit ratings and the credit worthiness of these securities are reviewed periodically and appropriate reserves are established when necessary 
investment securities are those securities which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
the decline in investment securities is due to maturities and calls in the portfolio 
securities available for sale represent those securities that bancgroup intends to hold for an indefinite period of time or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk and other similar factors 
these securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses  net of any tax effect  added or deducted from shareholders equity 
the balance in securities available for sale decreased from billion at december   to billion at december  at december   there was no single issuer  with the exception of the us government and us government agencies  where the aggregate book value of these securities exceeded of shareholders equity million 
the changes noted above are reflected on the following table

securities available for sale are shown as maturing within one year although bancgroup intends to hold these securities for an indefinite period of time 
see contractual maturities in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this category excludes all corporate common and preferred stock since these instruments have no maturity date 
expected and actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or pre pay obligations without call or pre payment penalties 
mortgage servicing rights and servicing hedge in july   the company announced definitive plans to exit the mortgage servicing business 
as of december   all sales of servicing rights and transfers of underlying loans were completed 
for this reason  msr s were at december  compared to million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for details on discontinued operations as a result of the previously discussed plans to exit the mortgage servicing business  all hedges related to msr s were liquidated during the third quarter of at december   the company had hedged approximately of the msr asset primarily through the use of floors and principal only strips 
the hedge positions were monitored daily and adjusted as necessary for changes in the market and projected interest rate movement 
the objective of this strategy was to achieve a high degree of correlation between changes in value associated with the hedged asset the servicing portfolio and the related servicing rights and the servicing hedge 
the servicing hedge was designed to rise in value when interest rates fell and decline in value when interest rates rose  in contrast to the expected movements in value of the servicing asset  therefore reducing earnings volatility caused by interest rate movements 
deposits bancgroup s deposit structure consists of the following december  of total in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits   interest bearing demand deposits   savings deposits   certificates of deposits less than    certificates of deposits more than    ira s   open time deposits   total deposits   bancgroup  through its acquisitions and branch expansion programs  has increased its market presence into high growth markets in the country 
prior to  the expansion was concentrated in florida and the atlanta metropolitan area 
in  colonial continued its efforts by moving west into dallas  texas and reno and las vegas  nevada 
the principal goal is to provide the company s retail customer base with convenient access to branch locations while enhancing the company s potential for future increases in profitability 
the growth of deposits continues to be a primary strategic initiative of bancgroup  although competition for deposits remains strong within the banking industry as well as increased competition from other business sectors 
bancgroup is continuing initiatives to grow deposits throughout its markets 
the high growth areas of florida are a primary focus due to the lower cost of funds in that market 
average retail deposits excluding mortgage custodial and brokered deposits increased million in which represents a growth over s average 
bancgroup s retail deposit base is currently in alabama  in florida  in georgia  in texas  and in nevada 
as market demographics change  products and services are structured to meet the needs of a particular region or customer base 
strong regional bank management supported by bancgroup s asset liability and product and services management teams provide the company with resources to remain competitive in it s deposit markets 
in january  a branch incentive plan was implemented in which a key goal is for employees to obtain an established deposit growth rate in their branches 
the company began a process to enhance its customer information system which will allow more effective marketing of deposit products 
management also contracted with a marketing consultant to target specific markets and products for future campaigns 
each of these initiatives should provide a solid foundation for achieving bancgroup s deposit objectives 
the growth in retail deposits in provided funds which allowed for the reduction in the brokered deposits of million as well as off setting the reduction in mortgage custodial deposits of million 
the reduction in mortgage custodial deposits is a result of the company s exit from the mortgage servicing business discussed previously 
the company s brokered certificate of deposit cd program offers cd s in increments of  to  to out of market customers at competitive rates and maturities 
at december  and  million and million  respectively were outstanding under this program 
the company has a brokered money market program that attracts deposits from out of market customers 
at december  and  million and million were outstanding  respectively 
short term borrowings short term borrowings were comprised of the following at december   and in thousands fhlb borrowings    federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements    reverse repurchase agreements    current maturities fhlb advances    other short term borrowings   total    to assist in funding loan growth  bancgroup has credit facilities with the fhlb 
at december  and  bancgroup had borrowings of  and  outstanding of which million and million  respectively  are included in long term debt with the remaining portion included in short term borrowings  leaving credit availability at december  of million based on current collateral 
this credit facility is collateralized by the company s residential real estate loans 
correspondent banks and customers provide a consistent base of short term funds with  million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively  in fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
short term borrowings  including fhlb borrowings  have been used to fund short term assets  primarily mortgage loans held for sale and loans 
as discussed more fully in the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity section of this report  the line of credit with fhlb is considered a primary source of funding for the company s asset growth 
recent changes in the fhlb collateral policy will allow bancgroup to pledge commercial real estate loans in addition to residential real estate loans 
given bancgroup s commercial real estate portfolio this will provide additional borrowing capacity 
bancgroup entered into reverse repurchase arrangements under which it purchased mortgage backed securities 
these securities are collateral for the million in short term debt as well as the million in long term debt 
during  bancgroup entered into a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution totaling million of which million was outstanding at december  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity bancgroup has addressed its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity through its policies and structure for asset liability management 
it has created the asset liability management committee almco  the objective of which is to optimize the net interest margin while assuming reasonable business risks 
almco annually establishes operating constraints for critical elements of bancgroup s business  such as liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
almco constantly monitors performance and takes action in order to meet its objectives 
of primary concern to almco  is maintaining adequate liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
the consolidated statement of cash flows identifies the three major sources and uses of cash liquidity as operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities reflect cash generated from operations 
management views cash flow from operations as a major source of liquidity 
investing activities represent a primary usage of cash with the major net increase being attributed to loan growth 
when securities mature they are generally reinvested in new securities or assets held for sale 
financing activities generally provide funding for the growth in loans and securities with increased deposits 
short term borrowings are used to provide funding for temporary gaps in the funding of long term assets and deposits  as well as to provide funding for mortgage loans held for sale and loan growth 
bancgroup has the ability to tap other markets for certificates of deposits and to utilize established lines for federal funds purchased and fhlb advances 
bancgroup maintains and builds diversified funding sources in order to provide flexibility in meeting its requirements 
from through  the significant changes in bancgroup s cash flows have centered around loan growth and fluctuations in mortgage loans held for sale 
loan growth of billion in both and has been one of the principal uses of cash in both years 
mortgage loans held for sale decreased in providing million in funds compared to million provided in the increase in deposits of million in and million in provided the primary source of funding for internal loan growth 
short term borrowings increased million in due to the funding of internal loan growth and decreased million in as a result of year end decline in mortgage loans held for sale 
bancgroup had billion and billion of residential real estate loans at december  and  respectively 
these loans provide collateral for the current billion credit facility at the fhlb 
as discussed above  additional borrowing capacity will be available in the future 
at december   the fhlb unused line of credit was million of which million was available based on current collateral 
this line provides the company significant flexibility in asset liability management  liquidity and deposit pricing 
on march   colonial bank issued million in subordinated notes due march  these notes are not subject to redemption prior to maturity and pay interest semiannually on march and september this subordinated debt qualifies as tier ii capital 
in july  the company entered into a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution totaling million of which million was outstanding at december  this facility bears interest at a rate of above libor and expires in july in  bancgroup entered into reverse repurchase arrangements under which it purchased mortgage backed securities 
at december  these securities are collateral for the million in short term debt as well as the million in long term debt 
during  and in connection with the acquisition of asb bancshares  inc  bancgroup issued million of variable rate subordinated debentures 
the debentures bear interest equal to the new york prime rate minus but not less than 
bancgroup had an outstanding term note with an unaffiliated financial institution in the amount of million at december  which was paid in full upon maturity 
in january  bancgroup issued million in trust preferred securities 
these securities qualify as tier i capital and carry an interest rate 
a portion of the proceeds of the offering was utilized to pay off a term note and revolving debt outstanding 
the remainder of the proceeds was used for acquisitions and other business purposes 
bancgroup has outstanding  million and million of bank owned life insurance boli at december  and  respectively 
this long term asset represents life insurance purchased from highly rated insurance companies on certain employees with bancgroup named as the beneficiary 
the company considers these funds available for the future payment of benefits due the employee s beneficiaries from group benefit plans 
management believes its liquidity sources and funding strategies are adequate given the nature of its asset base and current loan demand 
the primary uses of funds as reflected in the holding company only statement of cash flows note were million for the payment of interest on debt  million for the purchase of treasury stock  and million for the payment of dividends 
the holding company s primary sources of funds were million in dividends received from its subsidiaries  million in short term borrowings  and cash 
dividends payable by national and state banks in any year  without prior approval of the appropriate regulatory authorities  are limited to the bank s net profits as defined for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
under these limitations  approximately million of retained earnings plus certain earnings would be available for distribution to bancgroup  from its subsidiaries  as dividends in without prior approval from the respective regulatory authorities 
the holding company anticipates that the cash flow needs of the holding company will be less than the regulatory dividend restrictions of its subsidiary bank 
at december   bancgroup s liquidity position was adequate with loan maturities of billion  or of the total loan portfolio  due within one year 
securities totaling billion or of the total portfolio also had maturities within one year or have been classified as available for sale 
as of december   there were  however  no current plans to dispose of any significant portion of these securities 
in addition bancgroup has million in additional borrowing capacity at the fhlb  million from fed fund lines and million from a revolving credit facility with an unaffiliated financial institution 
bancgroup s asset liability management policy has also established targets for interest rate sensitivity 
changes in interest rates will necessarily lead to changes in the net interest margin 
it is almco s goal to minimize volatility in the net interest margin by taking an active role in managing the level  mix and maturities of assets and liabilities and by analyzing and taking action to manage mismatch and basis risk 
bancgroup s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools 
one measure of the company s exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the company s maturity and rate sensitivity analysis 
the following table represents the output from the company s simulation model and measures the impact on net interest income and on net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of interest sensitive assets  interest sensitive liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
following are the estimated impacts of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december  percentage change in basis points net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents variance in net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various scenarios 
the stable environment was as of december  when the federal funds rate was 
the percentage change in this column represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus the net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
the results of our simulation model reflect that bancgroup s net interest income will benefit from a decline in rates versus rates as of year end  while the current risk exposure is to rising rates 
the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table summarizes bancgroup s interest rate sensitivity at december  at december  interest sensitive within total over balance days days days years years in thousands rate sensitive assets federal funds sold and resale agreements   investment securities      securities available for sale       mortgage loans held for sale   loans  net of unearned income       allowances for possible loan losses       net loans       nonearning assets   total assets       rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing demand deposits      savings deposits      certificates of deposits less than certificates of deposits more than iras      open time deposits   short term borrowings     long term debt     noncosting liabilities equity   total liabilities equity       gap      cumulative gap     the last two lines of the preceding table represents interest rate sensitivity gap which is the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
the interest sensitivity schedule reflects a negative gap at months  therefore  as of december  bancgroup generally has a greater exposure to net income if interest rates increase 
in reviewing the table  it should be noted that the balances are shown for a specific point in time and  because the interest sensitivity position is dynamic  it can change significantly over time 
for all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  variable rate assets and liabilities are reflected in the time interval of the assets or liabilities earliest repricing date 
fixed rate assets and liabilities have been allocated to various time intervals based on contractual repayment 
furthermore  the balances reflect contractual repricing of the deposits and management s position on repricing certain deposits where management discretion is permitted 
prepayment assumptions are applied at a constant rate based on the company s historical experience 
certain demand deposit accounts and regular savings accounts have been classified as repricing beyond one year in accordance with regulatory guidelines 
while these accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  experience and analysis have shown them to be relatively rate insensitive 
if these accounts were included in the day category  the gap in that time frame would be a negative million with a corresponding cumulative gap at one year of negative billion 
capital adequacy and resources management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to protect stockholders and depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
management s strategy to achieve these goals is to retain sufficient earnings while providing a reasonable return to shareholders in the form of dividends and return on equity 
the company s dividend payout ratio target range is 
dividend rates are determined by the board of directors in consideration of several factors including current and projected capital ratios  liquidity and income levels and other bank dividend yields and payment ratios 
the amount of a cash dividend  if any  rests with the discretion of the board of directors of bancgroup as well as upon applicable statutory constraints such as the delaware law requirement that dividends may be paid only out of capital surplus or net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding fiscal year 
bancgroup also has access to equity capital markets through both public and private issuances 
management considers these sources and related return in addition to internally generated capital in evaluating future expansion or acquisition opportunities 
the federal reserve board has issued guidelines identifying minimum tier i leverage ratios relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets 
the minimum leverage ratio is but is increased from to basis points based on a review of individual banks by the federal reserve 
the minimum risk adjusted capital ratios established by the federal reserve are for tier i and for total capital 
bancgroup s actual capital ratios and the components of capital and risk adjusted asset information subject to regulatory review as of december  are stated below capital thousands tier i capital shareholders equity excluding unrealized gain on securities available for sale  disallowed msrs and intangibles plus trust preferred securities  tier ii capital allowable loan loss reserve  subordinated debt  total capital  risk adjusted assets thousands  total assets thousands  tier i leverage ratio risk adjusted capital ratios tier i capital ratio total capital ratio bancgroup has increased capital gradually through normal earnings retention as well as through stock registrations to capitalize acquisitions 
the decreases in the risk adjusted ratios shown above are primarily due to asset growth and the repurchase of million in bancgroup stock 
asset growth was partially funded by approximately million in capital available as a result of exiting the mortgage servicing business
