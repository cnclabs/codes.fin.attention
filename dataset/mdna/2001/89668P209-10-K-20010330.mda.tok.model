our actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed in item business  as well as cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements  risks related to our financial condition and our business and risks related to our industry  below  and other factors relating to our business and us that are not historical facts 
factors that may affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  our limited operating history and cumulative losses  uncertainty of customer demand  rapid expansion  potential software failures and errors  potential network and interconnection failure  dependence on local exchange carriers  dependence on third party vendors  dependence on key personnel  uncertainty of government regulation  legal and regulatory uncertainties  and competition 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
overview we are an emerging provider of advanced  integrated telecommunications services targeted primarily to residential subscribers 
for management purposes  we are organized into one reportable operating segment 
we offer local and long distance telephone services in combination with enhanced communication features accessible through the telephone or the internet 
the nature of our business is rapidly evolving  and we have a limited operating history 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results  including our network operations and other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we do not believe that our historical growth rates are indicative of future results 
z line home edition is our principal service offering 
z line home edition includes low priced local and long distance residential telephone services using a customer s existing telephone number  bundled with enhanced features  including caller identification  call forwarding  three way calling  speed calling  and remote access to long distance calling through our z line anywhere access card service  the full functionality of the z line features and  for an additional fee  internet access 
we offer z line home edition service  at least on an initial marketing basis  in the following seventeen states alabama  arizona  california  florida  georgia  illinois  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new york  oregon  pennsylvania  texas  virginia  and washington 
we also intend to offer to all of our z line home edition subscribers the ability  through our city of america program  to make unlimited long distance telephone calls to other z line home edition subscribers for an additional monthly fee 
we intend to continue to pursue offering z line home edition in additional states as soon as favorable pricing and implementation rules are imposed in those states 
we are also developing other bundled combinations of our services at varied price points in order to stimulate and expand customer interest in our services 
for example  we have begun to offer in five states a lower price version of z line home edition that includes fewer bundled long distance minutes and features 
additional long distance minutes and features are being offered separately for an additional monthly fee 
z line anywhere is our access card service that allows a customer to make long distance calls using our network from any phone simply by dialing a local access or toll free number 
no change in phone service is required 
subscribers of z line anywhere also receive the full functionality of our z line features 
z line anywhere customers are billed monthly in arrears  and the associated revenue is recognized in the month of service 
z line anywhere is available nationwide  although we are not actively marketing the service 
touch long distance is a usage based service that allows customers to use us as their primary long distance calling provider to complete their residential long distance calls 
touch long distance is available nationwide  although we are not actively marketing the service 
we completed the acquisition of touch communications  inc touch  on april  the purchase price of touch consisted of million shares of our common stock and million in cash 
touch provides employees in sales  provisioning  and customer service 
we anticipate that this acquisition will provide operating efficiencies and lower customer acquisition costs 
we believe that touch also has provided us with the opportunity to further grow our back office operations to provide capacity for market entry into new states 
we used the purchase accounting method for our acquisition of touch therefore  the below discussions of the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources do not include any discussions regarding touch prior to our acquisition of touch  which is treated as being closed for accounting purposes  on april  this treatment is in accordance with the adoption of the purchase method of accounting 
a pro forma discussion and schedule is included in footnote to the financial statements  which displays the pro forma operations information of us and touch for the years ended december  and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
the increase is attributable to the average home edition customer count of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the purchase of touch provided an additional increase in revenue of million from its existing long distance offering for the year ended december  the following tables outline the approximate number of subscriber lines for z line home edition  z line anywhere and touch long distance services as of the end of the period type of service december  december  z line home edition   z line anywhere and touch long distance services   network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
the gross margin increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the network operations expense primarily consists of fixed and variable transmission expenses for interconnection agreements with incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  service level agreements with inter exchange carriers ixcs  and transmission services based on tariff arrangements 
the increase in network operation expenses and improved margins is the result of our subscriber growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
the sales and marketing expense primarily consists of telemarketing  direct mail  brand awareness advertising  agent commission and salaries and benefits paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to entering new states more rapidly than anticipated  which drove increased telemarketing  direct mail efforts  and brand awareness 
we also launched a marketing campaign for our city of america service that provides unlimited calling between z line home edition members  for an additional monthly fee 
this campaign has been introduced in texas and is expected to be rolled out to all of the other states in which we offer z line home edition service 
we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts toward lower acquisition costs per subscriber for we have reduced our direct mail campaigns that resulted in higher than anticipated acquisition costs 
we believe the roll out of the city of america campaign to all states in which we offer z line home edition  coupled with the introduction of our online sales channel and electronic agent program  should contribute to lower acquisition costs 
we will continue to build our overall awareness of our z brand  and continue to explore alliances and ventures with other companies 
although acquisition cost is expected to decrease per subscriber in  the overall sales and marketing expenditures will increase over last year as a result of increased subscribers 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits paid to employees engaged in research and development activities and outside third party development costs 
the enhancement of our current product offerings  development of new products and services and internal use software development have contributed to increased research and development costs for the year ended december  we introduced z alerts during and will continue to develop new product offerings 
we adopted the provisions of statement of position sop  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  at the beginning of as a result  and million of salary and related costs for research and development relating to the development of internal use software was capitalized  rather than expensed  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development will continue to play an important role in our operations and customer support 
we built an electronic gateway that was substantially completed in december that will increase our efficiency to provision and perform other services for our customers in this technology improvement led to a staff reduction in that should decrease some payroll related general and administrative expenses 
in addition to assisting with operations  our research and development team is working to develop speech recognition and other new service offerings and pricing plans which provide customers with more options and reasons to become and remain our customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
increased expenses in employee salaries  temporary services  bad debt expense  billing and collection expense  occupancy costs  and provisioning costs were necessary to support the growth we experienced 
the acquisition of touch and an increase of approximately  net subscriber lines in contributed to increased general and administrative expense 
we increased our capacity for back office operations to provide for our growth  and introduced our z line home edition offering to eleven new states in the later than expected implementation of our electronic gateway and the overall increase in bad debts from increased customers were all contributing factors to our increased general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate general and administrative expenditures will continue to increase in the future to support our increase in subscriber lines  expanding services and entrance into new states 
we have experienced an improved operating efficiency from the development of our electronic gateway and other improvements to our customer provisioning  customer billing  and collection efforts 
we expect these efforts will provide us with efficiencies that will allow us to provide an overall reduced cost per subscriber 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is a result of the acquisition of touch and our purchases of equipment 
intangible assets  which are composed of million and million allocated to customer lists and goodwill  respectively  and amortized over and year lives  respectively  resulted in amortization of million for the year ended december  in addition  the purchase of computer equipment  switching equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements required to maintain our growth and expand our operations has also contributed to the increased depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  although we are not a facilities based provider  we expect incremental increases to depreciation and amortization to continue to increase as our subscriber base increases 
interest and other income 
interest and other income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
interest and other income consists of income from interest earned from our cash balance and any gains from the sale of investments or securities 
the increase was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of an equity investment in the remaining increase in is a result of larger cash reserves from our initial public offering and our series d and e preferred shares offerings 
we raised net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions in our initial public offering in late december  and net proceeds of and million in our series d and e preferred share offerings during  respectively 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
our interest expense is a result of the interest charged on our capital lease and other debt obligations 
we anticipate interest expense to increase in the future as a result of our assumption of debt from the touch acquisition and the borrowing of money to support operations through potential new funding sources 
income tax expense 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the year ended december  and last year 
net loss 
our net loss increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
this increase was due primarily to the increases in expenses described above 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
our net loss attributable to common stockholders increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to the increases in expenses described above and the issuance of the series d and e preferred 
in conjunction with the series d and e preferred we incurred million of non cash charges relating to net loss attributable to common stockholders in the non cash charges relating to a beneficial conversion  cumulative dividend and preferred stock accretion were composed of  and million compared to   and million  for the years ended december   and the period january  inception through december   respectively 
in november  the emerging issues task force application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments required that all beneficial conversions be calculated using the accounting conversion price method 
the company recorded a million cumulative catch up adjustment  included in the million beneficial conversion as a result of the securities and exchange commission requiring retroactive application of this method 
ebitda 
many securities analysts use the measure of earnings before deducting interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  also commonly referred to as ebitda  as a way of evaluating our financial performance 
ebitda is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles  is not meant to be a replacement for generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
we have included ebitda data because it is a measure commonly used in the telecommunications industry and is presented to assist in understanding our operating results 
our negative ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million last year 
we expect to achieve positive ebitda on a monthly basis during late second quarter or early third quarter of the positive ebitda will primarily be attributed to increases in subscribers and operating efficiencies 
comparison of the year ended december  and the period january  inception through december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  the following tables outline the approximate number of subscriber lines for z line home edition and z line anywhere type of service december  december  z line home edition  z line anywhere   network operations 
network operations expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  the increase in network operations expense was due primarily to growth in the number of subscribers resulting from the introduction of our z line home edition services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million compared to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception to december  the increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to our expanded sales and marketing efforts to increase our subscribers 
we increased our telemarketing and advertising expenses in in connection with the introduction of our z line home edition service 
to meet the demands of our growth we increased our personnel in this department from approximately at december  to approximately at december  this increase is also attributable to the fact that marketing of our services did not begin in earnest until the fourth quarter of research and development 
research and development expenditures decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million  for the period january  inception to december  we adopted the provisions of statement of position sop  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  at the beginning of as a result  million of salary and related costs for research and development relating to the development of internal use software was capitalized  rather than expensed  for the year ended december   compared to for the period january  inception through december  in  we expensed internal software development costs  as we were developing our z line anywhere and z line home edition services and had not fulfilled the requirements for capitalization 
the development of our z line home edition  and the integration of our customer care and billing software required significant expenditures from employee compensation and outside consulting fees 
these efforts were spent adding functionality and making significant enhancements to our technology 
a portion of these services and purchases of software were capitalized in compared to  as a result of the adoption of sop discussed in the prior paragraph  causing research and development expenses to decrease in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception to december  the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increases in its primary components of employee salaries  temporary services  bad debt expense  and occupancy costs 
we increased the number of employees in general and administrative functions to employees at december   from employees at december  we increased our provision for bad debts during  primarily because of our increase in subscribers for the year 
we have implemented revised credit policies and are closely monitoring collection procedures to help minimize these expenses in the future 
we have increased our leased facilities utilized to meet our increased personnel and growing need for infrastructure to support our current and future needs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  the increase was due to purchases of equipment  facilities  and the capitalized costs associated with internal software development totaling million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  interest and other income 
interest and other income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  this increase was due primarily to the closing of two private securities offerings in and our initial public offering on december   which offering provided net proceeds of million after underwriting discount and commissions 
these transactions in provided for larger cash balances compared to interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  the increase in our interest expense is primarily a result of our payments on the cmb capital  llc sale leaseback agreement 
we anticipate a reduction in the amount of interest expense in the future due to the extinguishment of our cmb capital  llc million revolving sale leaseback credit facility on february income tax expense 
no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset for the year ended december  and the period january  inception through december  net loss

ebitda 
many securities analysts use the measure of earnings before deducting interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  also commonly referred to as ebitda  as a way of evaluating our financial performance 
ebitda is not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles  is not meant to be a replacement for generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
we have included ebitda data because it is a measure commonly used in the telecommunications industry and is presented to assist in understanding our operating results 
our negative ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period january  inception through december  liquidity and capital resources the competitive local telecommunications service business is traditionally considered to be a capital intensive business owing to the significant investments required in fiber optic communication networks and the co location of switches and transmission equipment in incumbent local exchange carriers central offices 
although we will continue our capital expenditures we do not expect the growth of our business will require the levels of capital investment in fiber optics and switches that existed in historical telecommunications facilities based models 
instead  we will devote significant amounts of our capital resources to continued operations  software development and marketing efforts that we have designed to achieve rapid penetration of our target markets 
we have incurred accumulated losses since our inception as a result of developing our business  research and development  building and maintaining network infrastructure and technology  sales and promotion of our services  and administrative expenditures 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  net operating loss carryforward of million  and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have funded these expenditures primarily through operating revenues  private securities offerings  a sale leaseback credit facility  receivables credit facility and an initial public offering of million shares of common stock including the underwriters over allotment option that raised net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions 
we intend to continue building our organization in anticipation of future growth and believe that our operating expenditures will also continue to increase 
on february   we paid million to extinguish the outstanding cmb capital  llc capital lease obligation and purchase the related assets 
this was the repayment of transactions involving the sale leaseback of various furniture and equipment payable over four years from the date of the transactions 
this transaction accounted for a million increase in the carrying value of our assets  resulting from the payments made to terminate the lease and the carrying value of our capital lease obligation 
this million was added to the value of the assets purchased and is depreciated over the estimated remaining lives in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for purchase of a leased asset by the lessee during the term of the lease  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on april   we completed the acquisition of touch for approximately million in cash and million shares of our common stock

we had payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million for the year ended december  our capital expenditures for were million  exclusive of million to purchase touch these outlays supported the addition of  z line home edition subscribers during our ongoing capital requirements will depend on several factors  including market acceptance of our services  the amount of resources we devote to investments in our networks  facilities  build out of additional enterprise management centers  services development and brand promotions  the resources we devote to sales and marketing of our services  and other factors 
we have experienced an increase in our capital expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and staffing

we have million of fixed rate related party debt that is primarily payable in monthly installments through we have a million balloon payment due in may and are in the process of attempting to re finance the terms of such debt 
we will make investments in sales and marketing to build our overall z brand and build awareness about our city of america and lower priced service offerings in an attempt to attract new customers 
we will focus on what we expect to be more efficient marketing channels such as our on line agent program and expect to lower acquisition costs per customer 
in the first quarter of we eliminated approximately of our workforce through a formal reduction in force  hiring freeze  and normal attrition 
we expect the above and other factors to result in the achievement of positive ebitda on a monthly basis during late second quarter or early third quarter of and positive cash flow from operations sometime thereafter 
we believe that we have sufficient funding to execute our current business plan  however  any acceleration or change to the business plan may require additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  or may be dilutive

we caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this document 
risks related to our financial condition and our business limited operating history 
we were formed in january and began offering telecommunications services to the public in september we have had fewer than three years of actual marketing  sales and operational results 
our limited operating history and results make it very difficult to evaluate or predict our ability to  among other things  retain customers  generate and sustain a revenue base sufficient to cover our operating expenses  and to achieve profitability 
as a result  we believe that our historical financial information is of little or no value in projecting our future results  making it even more difficult to evaluate our business and prospects 
uncertain demand 
we initially began to market our products and services in september in june  we focused our product offering on sales of our z line home edition service 
our products and services represent an emerging sector of the telecommunications industry  and the demand for our services and our ability to retain customers over time are highly uncertain 
consumer acceptance of our products and services could be limited by o the willingness of customers to accept z tel as an alternative provider of local and long distance telephone services and of other enhanced  integrated services  o the presence and attractiveness of other enhanced telecommunications service offerings in our target markets  o the perception of complexity in using our services  o the reliability of our technology and network infrastructure  o the quality of our customer service  and o the prices of our services 
we have determined that substantial marketing effort  time and expense are required to stimulate initial demand for our products and services 
in addition  we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial operating expenses  have made  and will continue to make  significant capital investments and have entered or plan to enter into real property leases  equipment supply contracts and service arrangements  in each case based upon our expectations as to the market acceptance of our products and services 
we cannot be certain that substantial markets will develop for our products and services  or  if such markets develop  that we will be able to attract and maintain a sufficient revenue generating customer base to cover our operating expenses 
lack of acceptance of our services in our target markets would materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our business  and as a consequence  the value of your investment 
in addition  to maintain our competitive posture  we must be in a position to reduce the prices for our services in order to meet reductions in local and long distance rates  if any  offered by others 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to match the reductions made by our competitors and  if we do  such reductions could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
expectation of future losses 
our product and service offerings are at an early stage  and we cannot be sure that sales of our products or services will generate revenues sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
therefore our operations may not become profitable within the time frame we expect or at all 
starting up our company and developing our communications technology required substantial capital and other expenditures and further development of our business will require significant additional expenditures 
availability and favorable pricing of unbundled network components 
our business strategy depends on a continued availability of unbundled network components and on existing and additional states maintaining and adopting favorable pricing rules for unbundled network components 
the public utilities commissions of certain states have adopted pricing rules for unbundled network components 
as a result of these regulatory initiatives  the bell operating companies operating in those states are required to offer to competitive local exchange carriers such as us  at forward looking  long run incremental cost based prices  the facilities and equipment and the features  functions and capabilities of their local exchange network on an unbundled basis 
we have commenced operations in seventeen states using unbundled network components 
however  given that the fcc order permitting unbundled network components is subject to further appeal  we cannot be certain that unbundled network components will continue to be available in their present form in those states or other states or that such other states will ever adopt favorable unbundled network components pricing 
further regulatory changes may adversely affect unbundled network components or our z line home edition strategy 
our business model is based  in part  on availability and favorable pricing of the unbundled network components  and any adverse changes in the unbundled network elements platform regulatory or competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid expansion 
we have rapidly expanded our operations since we were formed 
we expect to grow our business rapidly in terms of the number of services we offer  the number of customers we serve and the regions we serve 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage our efforts to o expand  train  manage and retain our employee base  o expand and improve our customer service and support systems and improve the performance of billing systems  o introduce and market new products and services and new pricing plans in addition to z line home edition and our other service offerings  o enhance and upgrade the features of our software  o capitalize on new opportunities in the competitive marketplace  and o control our expenses 
the strains posed by these demands are magnified by the start up nature of our operations 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
difficulties in expanding network infrastructure 
we must continue to develop  expand and adapt our network infrastructure as the number of our users and the amount of information they wish to access and transfer increases and as our customers demands change 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to develop  expand or adapt the network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing requirements on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
if we fail to expand our network infrastructure on a timely basis or adapt it to either changing customer requirements or evolving industry standards  these failures could cause our business to perform poorly 
ability to resell long distance services 
we offer long distance telephone services as part of our service packages 
we currently have agreements with various long distance carriers to provide transmission and termination services for all of our long distance traffic 
these agreements generally provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis and contain minimum volume commitments 
in cases in which we have agreed to minimum volume commitments and fail to meet them  we will be obligated to pay underutilization charges 
in some instances  if we incur underutilization charges  our basic rate will increase  which could further adversely affect our operating results 
risk of software failures and errors 
the software that we use and the software that we have developed internally and are continuing to develop may contain undetected errors 
although we have extensively tested our software  errors may be discovered in the software during the course of its use 
any errors may result in partial or total failure of our network  loss or diminution in service delivery performance  additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development or to add programming personnel to complete or correct development  and loss of revenue because of the inability of customers to use our products or services  which could adversely affect our business condition 
protection of proprietary technology 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to protect the proprietary information that we have developed 
our ability to protect our proprietary technology is limited  and we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
also  we cannot be certain that the intellectual property that incumbent local exchange carriers or others claim to hold and that may be necessary for us to provide our services will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  we might be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may be costly or not available on commercially reasonable terms 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our business 
dependence on information systems 
our billing  customer service and management information systems are newly developed and we may face unexpected system difficulties  which would adversely affect our service levels and  consequently  our business 
sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to our ability to monitor costs  render monthly invoices for services  process customer orders and achieve operating efficiencies 
we rely on internal systems and third party vendors  some of which have a limited operating history  to provide our information and processing systems 
if our systems fail to perform in a timely and effective manner and at acceptable costs  or if we fail to adequately identify all of our information and processing needs or if our related processing or information systems fail  these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our right to use third party systems is dependent upon license agreements 
some of these agreements are cancelable by the vendor  and the cancellation or nonrenewal of these agreements could seriously impair our ability to process orders or bill our customers 
as we continue to provide local telephone service  the need for sophisticated billing and information systems will also increase significantly and we will have significant additional requirements for data interface with incumbent local exchange carriers and others 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to meet these additional requirements 
network failure 
the successful operation of our network will depend on a continuous supply of electricity at multiple points 
although the system that carries signals has been designed to operate under extreme weather conditions including heavy rain  wind and snow  like all other telecommunications systems  our network could be adversely affected by such conditions 
our network  however  is equipped with a back up power supply and our existing network operations center is equipped with both a battery backup and an on site emergency generator 
if a power failure causes an interruption in our service  the interruption could negatively impact our operations 
our network also may be subject to physical damage  sabotage  tampering or other breaches of security by computer virus  break ins or otherwise that could impair its functionality 
in addition  our network is subject to unknown capacity limitations that may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our customers 
any interruptions in service resulting from physical damage or capacity limitations could cause our systems to fail 
network interconnection 
as a competitive provider of local telephone service  we must interconnect our network with the networks of incumbent local exchange carriers 
we may not be able to obtain the interconnection we require at rates and on terms and conditions that permit us to offer services that are both competitive and profitable 
in the event that we experience difficulties in obtaining high quality  reliable and reasonably priced services from other carriers  the attractiveness of our services is likely to be significantly impaired 
dependence on local exchange carriers 
we rely on incumbent local exchange carriers to supply key unbundled components of their network infrastructure to us on a timely and accurate basis  and in the quantities and quality demanded by us 
we may from time to time experience delays or other problems in receiving unbundled services or facilities which we request  and there can be no assurance that we will able to obtain such unbundled elements on the scale and within the time frames required by us 
any failure to obtain these components  services or additional capacity on a timely and accurate basis could adversely affect us 
anticipated capital needs 
if we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations  we may need to raise additional capital from debt or equity sources 
if we cannot obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  we may be required to modify  delay or abandon our current business plan  which is likely to materially and adversely affect our business and  as a result  the value of our common stock 
dependence on third party vendors 
we currently purchase the majority of our telecommunications equipment as needed from third party vendors  including lucent technologies  inc  sonus networks  inc  dialogic communications corporation  hewlett packard company  compaq computer corporation  sun microsystems  inc and emc corporation 
in addition  we currently license our software from third party vendors  including oracle corporation  inprise corporation  mercator software  inc  microsoft corporation  nuance communications  inc  speechworks international  inc  telution  inc  ams  inc  netscape communications  inc 
and accenture 
we typically do not enter into any long term agreements with our telecommunications equipment or software suppliers 
any reduction or interruption in supply from our equipment suppliers or failure to obtain suitable software licensing terms could have a disruptive effect on our business and could adversely affect our results of operations 
dependence on management and key personnel 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace 
if we lose the services of some of our key personnel  our business could suffer 
we currently maintain a  key man life insurance policy on the life of mr 
d 
gregory smith  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we also depend on a limited number of key management  sales  marketing and product development personnel to manage and operate our business 
in particular  we believe that our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel  including our engineering and technical staff 
if we are unable to attract and retain our key employees  the value of our common stock could suffer 
risks related to our industry government regulation and legal uncertainties 
we are subject to varying degrees of federal  state  and local regulation 
in states where we will provide intrastate services  we generally will be subject to state certification or registration and tariff filing requirements 
delays in obtaining the required state regulatory approvals may have a material adverse effect on our business 
challenges to our tariffs by third parties could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses 
we must also comply with various state and federal obligations that are subject to change  such as the duty to contribute to universal service subsidies  the impact of which we cannot assess on a going forward basis as the rates change periodically 
while we do not believe that compliance with federal and state reporting and regulatory requirements will be burdensome  our failure to do so may result in fines or other penalties being imposed on us  including loss of certification to provide services 
decisions of the fcc and state regulatory commissions providing incumbent local exchange carriers with increased flexibility in how they price their services and with other regulatory relief  could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of other competitive local exchange carriers 
future regulatory provisions may be less favorable to competitive local exchange carriers and more favorable to their competitors 
if incumbent local exchange carriers are allowed by regulators to lower their retail rates  engage in substantial volume and term discount pricing practices for their end user customers  or charge competitive local exchange carriers higher fees for interconnection to the incumbent local exchange carriers networks  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
incumbent local exchange carriers may also seek to delay competitors through legal or regulatory challenges  or by recalcitrant responses to requirements that they open their markets through interconnection and unbundling of network elements 
our legal and administrative expenses may be increased because of our having to actively participate in rate cases filed by incumbent local exchange carriers  in which they seek to increase the rates they can charge for the unbundled network element platform components 
our profitability may be adversely affected if those carriers prevail in those cases 
pending court cases  in which certain provisions of the telecommunications act of will be conclusively interpreted  may result in an increase in our cost of obtaining unbundled network elements 
we are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting slamming  which occurs when specific procedures are not followed when a customer changes telecommunications services 
although we attempt to diligently comply with all such laws and regulations and have procedures in place to prevent slamming  if violations of such laws and regulations occur  we could become subject to significant fines and penalties  legal fees and costs  and our business reputation could be harmed 
competition 
the telecommunications and information services markets are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  personnel  marketing  engineering  technical and other resources than us 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting our business operations will be price  the desirability of our service offering  quality and reliability of our services  innovation and customer service 
our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to maintain high quality  market driven services at prices generally equal to or below those charged by our competitors 
competitor actions and responses to our actions could  therefore  materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face competition from a variety of participants in the telecommunications market 
the largest competitor for local service in each market in which we compete is the incumbent local exchange carrier serving that market 
incumbent local exchange carriers have established networks  long standing relationships with their customers  strong political and regulatory influence  and the benefit of state and federal regulations that  until recently  favored incumbent local exchange carriers 
in the local exchange market  the incumbent local exchange carriers continue to hold near monopoly positions 
the long distance telecommunications market in which we compete has numerous entities competing for the same customers and a high average churn rate as customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives 
prices in the long distance market have declined significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
we will face competition from large interexchange carriers 
other competitors are likely to include incumbent local exchange carriers providing out of region and  with the removal of regulatory barriers  in region long distance services  other incumbent local exchange carriers  other competitive local exchange carriers  cable television companies  electric utilities  wireless telephone system operators  microwave and satellite carriers and private networks owned by large end users 
the telecommunications act of facilitates such entry by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to allow competing providers to acquire local services at wholesale prices for resale and to purchase unbundled network elements at cost based prices 
a continuing trend toward combinations and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry  including potential consolidation among incumbent local exchange carriers or competitive local exchange carriers  or transactions between telephone companies and cable companies outside of the telephone company s service area  or between interexchange carriers and competitive local exchange carriers  could give rise to significant new competitors 
the enhanced and information services markets are also highly competitive and we expect that competition will continue to intensify 
our competitors in these markets will include information service providers  telecommunications companies  on line service providers and internet service providers 
unauthorized transactions  theft of services 
we may be the victim of fraud or theft of service 
from time to time  callers have obtained our services without rendering payment by unlawfully using our access numbers and personal identification numbers 
we attempt to manage these theft and fraud risks through our internal controls and our monitoring and blocking systems 
if these efforts are not successful  the theft of our services may cause our revenue to decline significantly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently have instruments sensitive to market risk relating to exposure to changing interest rates and market prices 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and as such are not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we have no material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations  as substantially all of our long term debt obligations are fixed rate obligations
