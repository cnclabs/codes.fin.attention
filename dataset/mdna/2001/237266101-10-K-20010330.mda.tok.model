item business general founded by the swift meat packing interests and the darling family in  darling international inc darling or the company was incorporated in delaware in under the name darling delaware company  inc on december   the company changed its name from darling delaware company  inc to darling international inc 
the address of the company s principle executive office is o connor ridge boulevard  suite  irving  texas   and its telephone number at such address is the company is a recycler of food processing by products and believes that it is the largest publicly traded processor in the united states in terms of raw material processed annually 
the company collects and recycles animal processing by products and used restaurant cooking oil 
in addition  the company provides grease trap collection services to restaurants 
the company processes such raw materials at facilities located throughout the united states into finished products such as tallow  meat and bone meal and yellow grease 
the company sells these products nationally and internationally  primarily to producers of various industrial and commercial oleo chemicals  soaps  pet foods and livestock feed  for use as ingredients in their products or for further processing into basic chemical compounds 
commencing  as part of an overall strategy to better commit financial resources  the company reorganized its operations into three diverse  yet distinctive areas 
these are rendering  the core business of turning inedible waste from meat and poultry processors into high quality feed ingredients and fats for other industrial applications  restaurant services  a group focused on growing the grease collection business while expanding the line of services  which includes grease trap servicing  offered to restaurants and food processors  and esteem products  the business dedicated to using newly developed technologies to produce novel products from established supply sources 
due to unfavorable market conditions resulting from declining prices  in fiscal  the esteem product division was combined with the company s rendering operations 
prior year segment information has been recast to conform with fiscal in november  the company made a strategic decision to dispose of an additional segment  bakery by products recycling  a group which produces high quality bakery by products for the feed industry 
the results of the bakery by products recycling segment have been reported separately as discontinued operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding discontinued operations 
for the financial results of the company s business segments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s net sales from continuing operations were million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  net external sales by operating segment  including discontinued operations  were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal continuing operations rendering   restaurant services   discontinued operations bakery by products recycling total   processing operations the company creates finished products primarily through the drying  grinding  separating and blending of its various raw materials 
the process starts with the collection of animal processing by products fat  bones  feathers and offal  and used restaurant cooking oil from meat packers  grocery stores  butcher shops  meat markets  poultry processors and restaurants 
the animal processing by products are ground and heated to extract water and separate oils from animal tissue as well as to sterilize and make the material suitable as an ingredient for animal feed 
meat and bone meal is separated from the cooked material by pressing the material  then grinding and sifting it through screens 
the separated tallow is centrifuged and or refined for purity 
the primary finished products derived from the processing of animal by products are tallow and meat and bone meal 
other by products include poultry meal  feather meal and blood meal 
used restaurant cooking oil is processed under a separate procedure that involves heating  settling and sterilizing  as well as refining  resulting in derived yellow grease  feed grade animal fat  or oleo chemical feedstocks 
purchase and collection of raw materials the company operates a fleet of approximately trucks and tractor trailers to collect raw materials from more than  restaurants  butcher shops  grocery stores  and independent meat and poultry processors 
the company replaces or upgrades its vehicle fleet to maintain efficient operations 
raw materials are collected in one of two manners 
certain large suppliers  such as large meat processors and poultry processors are furnished with bulk trailers in which the raw material is loaded 
the company transports these trailers directly to a processing facility 
the company provides the remaining suppliers  primarily grocery stores and butcher shops with containers in which to deposit the raw material 
the containers are picked up by or emptied into company trucks on a periodic basis 
the type and frequency of service is determined by individual supplier requirements  the volume of raw material generated by the supplier  supplier location  and weather  among other factors 
used restaurant cooking oil is placed in various sizes and types of containers which are supplied by the company 
in some instances  these containers are loaded directly onto the trucks  while in other instances the oil is pumped through a vacuum hose into the truck 
the company also provides an alternative collection service to restaurants called cleanstar  which is a self contained collection system that is housed inside the restaurant  with the used cooking oil pumped directly into collection vehicles via an outside valve 
the cleanstar system and service is provided either on a fee basis to the raw material customer or as a negotiated offset to the cost of raw materials purchased 
approximately of the company s restaurant suppliers utilize the cleanstar system 
the frequency of all forms of collection service is determined by the volume of oil generated by the restaurant 
the raw materials collected by the company are transported either directly to a processing plant or to a transfer station  where materials from several collection routes are loaded into trailers and transported to a processing plant 
collections of animal processing by products generally are made during the day  and materials are delivered to plants for processing within hours of collection to eliminate spoilage 
collection of used restaurant cooking oil can be made at any time of the day or night  depending on supplier preference  these materials may be held for longer periods of time before processing 
the company charges a collection fee to offset a portion of the cost incurred in collecting raw material 
during the past year  the company s largest single supplier accounted for less than of the total raw material processed by the company  and the largest raw materials suppliers accounted for approximately of the total raw material processed by the company 
for a discussion of the company s competition for raw materials  see competition 
raw materials pricing the company has two primary pricing arrangements with its raw materials suppliers 
approximately half of the company s annual volume of raw materials is acquired on a formula basis 
under a formula arrangement  the charge or credit for raw materials is tied to published finished product commodity prices after deducting a fixed service charge 
the company acquires the remaining annual volume of raw material under non formula arrangements whereby suppliers either are paid a fixed price  are not paid  or are charged for the collection service  depending on various economic and competitive factors 
the credit received or amount charged for raw material under both formula and non formula arrangements is based on various factors  including the type of raw materials  the expected value of the finished product to be produced  the anticipated yields  the volume of material generated by the supplier  and processing and transportation costs 
competition among processors to procure raw materials also affects the price paid for raw materials 
see competition 
formula prices are generally adjusted on a weekly or monthly basis while non formula prices or charges are adjusted as needed to respond to changes in finished product prices 
finished products the finished products that result from the processing of animal by products are oils primarily tallow and yellow grease and proteins primarily meat and bone meal 
oils are used as ingredients in the production of pet food  animal feed and soaps 
oleo chemical producers use these oils as feedstocks to produce specialty ingredients used in paint  rubber  paper  concrete  plastics and a variety of other consumer and industrial products 
meals are used primarily as high protein additives in pet food and animal feed 
predominantly all of the company s finished products are commodities which are quoted on established commodity markets or are priced relative to such commodities 
while the company s finished products are generally sold at prices prevailing at the time of sale  the company s ability to deliver large quantities of finished products from multiple locations and to coordinate sales from a central location enables the company to occasionally receive a premium over the then prevailing market price 
marketing  sales and distribution of finished products the company markets its finished products worldwide 
marketing activities are primarily conducted through the company s marketing department which is headquartered in irving  texas 
the company also maintains sales offices in los angeles  california  and newark  new jersey for sales and distribution of selected products 
this sales force is in contact with several hundred customers daily and coordinates the sale and assists in the distribution of most finished products produced at the company s processing plants 
the company sells its finished products internationally through commodities brokers and through company agents in various countries 
the company sells to numerous foreign markets  including the european economic community  asia  the pacific rim  north africa  mexico and south america 
the company has no material foreign operations  but exports a portion of its products to customers in various foreign counties 
total export sales were million  million  and million for the years ended december   january   and january   respectively 
the level of export sales may vary from year to year depending on the relative strength of domestic versus overseas markets 
the company obtains payment protection for most of its foreign sales by requiring payment before shipment or by requiring bank letters of credit or guarantees of payment from us government agencies 
the company ordinarily is paid for its products in us dollars and has not experienced any material currency translation losses or any material foreign exchange control difficulties 
the company has not experienced any material restrictions on the export of its products  although certain countries  including india and certain middle east countries restrict the import of proteins and fats and oils made from porcine and bovine material  and the european community has restrictions on proteins and fats and oils made from specified bovine materials 
the bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse situation in europe and new fda restrictions  coupled with much lower prices for competing commodities  caused lower prices for some of the company s key products 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s export sales 
finished products produced by darling are distributed primarily by truck and rail from the company s plants shortly following production 
while there are some temporary inventory accumulations at various port locations for export shipments  inventories rarely exceed three weeks production and  therefore  the company uses limited working capital to carry inventories and reduces its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices 
competition management of the company believes that the most competitive aspect of the business is the procurement of raw materials rather than the sale of finished products 
during the last ten years  pronounced consolidation within the meat packing industry has resulted in bigger and more efficient slaughtering operations  the majority of which utilize captive processors 
simultaneously  the number of small meat packers  which have historically been a dependable source of supply for non captive processors  has decreased significantly 
although the total amount of slaughtering may be flat or only moderately increasing  the availability  quantity and quality of raw materials available to the independent processors from these sources have all decreased 
these factors have been offset  in part  however  by increasing environmental consciousness 
the need for restaurants to comply with environmental regulations concerning the proper disposal of used restaurant cooking oil is offering a growth area for this raw material source 
in marketing its finished products  the company faces competition from other processors and from producers of other suitable commodities 
tallows and greases are in certain instances substitutes for soybean oil and palm stearine  while meat and bone meal is a substitute for soybean meal 
consequently  the prices of tallow  yellow grease  and meat and bone meal correlate with these substitute commodities 
the markets for finished products are impacted mainly by the worldwide supply of fats  oils  proteins and grains 
other factors that influence the prices that the company receives for its finished products include the quality of the company s finished products  consumer health consciousness  worldwide credit conditions and us government foreign aid 
from time to time  the company enters into arrangements with its suppliers of raw materials pursuant to which such suppliers buy back the company s finished products 
seasonality the amount of raw materials made available to the company by its suppliers is relatively stable on a weekly basis except for those weeks which include major holidays  during which the availability of raw materials declines because major meat and poultry processors are not operating 
weather is also a factor 
extremely warm weather adversely affects the ability of the company to make higher quality products because the raw material deteriorates more rapidly than in cooler weather  while extremely cold weather  in certain instances  can hinder the collection of raw materials 
employees and labor relations as of december   the company employed approximately  persons full time in continuing business segments 
approximately of the total number of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  however  the company has no national or multi plant union contracts 
management believes that the company s relations with its employees and their representatives are good 
there can be no assurance  however  that new agreements will be reached without union action or will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
regulations the company is subject to the rules and regulations of various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
these include  but are not limited to  the fda  which regulates food and feed production  usda  which regulates collection and production methods  epa  which regulates air and water discharge requirements  as well as local and state agencies governing air and water discharge 
such rules and regulations may influence the company s operating results at one or more facilities 
the fda rule on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals took effect in august   as a measure to prevent the potential occurrence of bse in the united states 
the company s management believes it is in compliance with the provisions of the rule 
item properties the company s operating facilities consist of full service rendering plants  yellow grease trap grease plants  blending plant  edible plant  and trap grease plant 
except for leased facilities  all of these facilities are owned by the company 
in addition  the company owns or leases transfer stations in the united states and transfer station in canada that serve as collection points for routing raw material to the processing plants set forth below 
some locations service a single business segment while others service multiple business segments

las vegas  nv yellow grease trap tampa  fl yellow grease trap item legal proceedings litigation melvindale a group of residents living near the company s melvindale  michigan plant has filed suit  purportedly on behalf of a class of persons similarly situated 
the class has been certified for injunctive relief only 
the court declined to certify a damage class but has permitted approximately people to join the lawsuit as plaintiffs 
the suit is based on legal theories of trespass  nuisance and negligence and or gross negligence  and is pending in the united states district court  eastern district of michigan 
plaintiffs allege that emissions to the air  particularly odor  from the plant have reduced the value and enjoyment of plaintiffs property  and plaintiffs seek damages  including mental anguish  exemplary damages and injunctive relief 
in a lawsuit with similar factual allegations  also pending in united states district court  eastern district of michigan  the city of melvindale has filed suit against the company based on legal theories of nuisance  trespass  negligence and violation of melvindale nuisance ordinances seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief 
the court has dismissed the trespass counts in both lawsuits 
the company or its predecessors have operated a rendering plant at the melvindale location since in a heavily industrialized area down river south of detroit 
the company has taken and is taking all reasonable steps to minimize odor emissions from its recycling processes and is defending the lawsuit vigorously 
other litigation the company is also a party to several other lawsuits  claims and loss contingencies incidental to its business  including assertions by certain regulatory agencies related to environmental matters 
self insured risks the company purchases its workers compensation  auto and general liability insurance on a retrospective basis 
the company accrues its expected ultimate costs related to claims occurring during each fiscal year and carries this accrual as a reserve until such claims are paid by the company 
the company has established loss reserves for insurance  environmental and litigation matters as a result of the matters discussed above 
although the ultimate liability cannot be determined with certainty  management of the company believes that reserves for contingencies are reasonable and sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information currently available to management 
the company estimates possible losses related to environmental and litigation matters  based on certain assumptions  is approximately million at december  the accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities classifications in the company s consolidated balance sheets include reserves for insurance  environmental and litigation contingencies of million and million at december  and january   respectively 
there can be no assurance  however  that final costs related to these matters will not exceed current estimates 
the company believes that any additional liability relative to such lawsuits and claims which may not be covered by insurance would not likely have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  although it could potentially have a material impact on the results of operations in any one year

as of december   the company was in compliance with all provisions of this agreement  and the company has been in compliance with all provisions of this agreement  and has made all interest and principal payments as they have come due since the amended and restated credit agreement s inception on january  the company s management has been in discussions with the company s lenders regarding obtaining either new financing or extending the existing amended and restated credit agreement  but no agreement has been consummated 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments related to recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
if the company is not successful in obtaining new financing or extending the existing amended and restated credit agreement  the lenders could declare a default and attempt to realize upon the collateral securing the debt  which comprises substantially all the company s assets 
the absence of a new financing agreement or extension of the existing amended and restated credit agreement  creates a material uncertainty regarding the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
management is not able to predict what the outcome or consequences of these matters might be

as of december   the term loan was paid in full 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of  with sublimits available for letters of credit and a swingline 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  the revolving credit facility bears interest  payable quarterly  at a base rate at december  plus a margin of 
additionally  the company must pay a commitment fee equal to per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
under the amended and restated credit agreement  the revolving credit facility provides for a mandatory reduction of  on march   with the remaining balance due at maturity on june  as of december    was outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and the company had outstanding irrevocable letters of credit aggregating  substantially all assets of the company are either pledged or mortgaged as collateral for borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement contains certain terms and covenants  which  among other matters  restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of cash dividends  the retention of certain proceeds from sales of assets  and the annual amount of capital expenditures  and requires the maintenance of certain minimum financial ratios 
as of december   no cash dividends could be paid to the company s stockholders pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement 
the company has interest rate swap agreements which are used to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating rate long term debt 
at december   the company was party to three interest rate swap agreements 
under the terms of the swap agreements  the interest obligation on million of amended and restated credit agreement floating rate debt was exchanged for fixed rate contracts which bear interest  payable quarterly 
one swap agreement for million matures june   bears interest at and the company s receive rate is based on the three month libor 
a second swap agreement for million matures june   bears interest at and the company s receive rate is based on the base rate 
the third swap agreement for million matures on june   with a one time option for the bank to cancel at june   bears interest at and the company s receive rate is based on the base rate 
the company has recorded a liability of  at december   for the fair value of the portion of the two swap agreements described above which extend beyond june   the expiration date of the company s revolving credit facility  because they do not qualify for hedge accounting 
on december   the company had a working capital deficit of million and its working capital ratio was to compared to a working capital deficit of million and a working capital ratio of to on january  accounting matters the company will adopt financial accounting standard no 
on december  the first day of fiscal 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june  statement  as amended by statement  standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
upon adoption  the provisions of statement must be applied prospectively 
adoption of statement will result in the company recording a net transition gain of  in other comprehensive income at december  at december   the company has recorded a receivable from broker and deferred income of  related to the fair value of its natural gas fixed for float swap contracts in a gain position which qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a liability of  for the fair value of interest rate swap contracts in a loss position which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
upon adoption of statement  the company will report a derivative asset of  related to the natural gas swaps and a derivative liability of  related to the interest rate swaps 
the company expects that the adoption of statement will increase the volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income 
in general  the amount of volatility will vary with the level of derivative activities during any period 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in the annual report on form k  including  without limitation  the statements under the sections entitled business  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and legal proceedings and located elsewhere herein regarding industry prospects and the company s financial position are forward looking statements

among other things  future profitability may be affected by the company s ability to grow its business which faces competition from companies which may have substantially greater resources than the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the principal market risks affecting the company are exposures to changes in interest rates on debt and the price of natural gas used in the company s plants 
the company uses interest rate and natural gas swaps to manage these risks 
while the company does have international operations  and operates in international markets  it considers its market risks in such activities to be immaterial 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge adverse interest rate changes on a portion of its long term debt
