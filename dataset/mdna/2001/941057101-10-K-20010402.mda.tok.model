overview waste industries is a regional  vertically integrated provider of solid waste services 
waste industries was founded by members of the current senior management team in we operate primarily in north carolina  south carolina  virginia  tennessee  mississippi  alabama  georgia and florida  providing solid waste collection  transfer  recycling  processing and disposal services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
at december   we operated collection operations  transfer stations  approximately county convenience drop off centers  eight recycling facilities and nine landfills in the southeastern us we had revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december   and revenues of million and operating income of million in the year ended december  our presence in high growth markets in the southeastern us  including north carolina  georgia and virginia  has supported our internal growth 
from through  we acquired  either by merger or asset purchase  solid waste collection or disposal operations 
fifty four of these acquisitions were accounted for as purchases 
accordingly  the results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements only from the respective dates of acquisition and have affected period to period comparisons of our operating results 
the acquisition of eco services  inc and air cargo services  inc  which were both common control mergers  and the acquisitions of railroad avenue disposal  inc  reliable trash service  inc 
and dumpsters  inc  which were all pooling of interests transactions  have been included in our financial statements for all periods presented 
we anticipate that a significant part of our future growth will come from acquiring additional solid waste collection  transfer and disposal businesses and  therefore  we expect that additional acquisitions could continue to affect period to period comparisons of our operating results 
for the months ended december   we did not have any significant acquisitions requiring historical or pro forma financial statements to be presented 
current levels of population growth and economic development in the southeastern us and our strong market presence in the region should provide an opportunity to increase out revenues and market share 
as we add customers in existing markets  our density should improve  which we expect will increase our collection efficiencies and profitability 
results of operations general our branch waste collection operations generate revenues from fees collected from commercial  industrial and residential collection and transfer station customers 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial and industrial services that are performed under one year to five year service agreements 
our residential collection services are performed either on a subscription basis with individual households  or under contracts with municipalities  apartment owners  homeowners associations or mobile home park operators 
residential customers on a subscription basis are billed quarterly in advance and provide us with a stable source of revenues 
a liability for future service is recorded upon billing and revenues are recognized at the end of each month in which services are actually provided 
municipal contracts in our existing markets are typically awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and thereafter on a bid or negotiated basis and usually range in duration from one to five years 
municipal contracts generally provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contracts 
our prices for our solid waste services are typically determined by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged in our markets for similar services 
our ability to pass on price increases is sometimes limited by the terms of our contracts 
long term solid waste collection contracts typically contain a formula  generally based on a predetermined published price index  for automatic adjustment of fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs 
at december   we operated approximately convenience sites under contract with counties in order to consolidate waste in rural areas 
these contracts  which are usually competitively bid  generally have terms of one to five years and provide consistent cash flow during the term of the contract since we are paid regularly by the local government 
at december   we also operated eight recycling processing facilities as part of our collection and transfer operations where we collect  process  sort and recycle paper products  aluminum and steel cans  pallets  plastics  glass and other items 
our recycling facilities generate revenues from the collection  processing and resale of recycled commodities  particularly recycled wastepaper 
through a centralized effort  we resell recycled commodities using commercially reasonable practices and seek to manage commodity pricing risk by spreading the risk among our customers 
we also operate curbside residential recycling programs in connection with our residential collection operations in most of the communities we serve 
operating expenses for our collection operations include labor  fuel  equipment maintenance and tipping fees paid to landfills 
at december   we owned  operated or transferred from transfer stations that reduce our costs by improving our utilization of collection personnel and equipment and by consolidating the waste stream to gain more favorable disposal rates 
at december   we owned and operated nine landfills 
operating expenses for these landfill operations include labor  equipment  legal and administrative  ongoing environmental compliance  host community fees  site maintenance and accruals for closure and post closure maintenance 
cost of equipment sales primarily consists of our cost to purchase the equipment that we resell 
we capitalize certain expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects 
indirect acquisition and project development costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
our policy is to charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that we estimate to be recoverable  through sale or otherwise relating to any operation that is permanently shut down  any pending acquisition that is not consummated and any landfill development project that is not expected to be successfully completed 
engineering  legal  permitting  construction and other costs directly associated with the acquisition or development of a landfill  together with associated interest  are capitalized 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative overhead  professional services  costs associated with our marketing and sales force and community relations expense 
property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method 
other income and expense  which is comprised primarily of interest income  has not historically been material to our results of operations 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations

merger  start up and reorganization costs 
merger costs totaled approximately  and  at december  and and consisted primarily of professional fees 
we incurred nonrecurring start up costs related to deployment of service equipment and personnel associated with a new service contract of approximately  and  respectively 
these merger and start up costs had been expended at december  and loss on sale of collection operations 
we recognized a loss on sale of collections operations totaling million 
this sale was made in connection with the acquisition of collection and landfill operations to better align us for enhanced profitability 
interest expense net of interest income 
interest expense net of interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the higher level of our average outstanding indebtedness as well as a higher interest rate related to our purchases of assets of businesses acquired and the debt required to fund our stock repurchase plan 
income tax expense

as a percentage of revenues  net income decreased to in from in pro forma net income liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million and million at december  our strategy in managing our working capital has been to apply the cash generated from operations that remains available after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce indebtedness under our bank revolving credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
we generally finance our working capital requirements from internally generated funds and bank borrowings 
in addition to internally generated funds  we have in place financing arrangements to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs in as of december   we had fully drawn upon our three million term facilities with prudential insurance company of america  leaving us with an uncommitted shelf facility of million 
in we began principal repayments on the first million term facility 
the prudential facilities require us to maintain financial ratios  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
interest on the three prudential facilities is paid quarterly  based on fixed rates for the three facilities of  and  respectively  and the facilities mature as follows million in april  million in june and million in february  subject to renewal 
in november  we entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lending institutions for which fleet national bank  formerly known as bankboston  na  acts as agent 
this credit facility provides up to million through november virtually all of our assets  and those of our subsidiaries  including our interest in the equity securities of our subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the fleet credit facility 
pursuant to an intercreditor agreement with fleet  prudential shares in the collateral pledged under the fleet credit facility 
in addition  our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the prudential term loan facilities 
the fleet credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either a fleet base rate or at the eurodollar rate based on eurodollar interbank market rates plus  in each case  a percentage rate that fluctuates  based on the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda  from to for base rate borrowings and to for eurodollar rate borrowings 
the fleet facility requires us to maintain financial ratios and satisfy other requirements  such as minimum net worth  net income  and limits on capital expenditures and indebtedness 
it also requires the lenders approval of acquisitions in some circumstances 
as of december   million was outstanding under the fleet credit facility  and the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was approximately 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our prudential and fleet facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was caused principally by an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization and provision for deferred income taxes of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in working capital used in operations of million  offset by a decrease in net income of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was caused principally by a higher level of acquisitions of related businesses of million offset by proceeds received from sale of collection operations of million  and an increase in capital expenditures of million offset by proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
capital expenditures were million for compared to million in in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  including million for vehicle and equipment additions and replacements  approximately million for landfill site and cell development  approximately million for support equipment and approximately million for facilities  additions and improvements 
we expect to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds and borrowings under existing credit facilities 
as an owner of and potential acquirer of additional new landfill disposal facilities  we might also be required to make significant expenditures to bring newly acquired disposal facilities into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits for newly acquired disposal facilities or expand the available disposal capacity at any such newly acquired disposal facilities 
the amount of these expenditures cannot be currently determined  because they will depend on the nature and extent of any acquired landfill disposal facilities  the condition of any facilities acquired and the permitting status of any acquired sites 
we expect we would fund any capital expenditures to acquire solid waste collection and disposal businesses  to the extent we could not fund such acquisitions with our common stock  and any regulatory expenses for newly acquired disposal facilities through borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs  or long term care  or remediation of disposal facilities we operate or for which we are or might become responsible 
landfill closure and post closure costs include estimated costs to be incurred for final closure of landfills and estimated costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance of landfills 
we estimate these future cost requirements based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the environmental protection agency s subtitle d regulations 
while the precise amounts of these future obligations cannot be determined  at december   we estimate the total costs to range from approximately to million for remediation  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs 
our estimate of these costs is expressed in current dollars and is not discounted to reflect anticipated timing of future expenditures 
we provide accruals for these future costs generally for a term of years after final closure of any landfill  and will provide additional accruals for these and other landfills we might acquire or develop in the future  based on engineering estimates of consumption of airspace over the useful lives of such facilities 
there can be no assurance that our ultimate financial obligations for actual closure or post closure costs will not exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to insurance policies or trust funds 
such a circumstance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the total costs for remediation  final closure of our operating facilities and post closure monitoring costs  we cannot reasonably estimate any additional financial obligation  if any 
prepaid expenses increased million from million in fiscal year ended december  to million in fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in notes receivable acquired in acquisitions totaling million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased borrowings including capital leases net of repayments of million and a loan to liberty waste services  llc of million in  offset by repurchases of the company s outstanding common stock of million in at december  we had approximately million of long term and short term borrowings outstanding including capital leases and approximately million in letters of credit 
at december   the ratio of our total debt including capital leases to total capitalization was  compared to at december  seasonality our results of operations tend to vary seasonally  with the first quarter typically generating the least amount of revenues  higher revenues in the second and third quarters  and a decline in the fourth quarter 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the fall and winter months 
also  operating and fixed costs remain relatively constant throughout the calendar year  which  when offset by these revenues  results in a similar seasonality of operating income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks quantitative disclosures 
we currently utilize no material derivative financial instruments which expose us to significant market risk 
we are exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of december  our market risk exposure has not changed materially during the months ended december  thereafter total fixed rate variable rate qualitative disclosures 
our primary exposure relates to o interest rate risk on long term and short term borrowings  o the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants  and o the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on outstanding long term and short term debt through the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis
