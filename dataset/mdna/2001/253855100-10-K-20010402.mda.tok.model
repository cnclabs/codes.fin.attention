prospective and current investors are cautioned that such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements as well as the future prospects of the company generally  such investors should specifically consider various factors identified in this report on form k  including the matters set forth therein under the caption factors that may affect operating results  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may affect the company s results of operations include but are not limited to the company s anticipated fluctuations in operating results and seasonal sales  dependence on limited products  uncertain market acceptance of planned products  rapid technological change  dependence on new product introductions  dependence on the continued growth of the internet  competition  dependence on a limited number of customers  expansion into additional original equipment manufacturer relationships  dependence on contract manufacturing and sole or limited source suppliers  industry wide shortages of key components  management of growth  limited operating history and cumulative losses  dependence on key personnel  substantial influence of principal stockholder  dependence on proprietary technology  possible volatility of stock price  shares eligible for future sale  success in defending significant litigation  factors inhibiting takeover  and government regulations 
the company participates in a highly concentrated industry  and has limited visibility with regard to customer orders and the timing of such orders 
the company may also encounter difficulty obtaining sufficient supplies to staff and meet production schedules 
as a result  quarter to quarter and year to year financial performance is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of orders from its customers during fiscal periods 
overview digital lightwave designs  develops and markets a portfolio of portable and embedded products and technologies for monitoring  maintaining and installing fiber optic circuits and managing fiber optic networks 
network operators and other communications service providers use fiber optics to provide increased network bandwidth to transmit voice  and other non voice traffic such as internet  data  and multimedia video transmissions 
the company s products provide communications service providers and equipment manufacturers with capabilities to cost effectively deploy and manage fiber optic networks to address the rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth 
from inception in through  the company focused its primary activities on developing the necessary technology and infrastructure required to launch its first product  the network information computer 
the company had no sales until february  when it began shipping the network information computer 
as of december   the company had sold approximately  network information computers to approximately customers such as networks  ameritech corporation  cisco  level communications  lucent  mci worldcom  nortel networks  qwest communications  tellabs and verizon 
in  the company commenced limited sales of the network access agent 
net sales for the company were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products  less an estimate for customer returns 
net sales are recognized when products are shipped to a customer 
the average sales price asp of the network information computer was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average sales price asp of the network access agent was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company expects that the asp of its network information computers and network access agents will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the asp may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company primarily sells its products through a direct sales force to communications service providers and equipment manufacturers 
distributors are used for international sales 
the sales cycle for new customers tends to be long 
in addition  the communications industry historically has had a limited number of competitors 
given long sales cycles and few industry participants  sales of the company s products have tended to be concentrated  and the company expects that sales will continue to be concentrated in the future 
for the year ended december   the company s largest customer  telogy  accounted for approximately of total revenues 
for the year ended december   the company s two largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues  with telogy and technology rental services trs accounting for approximately and of total sales  respectively 
the company believes that a significant portion of the equipment purchased by telogy and trs is deployed at nortel networks 
for the year ended december   sales to the company s four largest customers comprised of its total revenues  with qwest  mci worldcom  tellabs  and gte accounting for approximately   and of total sales  respectively 
no other customers accounted for sales of or more during such periods 
many of the customers highlighted in years prior to as accounting for more than continued to purchase at similar dollar levels in although they did not surpass the threshold for this year 
there can be no assurance regarding the amount or timing of purchases by any customer in any future period 
see factors that may affect operating results we are dependent on a limited number of major customers 
in may  the company signed an original equipment manufacturer contract to provide integrated performance monitoring and diagnostic capabilities for a product marketed by lucent technologies  inc lucent s placement of orders for this product the wave agent is conditional upon the company achieving certain milestone events defined in the contract 
in january  the company announced that it had received an order for four waveagents from lucent for the initiation of customer lab trials 
these units were shipped in the first quarter of to date  the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products  but generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment and other cancelable purchase commitments 
as a result  the company does not expect to carry substantial quarterly backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
the company s sales during a particular quarter are  therefore  highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during the quarter 
consequently  sales may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing and amount of orders from customers  among other factors 
because most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed and cannot be easily reduced in response to decreased revenues  quarterly fluctuations in sales may have a significant effect on net income 
during fiscal year  the company incurred charges of million related primarily to the issuance of million shares of common stock as part of a legal settlement  million of which million is non cash as part of a legal settlement with a former stockholder  million in related legal expenses  and million in other special charges
