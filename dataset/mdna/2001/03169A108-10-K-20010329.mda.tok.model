statements which use the words expects  will  may  anticipates  goal  intends  seeks  strategy and derivatives of such words are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements  including statements regarding changes in the company s future income  mortgage asset portfolio  direct origination business  financings  ways the company may seek to grow income  income levels  the company s belief regarding future prepayment rates and future borrowing costs  and the effect on the company s interest income  interest expense and operating performance of changes in interest rates  are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statement 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the factors set forth under item under the heading business risks 
in particular  the company s future income could be affected by interest rate increases  high levels of prepayments  mortgage loan defaults  reductions in the value of retained interest in securitizations  and inability to acquire or finance new mortgage assets 
overview the company s revenue primarily consists of interest income generated from its mortgage assets and its cash and investment balances collectively  earning assets  prepayment penalty income  income generated by equity in income of american residential holdings  incand management fees 
the company funds its acquisitions of earning assets with both its equity capital and with borrowings 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with equity capital equity funded lending  net interest income is derived from the average yield on earning assets 
due to the adjustable rate nature of the majority of its earning assets  the company expects that income from this source will tend to increase as interest rates rise and will tend to decrease as interest rates fall  but only after the expiration of any initial fixed teaser periods and then only periodically once or twice each year 
for that portion of the company s earning assets funded with borrowings spread lending  the resulting net interest income is a function of the volume of spread lending and the difference between the company s average yield on earning assets and the cost of borrowed funds 
gross income from spread lending will generally decrease following an increase in short term interest rates due to increases in borrowing costs but a lag in adjustments to the earning asset yields 
yields on adjustable rate loans generally adjust based on a short term interest rate index  but the majority of the company s earning assets are adjustable rate loans which are subject to an initial fixed teaser period of two years  and then adjust periodically every six months 
gross income from spread lending will generally increase following a fall in short term interest rates due to decreases in borrowing costs and a lag in downward adjustments to the earning asset yields 
the company s primary expenses  beside its borrowing costs  are amortization of loan purchase premiums  provision for loan losses  losses on sale of real estate owned reo  management and administrative expenses and interest rate cap and floor agreement expenses 
provision for loan losses represent the company s best estimate of expenses related to loan defaults 
losses on the sale of reo represent a shortfall between sale proceeds and the net carrying amount of the property 
the carrying value does included a reduction credit provision to reflect an estimate of net proceeds at time of sale 
premiums are amortized using the interest method over their estimated lives 
management fees and administrative costs are generally based on the size of the earning asset portfolio interest rate cap and floor agreement costs are based on size of the portfolio subject to gap risk and the market prices for interest rate cap agreements 
during the third and fourth quarter of the company recorded approximately million of impairment charges related to its retained interest in a remic securitization the residual 
gaap requires that any decline in residual asset value that is other than temporary be reflected through the company s current period income statement 
decreases in interest spreads  along with higher than anticipated loan prepayment rates  caused the impairment 
the loans backing the residual were purchased  securitized in a remic and sold in june of there are no other retained interests in securitizations owned by the company 
one of the company s primary objectives is to diversify the income stream 
this would mean  less reliance on spread lending and more upon mortgage loan related acitivities 
several potential alternatives exist which would position the company closer to the loan orgination process and thereby reduce the premium for loan acquisition and improve the underwriting standards 
these alternatives may or may not be through a taxable entity 
one alternative in pursuing this diversity is to become a direct loan orginator 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s strategy will be successful or that the company will increase or maintain its income level 
results of operations for the years ended december  and december  the company generated a net loss of approximately and million  respectively 
net loss per share of common stock was and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the net loss in was in a large part due to an impairment loss on retained interest in a securitization see discussion earlier in overview section and spread compression 
spread compression in  was a result of a basis point increase in borrowing rates from in december of to in december of  which was not offset by a corresponding increase in asset yields 
the company s decision to not purchase new assets during the year has resulted in a decline in the portfolio balance 
a decline in the size of the portfolio has reduced the relative level of interest income although interest income increased in  there would have been a larger increase if asset yields had increased and operating cash flow available to fund new portfolio asset acquisitions 
net interest rate margin the spread between asset yields and borrowing rates may increase in if the recent interest rate reductions by the federal reserve continue 
asset yields are expected to increase by mid when the rates on the majority of the company s mortgage loans are expected to contractually increase  with a corresponding widening of the net interest margin 
however  with limited cash flow available to fund new portfolio acquisitions and the company s desire to deploy capital to build its mortgage loan origination capability  it is likely that the portfolio size will continue to decline  unless the company obtains new equity capital 
consequently  decreases in the size of the mortgage portfolio may continue to negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the net loss in was directly attributable to the write down of premium on bond collateral mortgage loans in the amount of approximately million 
these loans were purchased in and early when non conforming loans were selling significantly above par 
the growth in mortgage asset interest income of million  and the decrease in net interest spread of million between the years ended december   and december   were primarily due to a higher average portfolio 
net interest spread decreased as a result of higher average borrowing interest expense associated with increased borrowing costs not matched by increased mortgage asset yields 
net interest income increased million from the prior period ended december  this was primarily due to a premium write down expense of million taken during the period ending december  premium amortization expense represents the amortization of purchase premiums paid for mortgage loans acquired in excess of the par value of the loans 
premium amortization expense was approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  lower premium amortization expense is due to a decrease in amortization expense on the fasit protfolio offset by increased amortization on the and a portfolios 
additionally  increased levels of prepayments in the fourth quarter of on the cmo fasit segment of bond collateral mortgage loans lead to a premium write down of million in the fourth quarter of the following chart represents constant repayment rates cprs cpr rates life six three time months months december  bond collateral cmo fasit com cmo cmo remic a cmo n a cpr rates life six three time months months december  bond collateral cmo fasit com cmo cmo remic a at december   unamortized premiums as a percentage of the remaining principal amount of bond collateral mortgage loans were  as compared to at december  these levels are relatively low compared to at december  this is primarily due to the write down of premiums on the cmo fasit portfolio during the year ending december  the chart below provides a breakdown of prepayment coverage and the weighted average months remaining until the next interest rate adjustment for each segment of the mortgage loan portfolio percentage weighted average weighted average of loans with months remaining months until principal prepayment on prepayment initial interest balance penalties coverage rate adjustment dollars in thousands bond collateral  mortgage loans cmo fasit  com  cmo  cmo remic a  cmo  prepayment coverage is the number of months remaining before the prepayment clause in the mortgage loan contracts expire and borrowers may perpay the loan without prepayment penalty charges 
most of the intermediate adjustable rate mortgages in the cmo fasit and segments of the bond collateral portfolio have reached their first contractual interest rate adjustment increase and prepayment penalties on these loans have expired  resulting in a higher probability of refinancing and principal prepayments 
the company anticipates that prepayment rates on the newer mortgage loans will increase as these predominately adjustable rate loans reach their initial adjustments or when prepayment penalty clauses expire 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve or maintain lower prepayment rates or that prepayment rates will not increase 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if prepayment levels increase significantly 
during  other operating income increased approximately thousand over the year ended december  primarily due to an increase of approximately thousand in equity income from american residential holdings  inc a non consolidated taxable subsidiary partially offset by a decrease in prepayment penalty income of approximately thousand 
for the year ended december   other expenses increased approximately million over the year ended december  during the company incurred a loss on the sale of real estate owned of increased by thousand and management fees increased approximately thousand as a result of the company s mortgage loans having a higher average balance in than throughout mortgage loan balances have declined  but the average mortgage loan balance in was higher than in general and administrative expenses increased approximately thousand from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of adding employees  an increase in professional fees for legal work to expand state licensing  administration of reo and pursuing loan repurchases by loan sellers  an increase in computer software amortization and excise taxes 
the company held mortgage assets of approximately million as of december   comprised mainly of mortgage loans held as bond collateral 
this compares to billion as of december  comprised of mortgage loans held for investment  net pledged  of approximately million and bond collateral of approximately billion 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and the net loss of approximately million was primarily the result of premium amortization  a decrease in accrued interest receivable  and an impairment loss on retained interest in and provision for loan losses 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
the difference between net cash provided by operating activities and the net loss of approximately million was primarily the result of premium amortization and write down of mortgage asset premiums and provision for loan losses 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately million 
net cash was positively impacted by principal payments on bond collateral of approximately million  the sale of mortgage loans held for investment of approximately million  and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately million 
net cash used for the year was negatively affected by the purchase of mortgage loans in the amount of approximately million  and the purchase of interest rate cap agreements of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was positively affected by principal payments of approximately million  sale of mortgage securities of approximately million and proceeds from the sale of real estate owned of approximately million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
major components of net cash used include payments on long term debt of approximately million  decrease in short term debt of approximately million and payment of dividends of approximately million 
these cash uses were partially offset by the issuance of cmo bonds of approximately million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million offset by the payment of dividends totaling million 
net cash provided by financing activities was positively affected by the issuance of long term debt in the amount of approximately million and an increase in net borrowings from long term debt of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was negatively impacted by a decrease in net borrowings from reverse repurchase agreements of approximately million  payments on long term debt of approximately million and dividends paid of approximately million 
the financial condition of the company can be affected by turmoil in world markets as well as domestic liquidity problems 
as stated earlier  the company intends to seek new financing sources as the need arises 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure new short or long term financing or that financing will be available on favorable terms
