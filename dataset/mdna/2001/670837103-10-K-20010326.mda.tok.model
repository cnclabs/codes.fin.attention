item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis overview percent change from prior year thousands except per share amounts operating revenues   earnings available for common stock   average shares outstanding   earnings per average common share earnings per average common share assuming dilution dividends paid per share oge energy corp 
the company serves as the parent holding company to its two primary subsidiaries  oklahoma gas and electric company og e and enogex inc enogex 
this holding company structure is intended to allow the company greater flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in an increasingly competitive business environment and to clearly separate the company s electric utility business from its non utility businesses 
despite the continuing growth at enogex  the company s financial results and condition remain substantially dependent at this time on the financial results and condition of og e 
the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on the operations and financial position of the company and its subsidiaries during the last three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
trends and contingencies of a material nature are discussed to the extent known and considered relevant 
the company reported earnings of a share in  a percent decrease from a share in record revenues of billion were offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses and increased interest expense 
enogex contributed in earnings per share in  down from in revenues increased at enogex due to higher commodity prices and increased gas marketing volumes  as well as greater natural gas transportation and processing volumes reflecting the full year impact of the transok acquisition in mid the higher revenues at enogex were offset by higher gas and electricity purchased for resale  operation and maintenance including a million increase in under recovered pipeline fuel expense and interest expenses 
the holding company incurred increased interest expenses  which resulted in a loss of per share in  down from a loss of per share in the reduction in earnings in was partially offset by higher earnings at og e  which contributed in earnings per share in  up from in the increase in og e s earnings was primarily attributable to higher revenues from kilowatt hour sales to og e electric customers system sales due to more favorable weather in the last six months of revenue also increased due to the recovery of higher fuel costs 
as described in more detail below  the increase in revenues was only partially offset by state regulatory action that changed the generation efficiency performance rider gep rider and implemented the acquisition premium credit rider apc rider 
the decrease in earnings to a share from a share in was primarily the result of lower revenues at og e due to milder weather  lower recoveries under the gep rider and less revenue from sales to other utilities and power marketers off system sales 
the decrease in earnings was partially offset by significantly higher earnings at enogex  and benefits resulting from the company repurchasing million shares of its common stock in january the dividend payout ratio expressed as a percentage of earnings available for common shareholders was percent in as compared to percent in  within the company s desired dividend payout ratio of percent or below based on the current business environment 
future dividend action will be dependent primarily on two factors 
first  the appropriate payout ratio will be determined by the pace and structure of the deregulation of the electric utility business 
second  the payout rates will continue to be based on current and anticipated operating results 
the company s regulated utility business has been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility industry 
significant changes already have occurred in the wholesale electric markets at the federal level and significant changes are expected at the retail level in the states served by og e 
in oklahoma  legislation was passed in to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric industry with the goal to provide retail customers with the ability to choose their electric suppliers by july  in april  arkansas became the th state to pass a law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january   but the law was amended to delay customer choice until october  it now appears that customer choice of electric suppliers may also be delayed in oklahoma beyond these developments at the federal and state levels are described in more detail below under regulation  competition 
on july   the company  through enogex  completed the largest acquisition in its history by acquiring tejas transok holding  llc and its subsidiaries transok  a gatherer  processor and transporter of natural gas in oklahoma and texas 
transok s principal assets include approximately  miles of natural gas pipelines in oklahoma and texas with a capacity of approximately billion cubic feet per day and billion cubic feet of underground natural gas storage 
transok assets also include nine gas processing plants 
enogex purchased transok for million  which includes assumption of million of long term debt 
in december  the company announced that enogex s natural gas pipeline business signed two long term contracts with third parties to transport percent of the natural gas to fuel a new  megawatt power plant under construction in coweta  oklahoma  near tulsa in northeastern oklahoma  and to transport percent of the natural gas to fuel a new megawatt power plant under construction in jenks  oklahoma 
these two new facilities will be connected to the transok pipeline system  operated by enogex 
the new power plant in coweta  oklahoma is designed to burn up to million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
testing is scheduled to begin in november  with full commercial operation expected in june the new power plant in jenks  oklahoma is designed to burn up to million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
testing is scheduled to begin may and full commercial operation is expected to begin in january these are the type of growth opportunities envisioned by the company when transok was acquired in the company will continue to pursue these kinds of projects as deregulation of electricity and natural gas encourage further development of the energy infrastructure in our region 
forward looking statements except for the historical statements contained herein  the matters discussed in the following discussion and analysis are forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such forward looking statements are intended to be identified in this document by the words anticipate  estimate  objective  possible  potential and similar expressions 
actual results may vary materially 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the energy industry  competitive factors including the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets served by the company  unusual weather  state and federal legislative and regulatory decisions and initiatives that affect cost and investment recovery  have an impact on rate structures and affect the speed and degree to which competition enters the company s markets  and the other risk factors listed in the reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations revenues percent change from prior year thousands sales of electricity to og e customers   off system sales   enogex   miscellaneous total operating revenues   system megawatt hour sales   off system megawatt hour sales   total megawatt hour sales   in  approximately percent of the company s revenues consisted of the non utility operations of enogex  while the remaining percent were provided by the regulated sales of electricity by og e as a public utility 
enogex s primary operations consist of gathering and processing natural gas  transporting natural gas through its pipelines in oklahoma  arkansas and texas for various customers including og e  marketing electricity  natural gas and natural gas liquids and investing in the drilling for and production of natural gas and crude oil 
while the marketing activities of enogex represented billion of enogex s revenues in  this activity had relatively low operating margins and less impact on earnings than other portions of enogex s business 
revenues from the sales of electricity are somewhat seasonal  with a large portion of the company s annual electric revenues occurring during the summer months when the electricity needs of its customers increase 
actions of the regulatory commissions that set og e s electric rates will continue to affect the company s financial results 
the commissions also have the authority to examine the appropriateness of og e s recovery from its customers of fuel costs  which include the transportation fees that og e pays enogex for transporting natural gas to og e s generating units 
see regulation  competition and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of oklahoma corporation commission occ actions relating to these transportation fees 
operating revenues increased billion or percent during  largely attributable to significantly increased enogex revenues 
in  enogex s revenues increased million or percent largely due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from transok s operations and to higher commodity prices and greater natural gas marketing  transportation and processing volumes 
the integration of the transok and enogex pipelines has increased gas transportation revenue and provided enogex s energy marketing unit with a better platform from which to market natural gas 
og e revenues increased million or percent primarily attributable to warmer weather in the third quarter and colder weather in the fourth quarter in og e s electric service area and the recovery of higher fuel costs 
the favorable weather was primarily responsible for a percent increase in revenue from system sales 
the increased revenue from system sales was partially offset by a percent decrease in revenue from off system sales 
the decline in revenue from off system sales resulted from a reduction in both volumes and prices 
og e revenues were also adversely affected by the actions of the occ in lowering recoveries by million under the gep rider and implementing the apc rider  which reduced revenues by million 
og e s revenues in also were affected by a million annual reduction of its rates in arkansas  which became effective in august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these matters 
during  revenues increased million or percent due to a significant increase in revenue from enogex 
in  enogex s revenues increased million or percent  primarily due to a significant increase in sales volumes and rising prices in natural gas and natural gas liquids  the acquisition of transok in july million and increased power marketing sales million 
the increased revenues from enogex were partially offset by decreased revenues at og e 
revenues at og e decreased million or percent primarily due to a decrease in system sales and off system sales  both of which were higher in because of the record heat experienced in the summer of lower recoveries under the gep rider also contributed to lower revenues at og e 
expenses and other items percent change from prior year dollars in thousands fuel   purchased power   gas and electricity purchased for resale enogex   other operation and maintenance   depreciation and amortization   taxes other than income   total operating expenses   total other income expenses   provision for income taxes   total operating expenses increased billion or percent in  primarily due to increased sales volumes  rising commodity prices  and the full year impact of the transok acquisition in july enogex s gas and electricity purchased for resale pursuant to its energy marketing operations increased million or percent in as compared to million or percent for the increase was due to natural gas resale activity associated with transok s operations million  increased natural gas prices and increased volumes in the marketing of natural gas 
the increase was due to a significant increase in sales volumes of natural gas  the transok acquisition in mid  and increased power marketing sales 
other operation and maintenance increased million or percent in primarily because of the july transok acquisition million  increased natural gas purchases for operations million  higher employee benefit costs million and higher labor costs million 
the increase in expenses included million of under recovered pipeline system fuel expenses at enogex 
enogex has  among other actions  filed for fuel rate adjustments with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to recoup certain prior fuel costs and to more accurately recover fuel costs in the future 
in  other operation and maintenance expenses increased million or percent primarily because of expansion activities at enogex million and higher bad debt expense at og e million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced general corporate expenses million 
og e s electric generating capability is fairly evenly divided between coal and natural gas and provides for flexibility to use either fuel to the best economic advantage for og e and its customers 
despite this flexibility og e s fuel mix was percent low cost coal and percent natural gas in  fuel costs increased million or percent in  primarily due to a percent increase in the average cost of fuel burned for generation of electricity and a percent increase in total energy generated 
during  fuel costs decreased million or percent due to a percent decrease in total generation  which offset a percent increase in the average cost of fuel burned 
variances in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs  as compared to that component in cost of service for ratemaking  are passed through to og e s electric customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses 
the automatic fuel adjustment clauses are subject to periodic review by the occ  the arkansas public service commission apsc and the ferc 
the occ  the apsc and the ferc have authority to review the appropriateness of gas transportation charges or other fees og e pays enogex  which og e seeks to recover through the fuel adjustment clause or other tariffs 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
og e s purchased power costs increased million or percent in primarily due to a percent increase in the cost of purchased energy per kwh  which offsets a percent reduction in total energy purchased 
during  purchased power costs increased million or percent due in large part to emergency purchases in the aftermath of tornadoes  on may  and june   which inflicted heavy damage to the og e power supply  transmission and delivery systems 
in  the cost of purchased energy per kwh increased percent 
as required by the public utility regulatory policy act purpa  og e is currently purchasing power from qualified cogeneration facilities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million or percent  and million or percent in and  respectively  reflecting increased levels of depreciable plant  primarily property of transok 
interest expense increased million or percent in primarily due to increased long term debt at enogex as a result of the transok acquisition and due to interest costs on the trust preferred securities issued in october the proceeds from the increased long term debt and trust preferred securities were used to repay short term debt incurred to finance the transok acquisition 
in  interest expense increased million or percent due to higher interest charges at enogex and costs associated with increased short term debt incurred to finance the transok acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources the primary capital requirements for and as estimated for through are as follows dollars in millions electric utility construction expenditures including afudc non utility construction expenditures and acquisitions maturities of long term debt total the company s primary needs for capital are related to construction of new facilities to meet anticipated demand for og e s utility service  to replace or expand existing facilities in og e s electric utility business  to replace or expand existing facilities in its non utility businesses  to acquire new non utility facilities or businesses and  to some extent  to satisfy maturing debt 
the company generally meets its cash needs through a combination of internally generated funds  short term borrowings and permanent financing 
capital requirements and financing activities capital requirements were million in approximately million of the capital requirements were to comply with environmental regulations 
this compares to capital requirements of million in  of which million was to comply with environmental regulations 
during  the company s sources of capital were internally generated funds from operating cash flows  permanent financing and short term borrowings 
the increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable  in  are reflective of increased levels of activity by the enogex marketing unit and also reflective of the significant increases in the cost of natural gas at both og e and enogex 
short term borrowings were used during to meet temporary cash requirements 
at december   the company had outstanding short term borrowings of million 
on october   a million series of og e s percent senior notes matured 
og e temporarily funded this transaction through short term borrowings from the company 
on october   og e issued million of percent senior notes  series due october  net proceeds from this transaction were used to repay the temporary short term borrowings from the company 
og e acquired two gas turbine generators for use at its horseshoe lake generating station 
these two generators began operation on june and july  each generator can produce approximately megawatts of additional peak load generating capacity 
the total cost of this project was approximately million 
on july   og e reactivated two of its generators  which had been idle for several years  at its mustang generating station 
these two generators together produce approximately megawatts of additional peak load generating capacity 
the total cost of this reactivation project was approximately million 
together  these four generators at horseshoe lake and mustang increased og e s electric generating capacity by approximately percent 
as discussed previously  on july   enogex completed its acquisition of transok for million  which included assumption of million of long term debt 
the purchase of transok was temporarily funded through a million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of banks with bank one  na serving as agent 
on october   the financing trust subsidiary of the company issued million of percent trust preferred securities which mature october   and all of the proceeds were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement implemented in connection with the transok acquisition 
on january   enogex sold million of percent senior unsecured notes due january  enogex entered into a series of one year interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs associated with this million issue 
during  the effect of these swap agreements reduced the overall effective interest rate from percent to percent 
the interest rate swaps expired in january enogex used the proceeds from the issuance of this new debt to repay the company for the temporary short term debt associated with the transok acquisition and for general corporate purposes 
enogex used cash flow from operations to retire million of long term debt that matured in the third quarter of this debt consisted of million principal amount of percent medium term notes due august   million principal amount of percent medium term notes due august   million principal amount of percent medium term notes due august   and million principal amount of percent medium term notes due september  enogex is expected to continue reducing its outstanding long term debt during enogex retired million of long term debt in january future capital requirements the company s construction program for the next several years does not include additional base load generating units 
rather  to meet the increased electricity needs of og e s electric utility customers during the foreseeable future  og e will concentrate on maintaining the reliability and increasing the utilization of existing capacity  increasing demand side management efforts and  if necessary  purchasing power from third parties 
og e will continue to evaluate these strategies against the construction of additional peaking units or another base load generating unit 
these evaluations will consider  among other things  the amount of capital requirements and the relative cost of fuel supply  compared to other alternatives 
approximately million of the company s construction expenditures budgeted for are to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the company will continue to pursue a convergence strategy for its electricity and natural gas businesses 
this strategy seeks to maximize the value of the company s power plants and gas pipelines by coordinating  consistent with regulatory requirements  their activities through its marketing  trading and energy services unit 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company recently made several changes to its pension plan  including the addition of a cash balance benefit feature 
the cash balance plan may provide lower post employment pension benefits to employees  which could result in less pension expense being recorded 
over the near term  the company s cash requirements for the plan are not expected to be materially different than the requirements existing prior to the plan changes 
however  as the population of employees included in the cash balance plan feature increases  the company s cash requirements may be materially different than the requirements under the company s prior pension plan 
future financing requirements may be dependent  to varying degrees  upon numerous factors such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  acquisitions of other businesses  inflation  changes in environmental laws or regulations  rate increases or decreases allowed by regulatory agencies  new legislation and market entry of competing electric power generators 
future sources of financing management expects that internally generated funds will be adequate over the next three years to meet anticipated construction expenditures 
short term borrowings will continue to be used to meet temporary cash requirements 
the company has the necessary approvals to incur up to million in short term borrowings at any one time 
at december   the company had in place a line of credit for up to million  with million to expire on january   and the remaining million to expire on january  in january  the company s line of credit for million was renewed  with an expiration date of january  the company continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance shareowner returns and achieve long term financial objectives through acquisitions of non utility businesses 
permanent financing could be required for such acquisitions 
electric competition  regulation as previously reported  oklahoma enacted in april the electric restructuring act of the act  which is designed to provide for choice by retail customers of their electric supplier by july  various amendments to the act were enacted in and additional implementing legislation needs to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
if implemented as proposed  the act will significantly affect og e s future operations 
the stated purpose of the act is generally to restructure the electric utility industry to provide for more competition and  in particular  to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in oklahoma in order to allow customers to choose their electricity suppliers while maintaining the safety and reliability of the electric system in the state 
the act directed the joint electric utility task force  composed of seven members from the oklahoma senate and seven members from the oklahoma house of representatives  to undertake a study of all relevant issues relating to restructuring the electric utility industry in oklahoma and to develop a proposed electric utility framework for oklahoma 
the study was completed in neither the oklahoma tax commission nor the occ is authorized under the act to issue any rules on such matters without the approval of the oklahoma legislature 
other provisions of the act  i prohibit customer switching prior to july   except by mutual consent  ii prohibit municipalities that do not become subject to the act  from selling power outside their municipal limits  except from lines owned on april   iii require a uniform tax policy be established by july  and iv require out of state suppliers of electricity and their affiliates who make retail sales of electricity in oklahoma through the use of transmission and distribution facilities of in state suppliers to provide equal access to their transmission and distribution facilities outside of oklahoma 
the act was modified during the session of the oklahoma legislature to clarify certain ambiguities by defining key terms in the act 
as discussed above  additional implementing legislation needs to be adopted by the oklahoma legislature to address many specific issues associated with the act and with deregulation 
in may  a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was passed in the oklahoma state senate and then was defeated in the oklahoma house of representatives 
the company cannot predict what  if any  legislation will be adopted at the next legislative session 
the company will participate actively in the legislative process and expects the scheduled start date for customer choice of july   to be postponed 
in april  arkansas became the th state to pass a law the restructuring law calling for restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level 
the arkansas restructuring law  like the oklahoma law  would significantly affect og e s future operations 
og e s electric service area includes parts of western arkansas  including fort smith  the second largest metropolitan market in the state 
the restructuring law initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by january  in february  the law was amended to delay the start date of customer choice of electric providers in arkansas until october   with the apsc having discretion to further delay implementation to october  the restructuring law also provides that utilities owning or controlling transmission assets must transfer control of such transmission assets to an independent system operator  independent transmission company or regional transmission group  if any such organization has been approved by the ferc 
other provisions of the restructuring law permit municipal electric systems to opt in or out  permit recovery of stranded costs and transition costs and require filing of unbundled rates for generation  transmission  distribution and customer service 
og e filed preliminary business separation plans with the apsc on august  the apsc established a timetable to establish rules implementing the arkansas restructuring statutes 
the occ also has adopted rules that are designed to make the gas utility business in oklahoma more competitive 
these rules do not impact the electric industry 
the rules are expected to offer increased opportunities to enogex s pipeline and related businesses 
the efforts to increase competition in the electric industry at the retail level in oklahoma and arkansas have been paralleled and even surpassed by efforts at the federal level to increase competition in the wholesale markets for electricity 
the national energy policy act of energy act  among other things  promoted the development of independent power producers ipps 
the energy act was followed by ferc order and order  which facilitated third party utilization of the transmission grid for sales of wholesale power 
the energy act  orders and  and other ferc policies and initiatives have significantly increased competition in the wholesale power market 
utilities  including og e  have increased their own in house wholesale marketing efforts and the number of entities with whom they trade 
moreover  power marketers are an increasingly important presence in the industry 
these entities typically arbitrage wholesale price differentials by buying power produced by others in one market and selling it in another 
ipps also are becoming a more significant sector of the electric utility industry 
in both oklahoma and arkansas  significant additions of new power plants have been announced  almost all of it from ipps 
notwithstanding these developments in the wholesale power market  ferc recognized that impediments remained to the achievement of fully competitive wholesale markets including i engineering and economic inefficiencies inherent in the current operation and expansion of the transmission grid and ii continuing opportunities for transmission owners primarily electric utilities to discriminate in the operation of their transmission facilities in favor of their own or affiliated power marketing activities 
whereas ferc in the past only encouraged utilities to join and place their transmission systems under the operational control of independent system operators isos  ferc  issued order on december   its final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos 
order is intended to have the effect of turning the nation s transmission facilities into independently operated common carriers that offer comparable service to all would be users 
although adopting a voluntary approach towards rto formation  ferc stressed that order does not preclude it from requiring rto participation 
order sets out a timetable for every jurisdictional utility including og e to either join in an rto filing  or  alternatively  to submit a filing by october  describing its efforts to join an rto  the reasons for not participating in an rto proposal and any obstacles to participation  and its plans for further work toward participation 
og e is a member of the southwest power pool spp  the regional reliability organization for oklahoma  arkansas  kansas  louisiana  missouri and part of texas 
og e participated with the spp in the development of regional transmission tariffs and executed an agency agreement with the spp to facilitate interstate transmission operations within this region 
in october  the spp filed its application with the ferc to become an rto 
og e intends to meet its obligations under order and under the restructuring law in arkansas by joining the rto being formed by the spp 
the transfer of operational control of og e s transmission system to a ferc approved rto is not expected to significantly impact og e s financial results 
yet  it is expected to increase the markets in which og e can sell power at wholesale and  at the same time  to increase competition in such wholesale markets 
as a low cost producer of electricity with two of the most efficient power plants in the country  og e expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity 
as discussed previously  legislation was enacted in oklahoma and arkansas that will restructure the electric utility industry in those states  assuming that all the conditions in the legislation are met 
this legislation would deregulate og e s electric generation assets and the continued use of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation with respect to the related regulatory assets may no longer be appropriate 
this may result in either full recovery of generation related regulatory assets net of related regulatory liabilities or a non cash  pre tax write off as an extraordinary charge of up to million  depending on the transition mechanisms developed by the legislature for the recovery of all or a portion of these net regulatory assets 
the enacted oklahoma and arkansas legislation does not affect og e s electric transmission and distribution assets and the company believes that the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the related regulatory assets is appropriate 
however  if utility regulators in oklahoma and arkansas were to adopt regulatory methodologies in the future that are not based on cost of service  the continued use of sfas no 
with respect to the regulatory assets related to the electric transmission and distribution assets may no longer be appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes that its regulatory assets  including those related to generation  are probable of future recovery 
on january   the occ staff the staff filed three applications to address various aspects of og e s electric rates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters 
market risk risk management the risk management process established by the company is designed to measure both quantitative and qualitative risks in its businesses 
a senior risk management committee has been established to review these risks on a regular basis 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in certain commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company enters into various derivative transactions pursuant to the company s policies on hedging practices 
derivative positions are monitored using techniques such as mark to market valuation  value at risk and sensitivity analysis 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations and commercial paper 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the company may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues 
the following table itemizes the company s long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
year end dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt principal amount weighted average interest rate commodity price exposure the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions are the potential loss in value arising from adverse changes in the company s commodity prices 
the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and electricity are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  the company may hedge through the utilization of derivatives a portion of the company s supply and related purchase and sale contracts  as well as any anticipated transactions purchases and sales 
see price risk management activities in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special studies other than monitoring the degree of correlation between the derivative and cash markets are deemed necessary 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the price exposure to the market risk of the company s natural gas  natural gas liquids and electricity commodity positions 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of natural gas inventories  purchased electric capacity  commodity purchase and sales contracts  and derivative financial and commodity instruments 
the fair value of such position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in such prices over the next months 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows for fiscal dollars in thousands wholesale non trading commodity market risk  net   in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  with an effective date for periods beginning after june  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 

as a result of sfas no

is now required for financial statements for periods beginning after june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which amends the accounting and reporting standards of sfas no 
for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
sweeps in a broad population of transactions and changes the previous accounting definition of a derivative instrument 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
during  the company established an sfas no 
implementation team that reviewed contracts throughout the company identifying both freestanding and embedded derivatives which met the criteria set forth in sfas no 
and sfas no 
the company adopted the new standards effective january  on january   the company redesignated all of its hedging relationships and recognized all derivatives at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
as a result of adopting these standards the company recorded a cumulative effect transition adjustment debit to other comprehensive income of approximately million 
contingencies the company through its subsidiaries is defending various claims and legal actions  including environmental actions  which are common to its operations 
the company s subsidiaries  primarily og e  also could be impacted by various proposed environmental regulations that if adopted  could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
for a further discussion of these matters  including a lawsuit involving trigen oklahoma city energy corporation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as to environmental matters  og e has been designated as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to a waste disposal site to which og e sent materials 
while it is not possible to determine the precise outcome of this matter  in the opinion of management  og e s ultimate liability for this site will not be material 
besides the various existing contingencies herein described  and those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s ability to fund its future operational needs and to finance its construction program is dependent upon numerous other factors beyond its control  such as general economic conditions  abnormal weather  load growth  inflation  new environmental laws or regulations  and the cost and availability of external financing
