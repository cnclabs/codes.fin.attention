overview the company  since inception  has incurred significant operating expenses devel oping its products and experienced substantial operating losses until achieving profitability in the profitability was driven by sales of synagis  the company s second generation anti rsv drug which was approved by the fda on june  and by the centralized european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea in august synagis is approved in the united states for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by rsv in pediatric patients at high risk for rsv disease 
because of the seasonal nature of rsv  limited sales  if any  are expected during the second and third quarters of any calenda r year  causing results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
synagis sales for the rsv season totaled mi llion 
the company also markets cytogam for the attenuation of primary cmv disease in kidney  lung  liver  pancreas and heart t ransplant patients and respigam for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv in children under mo nths of age with bpd or a history of prematurity 
respigam  the company s first generation anti rsv drug  has been largely replac ed in the marketplace by synagis 
in november  the company completed a merger with us bioscience  inc u sb  now known as medimmune oncology  inc  in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a consequence  histori cal results of medimmune and usb have been combined 
in addition to gaining clinical  marketing and sales personnel specializing in oncology  the company also added three approved products to its product portfolio  including two oncology products 
ethyol was made commercially available by the company s united states distribution partner  alza corporation alza  in march ethyol was approved by the fda in december as a selective cytoprotective agent to reduce the cumulative renal kidney toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer 
in  the label was expanded to i nclude patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc 
the label was further expanded in june to include the preventi on of severe dry mouth caused by post operative radiation treatment in certain head and neck cancer patients 
neutrexin  introd uced in january  is approved for concurrent use with leucovorin administration leucovorin protection as an alternative therap y for the treatment of moderate to severe pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pcp in immunocompromised patients  including patients wit h aids 
hexalen  introduced in january  is a cytotoxic drug for use as a single agent in the palliative treatment of patient s with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer 
in november  the company sold this product to mgi pharma for approximately 
million plus future royalties 
results of operations product sales in millions synagis cytogam ethyol other products total compared to revenues product sales in increased to million 
the increase is attribu table to a number of factors including o an increase in sales of synagis  the company s largest product  w hich accounted for and of the company s and product sales  respectively 
sales of synagis in incre ased to million over sales of million 
increased domestic demand for the product resulted in a increase in unit volume 
a domestic price increase which took effect in the second quarter of also con tributed to the sales increase 
international sales increased to million in and reflect primarily an increase in unit volume of over the prior year  following approval of synagis by the emea in august the un it volume increase reflects greater demand for the product as well as inventory stocking by abbott international 
s ales made by the company to abbott may not reflect the ultimate demand for the product by the end users 
abbott interna tional acts as the company s exclusive distributor for synagis sales outside of the united states 
the terms of the com pany s agreement with abbott provide for the company to receive to percent of end user sales 
the company initiall y recognizes sales to abbott when synagis is shipped to abbott based on a contractual  guaranteed transfer price  this am ount approximates to percent of the total sales revenue expected to be received for each vial 
following the end of each quarter  abbott remits to the company a report detailing end user sales by abbott for the quarter and the compan y recognizes revenue for the additional amount due in excess of the transfer price and up to to percent of the en d user selling price 
as of december   the company and abbott international had filed international registra tions in countries for the approval of synagis  of which approvals in countries had been obtained 
there can be no assurance that approvals by the appropriate regulatory authorities will continue to be granted 
additionally  the company may not have received pricing and reimbursement approvals in countries for which regulatory approva ls have been obtained 
o an increase in cytogam sales to million  or over sa les of million 
the company believes that a portion of the cytogam sales that occurred in both years were as a result of product substitution occurring because of a worldwide shortage of standard ivig products 
during  the supply of standard ivig products increased  and certain medicaid agencies have begun to limit or discontinue reimbursemen t of cytogam as a substitute for ivig 
thus  the company believes cytogam sales for the period relating to pr oduct substitution have decreased significantly 
partially offsetting the decrease in the substitution business wa s a moderate increase in usage in transplantation 
overall  unit volumes decreased domestically and internati onally when compared to the year 
despite the unit volume decrease  sales dollars increased due to a domestic p rice increase of approximately implemented during the second quarter of  and due to a decrease in government r ebates paid for the product  principally for medicaid  related to the ivig substitution sales 
the company expects that future use of cytogam as a substitute for standard ivig products will be limited 
o increased sales of ethyol of approximately to million ov er sales of million 
ethyol is sold through distribution partners in the united states and internationally  t he company receives a percentage of end user sales and records all related cost of goods sold 
in  revenue for eth yol from alza  the company s united states distributor  was million versus million in the company achi eved an increase in sales volumes of domestically and internationally as a result of increased demand by the dis tribution partners 
sales made by the company to its distribution partners may not reflect the ultimate demand for the product by the end users 
in  the company estimates that end user demand for ethyol in the united states in creased by approximately 
the difference between end user demand and demand from the company s distributor represe nts fluctuations in wholesaler and distributor inventories 
in april of  alza exercised a one time option under the distribution agreement to extend its rights to distribute ethyol in the united states until april in a pril  the rights to distribute ethyol will return to the company and alza will receive a royalty from the company f or nine years based on sales of ethyol in the united states 
o sales of other products in increased million  or fr om the prior year 
sales of other products includes primarily sales of neutrexin and respigam 
also included in other product sales are sales of hexalen 
in november  the company sold this product to mgi pharma 
the level of future product sales will be dependent on several factors  includi ng  but not limited to  the timing and extent of future regulatory approvals of the company s products and product candidates  a vailability of finished product inventory  approval and commercialization of competitive products and the degree of acceptance of t he company s products in the marketplace

other revenues in primarily include million received under the hpv vaccine development collaboration with gsk and a payment of million from abbott upon european approval of synagis

the variation from the stat utory rate is also principally due to tax credits for research and development expenditures and credits earned for orphan drug status of certain r d expenditures  offset by the nondeductibility of certain merger related expenses
