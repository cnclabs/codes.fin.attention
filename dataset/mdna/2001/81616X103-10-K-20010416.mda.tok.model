this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of statements that are not of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  words such as may  will  expect  believe  anticipate  estimate or continue or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including those set forth above in part i  item under the heading entitled certain risk factors 
overview select comfort is the leading manufacturer  specialty retailer and direct marketer of premium quality innovative air beds and sleep related products 
since the introduction of our first air bed product in  we have focused on improving our product  expanding our product line  building manufacturing and distribution systems and growing our three distribution channels retail  direct marketing and e commerce 
vertically integrated operations and control over these complementary distribution channels gives us direct contact with our customers and gives our customers multiple opportunities to purchase our products 
sales generation is driven primarily by targeted print  radio  television  and internet media that generate customer inquiries  as well as by our retail store and internet presence 
since the latter half of  we have focused on five primary strategic priorities i building consumer awareness  ii rightsizing our cost structure  iii improving our sales conversion effectiveness  iv pursuing alternative distribution channels  and v continuously improving product quality  innovation and service levels 
each of these strategic priorities is discussed in greater detail above under business business and growth strategy 
the success of our strategy will depend on many factors and is subject to certain risks  including the risks and uncertainties outlined above under business certain risk factors 
retail operations included stores at december   including leased departments within larger stores  stores at january   including leased departments and stores at january  including leased departments 
during  we opened stores and closed stores 
in  we currently plan to open approximately additional retail stores  primarily in existing markets  and plan to close approximately underperforming stores 
the majority of the costs associated with these closings were accrued in the company reported comparable store sales growth of  and in  and  respectively 
comparable store sales results have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors  including levels of consumer awareness of our products  brand name and store locations  levels of consumer acceptance of our existing and new products  higher levels of sales in the first year of operations as each successive class of new stores is opened  comparable store sales performance in prior periods  the maturation of our store base  the amount  timing and relative success of promotional events  advertising expenditures  new product introductions and product line extensions  the quality and tenure of store level managers and sales professionals  the amount of competitive activity  the evolution of store operations  changes in the sales mix between our distribution channels  and general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
advertising expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred as a component of sales and marketing expenses  although we believe that advertising expenditures provide significant benefits beyond the period in which they are expensed 
future advertising expenditures will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of the advertising in creating awareness of our products and brand name  generating consumer inquiries and driving consumer traffic to retail stores 
pre opening costs associated with new retail stores are also expensed as incurred 
we believe historical operating losses have been primarily the result of an aggressive retail store opening strategy  a relatively immature store base  significant marketing  advertising and product development expenditures  and the development of a substantial corporate infrastructure to support future growth 
future increases in net sales and the achievement of long term profitability will depend upon greater consumer awareness and acceptance of our air bed products  improved effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing and advertising expenditures  the opening and successful performance of new points of distribution  improvement in the performance of current stores and our ability to realize the benefits of our cost saving initiatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain historical sales growth rates  or to achieve profitability in the future  on a quarterly or annual basis 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing  amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures  any changes in return rates  the timing of new store openings and related expenses  competitive factors  net sales contributed by new stores  any disruptions in third party delivery services and general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
our business is also subject to some seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the fourth quarter holiday season due to increased mall traffic 
a substantial portion of operating expenses is related to sales and marketing expenses  including costs associated with opening new stores  operating existing stores and advertising expenditures 
the level of such spending cannot be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on expectations of future customer inquiries and net sales 
furthermore  a substantial portion of net sales is often realized in the last month of a quarter with such net sales frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter  due in part to our promotional schedule 
should the company experience a shortfall in expected net sales or in the conversion rate of customer inquiries  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner and our business  financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future fiscal period 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million expiring between the years and we expect that approximately million of these nols will expire unutilized due to an internal revenue code irc section limitation resulting from a prior ownership change 
realization of the benefit of the deferred tax assets depends on us achieving profitability levels sufficient to utilize the nols

 net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expense sales and marketing general and administrative store closing impairments total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss before ext  net extraordinary item net income loss the operating loss in was largely due to a decline in net sales  and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the growth of our retail store selling infrastructure 
the decline in net sales was due to a number of factors 
advertising spending was reduced by million in compared to  as the efficiency of advertising programs declined and the company worked to develop new creative advertising programs 
additionally  seasonal traffic in our retail stores fell short of expectations  due in part to a softening economic climate during the fourth quarter of finally  direct marketing sales declined by million in compared to  primarily due to the continued migration of the company s sales from direct marketing to retail stores and due to the reduction of advertising spending in this channel 
selling expenses increased by million resulting in the net overall increase in operating expenses 
the increase resulted primarily from higher occupancy and compensation expenses resulting from an increase in the number of stores open for a full year in special charges of million are included in the results related to store closings  asset impairments and severance costs related to two reductions in workforce as noted above under overview and business business and growth strategy  we have implemented several strategic initiatives that we believe will result in improved operating results in comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales in decreased to million from million in the components of the decrease in net sales were i a million increase from the opening of new retail stores during and the full year impact of stores opened in  ii a million increase from a increase in comparable store sales  iii a million increase in net sales from the company s e commerce channel  offset by iv a million decrease in direct marketing sales and v a million decrease due to the elimination of our road show distribution channel 
gross margin gross margin in decreased to from in primarily due to larger discounts on promotional offerings  increased costs from processing returned product and increased costs from the rollout of our new foundation product  partially offset by a price increase for some of our products 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses in increased to million from million in  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses during was primarily due to i higher occupancy expense related primarily to rent and depreciation expense  ii higher wages and compensation expense and iii higher freight costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to i lower direct marketing sales and ii selling expenses in new stores increasing at a greater rate than net sales and the expenses associated with the rollout of our sofa sleeper product  partially offset by iii a decrease in media spending 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses in were million  equal to the expense level 
slight increases in wages and benefits expense were offset by reductions in the use of outside services and consultants 
store closings impairments store closing impairment expense in was million  up from million in in  this expense included million related to the relocation of our headquarter offices and web development costs and million related to store closures 
the expense of million in relates almost exclusively to store closures 
other income expense  net other income decreased million to approximately million of other income in from million in other income in the decrease is due to lower cash levels affecting interest income in in addition  the recognition of an equity loss in sleeptec following our acquisition of this business reduced other income by 
million 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense increased to million for from a benefit of million for income tax expense increased as a result of the establishment of an additional million deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of resulting from uncertainties in the company s business 
see liquidity and capital resources 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal net sales net sales in increased to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in unit sales 
the components of the increase in net sales were i a million increase from the opening of new retail stores during and the full year impact of stores opened in  ii a million increase from a increase in comparable store sales  due in part to the continuing maturation of stores and increased advertising in selected markets  iii a million increase in net sales from the company s newly developed e commerce channel  partially offset by iv a million decrease in direct marketing sales 
gross margin gross margin in decreased to from in reductions in cost of sales from improved purchasing and leverage of fixed manufacturing costs over higher unit volumes were offset by higher sales discounts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses in increased to million from million in  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the increase in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses during was primarily due to i the opening of new retail stores  ii an increase in advertising expenditures of million and iii higher commissions  percentage rents and freight expense related to higher net sales 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of net sales primarily due to i increased advertising focused on longer term sales growth through brand and retail store awareness  ii lower direct marketing sales and iii selling expenses in new stores increasing at a greater rate than net sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased spending on infrastructure to support long term growth plans and strategic consulting studies undertaken to determine and refine ongoing business strategies 
store closings store closing expense in was million  compared with  in store closing expense for includes a million charge associated with plans to close stores and other related store write offs 
other income expense  net other income increased million to approximately million of other income in from million in other expense in the increase was primarily due to i the inclusion of million of non cash interest expense in relating to the change in the fair value of an outstanding put warrant and ii an increase in interest income on the cash obtained from the completion of our initial public offering in december the put provision associated with the warrant was eliminated effective on completion of the initial public offering 
income tax expense benefit income tax benefit increased to million in from million in due to a decrease in taxable income in extraordinary item net income in includes an extraordinary charge  net of income tax benefits  of million 
the charge relates to the write off of certain deferred assets associated with our million debt financing  which was repaid in december liquidity and capital resources the report of our independent accountants contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern as a result of our negative cash flows 
the company has incurred pre tax losses from operations of million and million in and  respectively  and had negative working capital of million at december  as a result of fiscal operating losses and the recent downturn in the economy  which has adversely affected our sales trends  our current cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs 
our near term cash needs are further impacted by i the seasonality of our business  with lower sales volumes historically occurring during the second quarter  ii the timing of marketing and advertising expenditures  which are higher in the early part of the year when direct marketing advertising rates are more favorable  and iii working capital needs as we expand our wholesale activities through a significant qvc sales event planned for may 
based on the estimated cash impact of the items outlined above  offset in part by more aggressive efforts to manage our working capital needs  we estimate that between million and million of additional working capital is required during the second and third quarters 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have undertaken efforts to substantially reduce our cost structure as outlined above in business business and growth strategy 
following the recent downturn in the economy and evaluation of the related impact on our anticipated sales volumes  we implemented further cost saving initiatives 
we expect that these cost reductions  along with efforts to increase our product and brand awareness  improve our sales conversion effectiveness and expand our points of distribution  will result in positive cash flows from operations for the balance of fiscal since the fourth quarter of  we have been pursuing million or more of working capital financing from a variety of potential sources 
due to our traditional business model  under which we manufacture product to meet consumer orders and maintain minimal levels of finished goods inventory  the recent economic downturn  and recent tightening of credit markets  we have been unable to obtain traditional asset based financing 
we therefore have recently begun pursuing a private placement of senior secured convertible debentures in a minimum aggregate principal amount of million and a maximum aggregate principal amount of million 
the principal amount of the debentures would i be secured by a lien on the company s assets subordinated only to up to million of senior bank financing  ii mature five years after the closing  iii bear interest at payable annually in cash and iii be convertible into common stock initially at the rate of per share  subject to anti dilution provisions 
in addition  for each  in principal amount of debentures purchased  investors would receive detachable warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock of the company at an initial exercise price of per share  subject to anti dilution provisions 
debentures in the minimum aggregate principal amount of million and the related warrants would represent the right to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock and would therefore require approval of our shareholders under nasdaq rules in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq stock market 
the issuance of the debentures would further be subject to customary representations  warranties and covenants  including specified events of default that may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the debentures  as well as certain conditions to closing  including i the sale of debentures in the minimum principal amount of million  ii the receipt of binding proxies from holders of more than of our outstanding shares of common stock to vote in favor of the transaction  iii the receipt by our board of directors of a fairness opinion from an independent financial advisor and iv satisfactory due diligence and the execution and delivery of definitive documentation 
we have received non binding indications of interest from several potential investors for a significant portion of the minimum amount of this private placement  and we are continuing to have discussions with other potential investors 
we believe that we will be able to consummate this financing 
however  binding commitments have not been received and significant conditions to closing remain to be met  and therefore no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate this financing on the terms described above or on any other terms 
in addition to pursuing the financing described above  we have been aggressively managing our costs and cash flow to preserve and extend our cash resources 
near the end of  we began to undertake efforts to rightsize our cost structure 
the economic downturn at the end of adversely affected sales trends  resulting in the identification and execution of additional cost reduction measures 
efforts included termination of non core business initiatives  closure of certain facilities  including one of three manufacturing facilities  one of two administrative offices and one of two call centers  closure of stores in with plans to close stores in  reduction of corporate and administrative overhead and staffing  and adjustment of advertising  promotional and other marketing programs 
we are also pursuing programs to improve our liquidity  including negotiation of supplier and landlord payment terms  the reduction of inventory levels and the deferral of capital programs 
we believe that the financing mentioned above  or other alternatives that might become available  planned and implemented cost reduction efforts and the aggressive management of current and future cash resources will provide sufficient working capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain additional financing  or if our cash management efforts were not sufficient to preserve enough cash to meet our near term liquidity needs  we may not be able to continue as a going concern  which may result in material asset impairment or restructuring charges  other material adverse changes in our business  results of operations or financial condition  or the loss by shareholders of all or a part of their investment in the company 
historically  our primary source of liquidity has been the sale of equity securities 
we completed our initial public offering in december  resulting in net proceeds of million  which have been used for i the repayment of million of debt  ii expansion of retail stores  iii expansion of manufacturing capabilities  iv the repurchase of  shares of company common stock for million and v the development of information technology systems 
the company had negative working capital of approximately million at december   and positive working capital of million at january net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and consisted primarily of the net loss adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in income taxes receivable and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and consisted primarily of net loss adjusted for non cash expenses  decreases in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in inventories and income taxes receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities for was approximately million and consisted primarily of cash flows from operations before non cash expenses  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and decreases in accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities in was approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million in the years and  respectively 
investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment for new retail stores in all periods  and for also included the opening of our utah production facility 
in we liquidated million of marketable securities to support our continuing operations  while in we purchased million of marketable securities for the investment of excess cash on hand 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for  and was approximately million  million  million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from cash received from the issuance of common stock 
net cash used in financing activities for was due to repurchases of common stock and debt repayments  partially offset by cash received from issuance of common stock 
during  the company repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for consisted primarily of proceeds from completion of our initial public offering  partially offset by debt repayments 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments 
the counterparties to the agreements consist of government agencies and various major corporations of high credit standing 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties because we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and any one type of investment
