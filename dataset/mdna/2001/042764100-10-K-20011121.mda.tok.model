the technology acquired is a compact monitoring device that measures and monitors the descending aortic blood flow during anesthesia and intensive care 
the device provides real time aortic blood flow a measurement of cardiac output by using both pulsed doppler for measuring blood velocity and m mode ultrasound to accurately measure the aortic diameter 
the monitoring system consists of four main components the main console monitor  a transesophageal probe  a disposable jacket and an articulated probe holder 
the monitor provides the physician with a continuous display of a patient s hemodynamic profile  including aortic blood flow  heart rate  stroke volume  peak velocity  acceleration  left ventricular ejection time and systemic vascular resistance 
to facilitate use of this device  a disposable jacket  containing an acoustic gel  is placed over the probe utilizing a special vacuum mounting tool supplied with the jacket 
the company believes that the speed and ease of use of this new noninvasive measurement technique has the potential of establishing cardiac output as a frequently used physician tool with value similar to blood pressure  ekg and pulse oximetry fiscal compared to fiscal continued measurements

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and consistent with the company s accounting policy for marketable equity securities  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the decline in the fair value of its investment in cardiac pathways corporation was other than temporary 
accordingly  the company established a new basis in the investment at million  equivalent to its fair market value 
as a result  the company realized a special charge of million before tax  million after tax or per basic and diluted common share 
principally due to the above factors  operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses income  net  decreased to million of expense in fiscal from million of income in fiscal  due primarily to larger foreign exchange gains in fiscal and higher interest expense in fiscal aggregate foreign exchange gains in fiscal were million and in fiscal were million  including losses relating to foreign currency contracts of less than million in fiscal and gains of million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal continued as a result of the factors discussed above  income before income taxes increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal in fiscal  the company reduced its annual effective tax rate to from in fiscal due to final disposition of tax audits

during the third quarter of fiscal  the company completed a study of its fixed asset lives 
the study indicated that actual lives for certain asset categories were generally longer than the useful lives for depreciation purposes 
therefore  the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain categories of property  plant and equipment  effective march  the majority of the change in depreciation related to manufacturing equipment 
the change in depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment was included in inventory value and is being recognized as the inventory is sold  the change in depreciation expense related to non manufacturing assets is reflected in operating expenses 
this change in estimated fixed asset lives resulted in decreased depreciation expense of million and increased net income of million for fiscal basic and diluted earnings per common share increased by 
in fiscal as a result of this change 
basic earnings per common share increased to in fiscal from per share in fiscal diluted earnings per common share increased to in fiscal from per share in fiscal weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of the company s previously announced share repurchase program  which remains in effect 
liquidity and capital resources for fiscal  net cash provided by operations was million  a decrease of million from the prior year  due primarily to increases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses 
accounts receivable  net of the allowances for doubtful accounts  increased by million for fiscal  compared to a million increase in the prior year 
accounts receivable  measured in days sales outstanding during the period  was days at august  and days at august  the increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to sales to distributors which have longer payment terms 
in addition  as previously reported  one of the company s major us distributors has continued to experience declining net sales and a significant net loss for the period most recently reported 
in october  this distributor announced plans to begin a formal review of its strategic alternatives  including a major refinancing effort 
the company has accounts receivable due from this distributor in the amount of million as of august  based on information presently available to the company and the payment history of this distributor  the company continues to believe the receivables due from this distributor will be collected in the normal course of business 
however  in the event some or all of these receivables become uncollectible  the company s future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company intends to continue to monitor this situation closely to mitigate its future credit risk exposure 
inventories increased million in fiscal from million at august   due primarily to slower than expected sales of the company s hemosonic products and to higher per unit manufacturing costs at the company s domestic manufacturing facilities in the second half of the year 
prepaid expenses increased million in fiscal from million at august   due primarily to increases in prepaid pension costs and anticipated tax refunds 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in the company s investing activities decreased to million in the year ended august  from million in fiscal due primarily to the use of less cash for business acquisitions 
at august   the company had revolving credit facilities providing a total of million in available revolving credit for general business purposes  of which million was outstanding 
in april  the terms of these facilities were amended and restated to  among other things  include certain of the company s subsidiaries as permitted borrowers  allowing up to million of the million to be drawn upon by any one or more of these subsidiaries in their local currency 
in august  the company refinanced the current portion of its long term intercompany foreign denominated indebtedness of million through advances under these revolving credit facilities 
the company has million of both available and outstanding credit facilities related to this foreign debt refinancing at august  under these credit facilities  the company is required to comply with the following financial convenants maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth total assets less total liabilities and intangible assets of no more than to and a cash flow coverage ratio of to or greater  a limitation on certain mergers  consolidations  and sales of assets by the company or its subsidiaries  a limitation on its and its subsidiaries incurrence of liens  and a limitation requirement that the lender approves the incurrence of indebtedness unrelated to the revolving credit facility when the amounts are in an amount in excess of million in the aggregate 
at august   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
in addition  certain other subsidiaries of the company had revolving credit facilities totaling the us dollar equivalent of million  of which million was outstanding as of august  interest rate terms for both us and foreign bank credit facilities are based on either bids provided by the lender or the prime rate  london interbank offered rates libor or certificate of deposit rates  plus applicable margins 
certain of these borrowings  primarily those with us banks  are due on demand 
interest is payable monthly during the revolving credit period 
at august   the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings was 
combined borrowings under these facilities decreased million during fiscal financing activities used million of net cash in fiscal  due primarily to the repayment of the company s current portion of long term foreign denominated indebtedness and dividend payments 
financing activities used million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased use of cash to purchase shares of the company s common stock in the open market in connection with its previously announced share repurchase program offset by increased borrowing related to the company s acquisition of sometec  sa in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock under this program for million 
as of november   the company had repurchased a total of  shares under this program for approximately million since the program s inception in march liquidity and capital resources continued during fiscal  and  the percentage of the company s sales invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar was  and  respectively 
in addition  a small part of the company s cost of goods sold is denominated in foreign currencies 
the company enters into foreign currency exchange and foreign currency option contracts  which are derivative financial instruments  with major financial institutions to reduce the effect of these foreign currency risks  primarily on us dollar cash inflows resulting from the collection of intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge anticipated sales in foreign currencies to foreign subsidiaries 
such transactions occur throughout the year and are probable  but not firmly committed 
forward contracts are marked to market each accounting period  and the resulting gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense of the company s consolidated statements of income 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the us dollar value of the foreign denominated assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
the premiums paid on the foreign currency option contracts are recorded as assets and amortized over the life of the option 
the company s maximum exposure related to foreign currency options is limited to the premiums paid 
the total premiums authorized to be paid in any fiscal year cannot exceed million per the terms of the foreign currency management policy statement approved by the company s board of directors in january gains and losses on purchased option contracts result from changes in intrinsic or time value 
time value gains and losses are recognized immediately against net sales 
intrinsic value gains and losses are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income until the period in which the underlying sale by the foreign subsidiary to an unrelated third party is recognized  at which point those deferred gains and losses are recognized in net sales 
by their nature  all such contracts involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
accordingly  losses relating to these contracts could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based upon the company s knowledge of the financial condition of the counterparties to its existing forward contracts  the company believes that it does not have any material exposure to any individual counterparty 
the company s policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
as of november   outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts totaling the us dollar equivalent of million mature at various dates through december and foreign currency option contracts with a fair market value of million mature at various dates through may the company expects to continue to utilize foreign currency exchange and foreign currency option contracts to manage its exposure  although there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in this regard will be successful 
the company s exposure to credit risk consists principally of trade receivables 
hospitals and international dealers account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required 
other than as described above with respect to one of the company s major us distributors  the company believes that its risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the company s on going credit review procedures 
as part of the company s purchase of assets of the cardiac assist division of cr bard  inc  the company also agreed to acquire specified assets and assume specified liabilities of the belmont instruments corporation for million based on the achievement of certain milestones 
the company paid million in fiscal for achievement of milestones during that period 
during fiscal  the company paid million to belmont for achievement of additional milestones 
included in the fiscal payments was the first two of eight quarterly installments of million payable by the company which commenced in april  leaving million remaining to be paid as of august  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately million is being amortized over a period of years 
the results of operations of this business are included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources continued in october  the company s board of directors approved spending of up to million for the construction of additional manufacturing capacity at its existing manufacturing and research facility in the czech republic 
the approved spending includes amounts required for construction of the additional space as well as all equipment required to meet production needs at such space 
this new construction commenced during fiscal and is proceeding as planned  with an anticipated completion date in december as of august   the company had spent million on this construction 
based upon its present plans  the company believes that its working capital  operating cash flow and available credit sources will be adequate to repay current portions of long term debt  to finance currently planned capital expenditures and to meet the currently foreseeable liquidity needs of the company 
during the periods discussed above  the overall effects of inflation and seasonality on the company s business were not significant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk due to the global nature of its operations  the company is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
such exposures arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  primarily from translation of results of operations from outside the united states  intercompany loans  and intercompany purchases of inventory 
the company is also exposed to interest rate changes 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated foreign currency revenues to meet these objectives 
the contracts involve japanese yen and other foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts are offset by changes in the value of the related exposures in the company s income statement 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent true exposures exist 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
the fair value of all the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at august  was less than million  which does not represent the company s actual exposure
