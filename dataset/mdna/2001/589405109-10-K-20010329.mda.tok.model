our business may have changed since the date hereof  and we undertake no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
overview we were incorporated in  and began shipping automated software testing products in since  we have introduced a number of new products  and new versions of existing products  including products and versions designed for web applications 
we believe that a majority of customers that licensed our products in are using these products to test and monitor their web applications 
we also offer hosted load testing and monitoring services for web applications 
results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
year ended december  revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development  net marketing and selling general and administrative merger related expenses total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenue license revenue increased to million in from million in and million in our growth in license revenue is attributable primarily to growth in license fees from our loadrunner  winrunner and testdirector products  as well as revenue from our new application performance management and msp offerings 
service revenue increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in service revenue in compared to and is a result of new maintenance contracts accompanying the growth in license revenue as well as renewals of existing maintenance contracts 
we expect that service revenue will continue to increase in absolute dollars as long as our customer base continues to grow 
cost of revenue license cost of revenue includes costs of materials  product packaging  equipment depreciation  production personnel  and costs associated with our msp 
license cost of revenue as a percentage of license revenue increased to in from in and in the increase was primarily due to the investment in the headcount  capital equipment and internet service fees for our msp 
service cost of revenue consists primarily of costs of providing customer technical support  training and consulting 
service cost of revenue increased to million in from million in and million in as a percentage of service revenue  it decreased to in from in and in the absolute dollar increase in service cost of revenue in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in customer support and consulting headcount from at december  to at december  and a million increase in training and consulting outsourcing expense 
research and development  net research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products  and quality assurance procedures  and comprised primarily of employee salaries and related costs  consulting costs  equipment depreciation and facilities expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development  net was million  or of total revenue  an increase from million  or of total revenue in  and million  or of total revenue in the increase in absolute dollars of research and development spending in as compared to reflected primarily increased research and development headcount from at december  to at december  and increased salaries of research and development engineers 
research and development expense is reported net of research grants received from the government of israel  and includes royalty expense for obligations to the government of israel for sales of products developed under government funded research 
no grants were obtained from the office of the chief scientist in the israeli ministry of industry and trade during and research grants received amounted to million in we were not obligated to repay these grants  however  we agreed to pay royalties at rates ranging from to of product sales resulting from the research  up to the amount of the grants obtained and for certain grants up to of the grants obtained 
there was no royalty expense under these agreements for the year ended december  royalty expense amounted to approximately million for each of the years ended december  and as of december   we had no outstanding royalty obligations 
we have not applied for  nor do we anticipate applying for  any future grants from the office of the chief scientist 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expense consists primarily of employee salaries and related costs  commissions  facilities expenses and marketing programs 
marketing and selling expenses were million  or of total revenue  in  compared to million in and million in  both of total revenue 
the increase in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of million reflecting growth in headcount from at december  to at december   including the increase in sales head count related to our cybersales organization and apm business 
the increase in expenses in as compared to was also due to an increase in sales commissions of million attributable to higher revenue  an increase in facilities and related costs of million and an increase in spending on marketing programs of million 
we expect marketing and selling expenses to increase in absolute dollars as total revenue increases  but these expenses may vary as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee salaries and related costs related to executive and finance personnel 
general and administrative expense increased to million  or of total revenue in  from million  or of total revenue in and million  or of total revenue in the increase in the absolute dollars is primarily due to increased staffing and associated costs necessary to manage and support our growing operations 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses 
the increase in other income  net to million in from million in primarily reflected increased interest income from the proceeds of the issuance in july  of convertible subordinated notes  net of interest expense on the notes 
provision for income taxes we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investments 
the tax holidays and rate reductions  which we will be able to realize under programs currently in effect  expire at various dates through future provisions for taxes will depend upon the mix of worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and risk factors we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
merger related expenses in connection with the acquisition of conduct ltd 
in  we incurred merger related expenses of approximately million  primarily relating to legal and accounting expenses  severance and the write off of redundant facilities and equipment 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and investments compared to million at december  and million at december  the december  balance included million of short term and million of long term investments in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities 
in july  we raised million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes mature on july  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our future senior debt 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem our notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july  accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid in each redemption 
during  we generated million cash from operating activities  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due primarily to an increase in net income and increases in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
our primary investing activities were net purchases of investments of million in and million in compared to net proceeds from investments of million in we also purchased property and equipment  which totaled million in  million in and million in purchases of property and equipment in included million for the purchase of two additional headquarters buildings in sunnyvale  california  as well as million for the renovation of existing headquarters buildings 
in addition  we spent million in and million in for the purchase and renovation of headquarters buildings in sunnyvale  california 
we expect to spend an additional million to complete the renovation of our newly purchased buildings in sunnyvale 
we spent million in  million in  and million in  for the purchase and construction of research and development facilities in israel 
we expect to spend approximately million to complete the construction in israel 
our primary financing activity consisted of issuance of the convertible subordinated notes and issuances of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
proceeds from issuance of stock under these plans  net of notes receivable issued and collected from issuance of stock  amounted to million in  million in and million in assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we also expect to satisfy our financing requirements through the incurrence of debt from time to time as we did in july new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

fin was effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occurred after either december   or january  the company s adoption of the provisions of fin has not had a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to rapid market and technological changes by introducing new products and services and continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our existing products and services and responding to competitive offerings 
our business will suffer if we do not successfully respond to rapid technological changes 
the market for our software products is characterized by 
rapidly changing technology  
frequent introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services by our competitors  
increasing complexity and interdependence of web related applications  
changes in industry standards and practices  and 
changes in customer requirements and demands 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance our existing software testing and application performance management products and services and to develop new products and services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers 
the development of new products and services  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
if we fail to anticipate new technology developments  customer requirements or industry standards  or if we are unable to develop new products and services that adequately address these new developments  requirements and standards in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete  our ability to compete may be impaired and our revenues could decline 
we expect our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate  and it is difficult to predict our future revenues and operating results 
our revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including 
fluctuations in demand for and sales of our products and services  
our success in developing and introducing new products and services and the timing of new product and service introductions  
our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products and services in a timely manner  
the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors and changes in the pricing policies of these competitors  
the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and web related purchases  
changes in economic conditions affecting our customers or our industry  
the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business  
deferrals by our customers of orders in anticipation of new products or services or product enhancements  and 
the mix of our domestic and international sales  together with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of our license revenues is difficult to predict because our sales cycles are typically short and can vary substantially from product to product and customer to customer 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if total revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
we have experienced seasonality in our revenues and earnings  with the fourth quarter of the year typically having the highest revenue and earnings for the year and higher revenue and earnings than the first quarter of the following year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from the budgeting cycles of our customers and from the structure of our sales commission program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
in addition  our customers decisions to purchase our products and services are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
a slowdown in the economy may cause customers to reassess their immediate technology needs and to defer purchasing decisions  and accordingly could reduce demand for our products and services 
due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
if our operating results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the trading prices of our securities could decline 
we expect to face increasing competition in the future  which could cause reduced sales levels and result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
the market for our testing and application performance management products and services is extremely competitive  dynamic and subject to frequent technological changes 
there are few substantial barriers of entry in our market 
in addition  the use of the internet for a growing range of web applications is a recent and emerging phenomenon 
the internet lowers the barriers of entry  allowing other companies to compete with us in the testing and application performance management markets 
as a result of the increased competition  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to identify and respond to the needs of potential customers  and to new technological and market opportunities  before our competitors identify and respond to these needs and opportunities 
we may fail to respond quickly enough to these needs and opportunities 
in the market for solutions for testing of applications  our principal competitors include compuware  empirix  radview  rational software and segue software 
in the new and rapidly changing market for application performance management solutions  our competitors include providers of hosted services such as bmc software  keynote systems and service metrics a division of exodus communications  and emerging companies such as freshwater software 
in addition  we face potential competition in this market from existing providers of testing solutions such as segue 
finally  in both the market for testing solutions and the market for application performance management solutions  we face potential competition from established providers of systems and network management software such as computer associates 
the software industry is increasingly experiencing consolidation  and this could increase the resources available to our competitors and the scope of their product offerings 
our competitors and potential competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies or make more attractive offers to distribution partners and to employees 
if we fail to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future  our revenues will decline 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our products through distribution channels such as systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs 
we expect that sales of our products through these channels will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have also entered into private labelling arrangements with asps and an enterprise software company who incorporate our products and services into theirs 
we may not experience increased revenues from these new channels  which could harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs  or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products and services could result in reductions in our revenue in future periods 
in addition  our ability to increase our revenue in the future depends on our ability to expand our indirect distribution channels 
our dependence on indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including 
each of our systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  
our existing systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs may not be able to effectively sell any new products and services that we may introduce  
we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs if we lose any of our existing ones  
our systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs may also offer competitive products and services from third parties  
we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  and 
our systems integrators  value added resellers  asps  isps or isvs may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products 
in march  we entered into an agreement with tivoli systems  a subsidiary of ibm  for the joint development and marketing of a family of products for enterprise application performance management  incorporating elements of our technology  which would be marketed and sold only by tivoli 
under this agreement  we agreed that as long as tivoli continued to pay minimum royalties  we would not license this technology to any other party for purposes of developing a product similar to any developed under this agreement 
in addition  we agreed that we would not enter into technology relationships to create similar products with specified competitors of tivoli as long as tivoli continued to agree to pay minimum royalties 
in october  tivoli elected not to continue paying their required minimum royalties and the exclusive provisions of this agreement terminated 
tivoli continues to have the rights to market and sell these elements of our technology on a non exclusive basis 
we depend on strategic relationships and business alliances for continued growth of our business 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely increasingly on our ability to form strategic relationships with software and other technology companies 
these business relationships often consist of cooperative marketing programs  joint customer seminars  lead referrals and cooperation in product development 
many of these relationships are not contractual and depend on the continued voluntary cooperation of each party with us 
divergence in strategy or change in focus by  or competitive product offerings by  any of these companies may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
further  if these companies enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired  they could reduce their support of our products 
our existing relationships may be jeopardized if we enter into alliances with competitors of our strategic partners 
in addition  one or more of these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
since  we have experienced significant annual increases in revenue  employees and number of product and service offerings 
this growth has placed and  if it continues  will place a significant strain on our management and our financial  operational  marketing and sales systems 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our business  competitive position  operating results and financial condition could suffer 
although we are implementing a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our sales and customer support systems  the implementation of these systems  procedures and controls may not be completed successfully  or may disrupt our operations 
any failure by us to properly manage these transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and experience delays in the execution of our business plan 
the success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior key personnel 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could hurt our business 
if we cannot hire qualified personnel  our ability to manage our business  develop new products and increase our revenues will suffer 
we believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel at all levels in our organization is essential to the successful management of our growth 
in particular  our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on our success in expanding our direct sales force and in maintaining a high level of technical consulting  training and customer support 
there is substantial competition for experienced personnel in the software and technology industry 
if we are unable to retain our existing key personnel or attract and retain additional qualified individuals  we may from time to time experience inadequate levels of staffing to perform services for our customers 
as a result  our growth could be limited due to our lack of capacity to develop and market our products to our customers 
we depend on our international operations for a substantial portion of our revenues 
sales to customers located outside the united states have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue and we anticipate that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue 
as a percentage of our total revenues  sales to customers outside the united states were approximately in  in and in in addition  we have substantial research and development operations in israel 
we face risks associated with our international operations  including 
changes in taxes and regulatory requirements  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
the need to localize products for sale in international markets  
longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  
seasonal reductions in business activity in other parts of the world in which we operate  
political and economic instability  and 
economic downturns in international markets 
any of these risks could harm our international operations and cause lower international sales 
for example  some european countries already have laws and regulations related to technologies used on the internet that are more strict than those currently in force in the united states 
any or all of these factors could cause our business to be harmed 
because our research and development operations are primarily located in israel  we may be affected by volatile economic  political and military conditions in that country and by restrictions imposed by that country on the transfer of technology 
our operations depend on the availability of highly skilled scientific and technical personnel in israel 
our business also depends on trading relationships between israel and other countries 
in addition to the risks associated with international sales and operations generally  our operations could be adversely affected if major hostilities involving israel should occur or if trade between israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed 
these risks are compounded due to the restrictions on our ability to manufacture or transfer outside of israel any technology developed under research and development grants from the government of israel  without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
if we are unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  we may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
we have  in the past  obtained royalty bearing grants from various israeli government agencies 
in addition  we participate in special israeli government programs that provide significant tax advantages 
the loss of  or any material decrease in these tax benefits  could negatively affect our financial results 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
we have structured our operations in a manner designed to maximize income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration or tax rates applicable to us are increased 
tax authorities could challenge the manner in which profits are allocated among us and our subsidiaries  and we may not prevail in any such challenge 
if the profits recognized by our subsidiaries in jurisdictions where taxes are lower became subject to income taxes in other jurisdictions  our worldwide effective tax rate would increase 
our financial results may be negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
our foreign operations are generally transacted through our international sales subsidiaries 
as a result  these sales and related expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  our results of operations may be harmed by fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies  including 
a decrease in the value of pacific rim or european currencies relative to the us dollar  which would decrease our reported us dollar revenue  as we generate revenues in these local currencies and report the related revenues in us dollars  and 
an increase in the value of pacific rim  european or israeli currencies relative to the us dollar  which would increase our sales and marketing costs in these countries and would increase research and development costs in israel 
we attempt to limit foreign exchange exposure through operational strategies and by using forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade balances 
this requires us to estimate the volume of transactions in various currencies 
we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience material currency gains or losses 
our ability to successfully implement our business strategy depends on the continued growth of the internet 
in order for our business to be successful  the internet must continue to grow as a medium for conducting business 
however  as the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and the complexity of web based applications  the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it or the performance or reliability of the internet might be adversely affected 
security and privacy concerns may also slow the growth of the internet 
because our revenues ultimately depend upon the internet generally  our business may suffer as a result of limited or reduced growth 
acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert the attention of our management 
we may acquire or make investments in other companies with similar products and technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions or investments  we could 
issue stock that would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders  
incur debt  
assume liabilities  
incur expenses for the impairment of the value of investments or acquired assets  
incur amortization expense related to intangible assets  or 
incur large write offs 
if we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions  our operating results will suffer 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous other risks  including 
difficulties integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with ours  
failure to achieve targeted synergies  
unanticipated costs and liabilities  
diversion of management s attention from our core business  
adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired organization  
difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors and possible lawsuits 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the week period ended march   the closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include 
actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  
announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  
announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  
changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  
changes in general economic conditions  
conditions or trends affecting the software industry and the internet  and 
changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of software or internet software companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced revenues and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent that we increase our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will increase 
in many cases  we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation like this  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversions of our management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
third parties could assert that our products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to litigation that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against these claims 
parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our products in the united states and abroad and could result in an award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or to alter our products or processes or cease activities that infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
if we are required to obtain licenses  we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain required licenses could delay shipment of our products and increase our costs 
in addition  any such lawsuit could result in our incurring significant costs or the diversion of the attention of our management 
defects in our products may subject us to product liability claims and make it more difficult for us to achieve market acceptance for these products  which could harm our operating results 
our products may contain errors or bugs that may be detected at any point in the life of the product 
any future product defects discovered after shipment of our products could result in loss of revenues and a delay in the market acceptance of these products that could adversely impact our future operating results 
in selling our products  we frequently rely on shrink wrap or click wrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
under the laws of various jurisdictions  the provisions in these licenses limiting our exposure to potential product liability claims may be unenforceable 
we currently carry errors and omissions insurance against such claims  however  we cannot assure you that this insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that this insurance will provide us with adequate protection against product liability and other claims 
in the event of a product liability claim  we may be found liable and required to pay damages which would seriously harm our business 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  including an acquisition that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
furthermore  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in july  we completed an offering of convertible subordinated notes with a principal amount of million 
we now have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  primarily the convertible subordinated notes 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including 
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  and 
limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest is limited to our investment portfolio 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment policy 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or issue 
in addition  we have classified all of our investments as held to maturity 
this classification does not expose the consolidated statement of income or balance sheet to fluctuation in interest rates 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands fair thereafter total value cash equivalents fixed rate    average rate variable rate    average rate investments fixed rate     average rate total investments     average rate our long term investments include million of government agency instruments which have callable provisions and accordingly may be redeemed by the agencies should interest rates fall below the coupon rate of the investments 
the fair value of the our convertible subordinated debentures fluctuates based upon changes in the price of our common stock  changes in interest rates and changes in our creditworthiness 
the fair market value of the convertible subordinated debentures as of december  was million 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
our operating expenses in each of these countries are in the local currencies  which mitigates a significant portion of the exposure related to local currency revenues 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated receivables due from certain european and pacific rim subsidiaries against fluctuations in exchange rates
