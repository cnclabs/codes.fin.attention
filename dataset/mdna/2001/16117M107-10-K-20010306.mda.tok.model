in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of charter communications  inc as of and for the years ended december  and and for the period from december  through december  and the audited consolidated financial statements of charter communications properties holdings  llc ccph for the period from january  through december  introduction we do not believe that our historical financial condition and results of operations are accurate indicators of future results because of certain significant past events 
those events include numerous mergers  acquisitions  and debt financing transactions over the last few years and our initial public stock offering in november organizational history our organizational structure is very complex and is described in more detail in the forepart of this form k 
prior to the acquisition of the charter companies by mr 
allen on december  and the merger of marcus holdings with and into charter holdings effective april   the cable systems of the charter and marcus companies were operated under four groups of companies 
three of these groups were comprised of companies that were managed by charter investment and in which charter investment had an ownership interest 
the fourth group was comprised of companies that were subsidiaries of marcus holdings which charter investment began managing in october the charter companies prior to the acquisition by mr 
allen  the charter companies were as follows ccph ccph was a wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment 
the primary subsidiary of ccph  which owned the cable systems  was charter communications properties  llc 
on may   ccph acquired certain cable systems from sonic communications  inc for a total purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million  including million of assumed debt 
in connection with mr 
allen s acquisition on december   ccph was merged out of existence  and charter communications properties became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment 
cca group the controlling interests in cca group were held by affiliates of kelso co  and charter investment had only a minority interest 
effective december   prior to mr 
allen s acquisition  charter investment acquired from the kelso affiliates the interests the kelso affiliates held in cca group 
later  the operating companies comprising cca group became wholly owned subsidiaries of charter investment 
chartercomm holdings  llc the controlling interests in chartercomm holdings were held by affiliates of charterhouse group international inc  and charter investment had only a minority interest 
effective december   prior to mr 
allen s acquisition  charter investment acquired from the charterhouse group affiliates the interests the charterhouse group affiliates held in chartercomm holdings 
consequently  chartercomm holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment 
the cable systems were owned by the various subsidiaries of chartercomm holdings 
in connection with mr 
allen s acquisition of us on december   some of the non operating subsidiaries  including chartercomm holdings were merged out of existence 
the acquisition by mr 
allen became effective on december   through a series of transactions in which mr 
allen acquired approximately of the equity interests of charter investment for an aggregate purchase price of billion  excluding billion in assumed debt 
ccph and the operating companies that formerly comprised cca group and chartercomm holdings were contributed to charter operating subsequent to mr 
allen s acquisition 
ccph is deemed to be our predecessor 
consequently  the contribution of ccph was accounted for as a reorganization under common control 
accordingly  our results of operations for periods prior to and including december  include the accounts of ccph 
the contributions of the operating companies that formerly comprised cca group and chartercomm holdings were accounted for in accordance with purchase accounting 
accordingly  our results of operations for periods after december  include the accounts of ccph  cca group and chartercomm holdings 
in february  charter holdings was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment  and charter operating was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of charter holdings 
all of charter investment s direct interests in the entities described above were transferred to charter operating 
all of the prior management agreements were terminated  and a single new management agreement was entered into between charter investment and charter operating to cover all of the subsidiaries 
in may  charter communications holding company was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment 
all of charter investment s interests in charter holdings were transferred to charter communications holding company 
in july  charter communications  inc was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of charter investment 
in november  charter communications  inc conducted its initial public offering 
in the initial public offering  substantially all of the equity interests in charter communications  inc were sold to the public  and less than of its equity interests were sold to mr 
allen 
charter communications  inc contributed substantially all of the proceeds of its initial public offering to charter communications holding company  which issued membership units to charter communications  inc in november  the management agreement between charter investment and charter operating was amended and assigned from charter investment to charter communications  inc also in november  charter communications holding company sold membership units to vulcan cable iii 
the marcus companies in april  mr 
allen acquired approximately of the non voting economic interests in marcus cable  and agreed to acquire the remaining interests 
the owner of the remaining partnership interests retained voting control of marcus cable 
in october  marcus cable entered into a management consulting agreement with charter investment  pursuant to which charter investment provided management and consulting services to marcus cable and its subsidiaries which own cable systems 
this agreement placed the marcus cable systems under common management with the cable systems of the charter companies acquired by mr 
allen in december in march  all of mr 
allen s interests in marcus cable were transferred to marcus holdings  a then newly formed company 
later in march  mr 
allen acquired the remaining interests in marcus cable  including voting control  which interests were transferred to marcus holdings 
in april  mr 
allen merged marcus holdings into charter holdings  and the operating subsidiaries of marcus holdings and all of the cable systems they owned came under the ownership of charter holdings and  in turn  charter operating 
for financial reporting purposes  the merger of marcus holdings with and into charter holdings was accounted for as an acquisition of marcus holdings effective march   and accordingly  the results of operations of marcus holdings have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date

liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant cash to fund acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt service costs and ongoing operations

our cash flows from operating activities were billion  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december   we have availability of million under our bank credit facilities 
since january   we have incurred significant additional debt to fund our capital expenditures and growth through acquisition 
our significant amount of debt may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business 
we anticipate incurring substantial additional debt in the future 
our credit facilities and other debt instruments contain various financial and operating covenants that could adversely impact our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to distribute cash to their parents 
see certain trends and uncertainties restrictive covenants for further information 
capital expenditures we have substantial ongoing capital expenditure requirements 
we make capital expenditures primarily to upgrade  rebuild and expand our cable systems  as well as for system maintenance  the development of new products and services  and set top terminals 
upgrading our cable systems will enable us to offer new products and services  including digital television  additional channels and tiers  expanded pay per view options  high speed internet access  video on demand  telephony and interactive services 
we made capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions of cable systems  of billion and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

in  our capital expenditures will include extensions of systems  development of new products and services  purchases of converters  system improvements and the build out of six new advanced customer call centers in the amount that we spend on these types of capital expenditures will depend on the level of our growth in digital cable customers and in the delivery of other advanced services 
we currently expect to finance the anticipated capital expenditures with cash generated from operations  additional borrowings under credit facilities  one or more debt or equity financings and borrowings under the senior bridge loan commitment described in financing activities 
currently  our planned capital expenditures are funded through second quarter a projected million to million funding shortfall exists through late or early when we expect to become cash flow positive 
if we borrow the full amount available under the bridge loan commitment  our planned capital expenditures are funded through the end of and our funding shortfall will be million to million through we expect to fund our projected shortfall with additional bank debt  high yield debt  or equity offerings or any combination thereof 
the amount of this projected shortfall could increase if there is accelerated growth in digital cable customers or in the delivery of other advanced services 
we cannot be sure that our anticipated levels of capital expenditures will be sufficient to accomplish our planned system upgrades  expansion and maintenance and to roll out advanced services or that we will be able to acquire necessary plant and equipment from vendors to complete our upgrade and rebuild on schedule 
if we are not able to obtain financing sufficient to fund our planned upgrades and other capital expenditures  it could adversely affect our ability to offer new products and services and compete effectively  and could adversely affect our growth  financial condition and results of operations

on february   charter holdings and charter capital signed a commitment with morgan stanley senior funding  inc and goldman sachs credit partners lp  to provide senior increasing rate bridge loans of up to billion for capital expenditures  general corporate purposes  and to fund the cash portion of the pending at t transactions 
if any of the pending at t transactions is not completed  the commitment would be reduced by the amount of the commitment allocated to such portion of the transaction  up to billion 
the bridge loans would bear interest initially at a rate equal to the bid side yield of the senior notes  less basis points 
the rate would increase by basis points at the end of the first days after funding  and basis points for each day period after the first days 
the commitment expires on december  unless the bridge loan agreement has been signed 
the bridge loans would mature one year from the date of first funding  but can  at the borrowers election  be converted into senior term loans that would be due nine years after such conversion 
interest on the senior term loans would initially be the rate then in effect for the bridge loans  plus basis points  and would increase by basis points after every days period after such conversion 
following any conversion of the bridge loans into senior term loans  the lenders would have the right to request that their notes be exchanged for notes that would be issued under an indenture with covenants and events of default similar to those in the senior notes  but may not be redeemed until the fifth anniversary of the first funding of the bridge loan 
after the fifth anniversary  the notes would be redeemable at a premium of one half of the coupon on the note  declining ratably annually to zero on the date that is two years prior to the maturity date 
the bridge loan agreement would require that the borrowers file a shelf registration statement with respect to the exchange notes and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have the statement become effective and available to allow for unrestricted resales of the exchange notes 
the exchange notes would bear interest at the higher of the rate of interest applicable to the senior term loans and the bid side yield of the senior notes 
interest on the bridge loans  senior term loans or exchange notes would not be lower than and may not exceed annually 
the prospective lenders commitments to us are subject to a number of conditions 
we cannot assure you that such conditions will be met 
if these conditions are not met  these funds will not be available to us and we will need to obtain alternative financing 
if we are unable to obtain replacement financing  we could be unable to consummate the pending at t transactions 
for a description of our acquisitions completed in and  see business acquisitions 
outlook we believe we are uniquely positioned in the forefront of our industry going into in  we will continue to aggressively roll out our advanced services  focusing on digital cable and high speed data 
we expect to complete the at t transactions in the second and or third quarters of the effect of these transactions is not included in this outlook discussion 
with same store systems running smoothly and major and acquisitions successfully integrated  we expect revenue growth of and operating cash flow growth after corporate overhead expense of 
basic customer growth is expected to exceed in  consistent with growth 
digital revenues are expected to increase dramatically from million customers at december  with million customers by the end of in addition  we expect vod to be available to approximately million homes passed by the end of the year 
telephony initiatives will continue to be tested and developed during with targeted market entry in or furthermore  we will continue our focus on interactive tv  with trials currently in process and expected launches in several markets beginning in our advanced technology team is working on dvr capability in advanced digital set top terminals and wireless home networking 
set top terminals with built in dvr functionality should be available to our digital customers in operating expenses are expected to increase in  driven primarily by increased digital and data sales  as well as higher programming and g a costs 
programming costs are expected to increase approximately 
the year over year increase on a per channel basis is approximately 
sports programming is the largest portion of the expected increase 
the remainder of the increase is due to digital and basic customer growth  new channel launches and higher premium rates 
the primary drivers for increased g a costs are higher property taxes of approximately million  resulting from the network upgrades and approximately million of expenses associated with new customer call centers 
we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and swaps of cable systems in order to enlarge the coverage of our current areas of operations 
this approach will allow us to generate higher growth in revenues and operating cash flow 
customer care will remain a priority at charter 
we plan to build six new customer contact centers in with capital expenditures of million in these new centers will serve our customer base with state of the art technology to further improve customer satisfaction 
eventually  each of our twelve regions will have its own customer contact center 
we will continue our system rebuilds and upgrades so that our customers have access to the latest advanced service technology 
we will aggressively evaluate funding opportunities  including bank  equity or high yield financing  to meet the needs of our future growth plans  including future strategic acquisitions 
certain trends and uncertainties the following discussion highlights a number of trends and uncertainties  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this form k  that could materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
substantial leverage 
as of december   pro forma for the offering of the january charter holdings notes and the application of the net proceeds therefrom  our total debt was approximately billion 
we anticipate incurring significant additional debt in the future  including the senior bridge loan commitment  to fund future acquisitions and the expansion  maintenance and upgrade of our cable systems 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures for upgrading our cable systems and our ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate cash and secure financing in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our existing credit facilities  new facilities or from other sources of financing at acceptable rates or in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our debt  to grow our business or to fund our other liquidity and capital needs 
variable interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to short term interest rates 
in addition  a significant portion of our existing debt  assumed debt or debt we might arrange in the future will bear interest at variable rates 
if interest rates rise  our costs relative to those obligations will also rise 
at december   our weighted average rate on outstanding bank commitments is approximately and approximately on high yield debt  resulting in a blended weighted average rate of 
see interest rate risk 
restrictive covenants 
our credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding debt contain a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions  make certain investments or acquisitions  dispose of assets or merge  incur additional debt  issue equity  repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt  create liens  and pledge assets 
furthermore  in accordance with our credit facilities we are required to maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests 
the ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants will result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument  which could trigger acceleration of the debt 
any default under our credit facilities or the indentures governing our outstanding debt may adversely affect our growth  our financial condition  and our results of operations and the ability to repay amounts due under the notes issued by charter communications  inc or its subsidiaries 
new services and products growth strategy 
we expect that a substantial portion of any of our future growth will be achieved through revenues from additional services 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to offer new advanced services successfully to our customers or that those new advanced services will generate revenues 
the amount of our capital expenditures and related roll out of advanced services may be limited by the availability of certain equipment in particular  digital set top terminals and cable modems due to production capacity constraints of certain vendors and or materials shortages 
we continue to work with our primary vendors to address such problems and have been assured that we will have an adequate supply to meet our demand 
if we are unable to grow our cash flow sufficiently  we may be unable to fulfill our obligations or obtain alternative financing 
management of growth 
we have experienced rapid growth that has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management  operations and other resources 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations acquired and to be acquired and to attract and retain qualified personnel 
no significant severance cost was incurred in conjunction with acquisitions in and the failure to retain or obtain needed personnel or to implement management  operating or financial systems necessary to successfully integrate acquired operations or otherwise manage growth when and as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
regulation and legislation 
cable systems are extensively regulated at the federal  state  and local level 
effective march   the scope of rate regulation was reduced so that it continues to impact only the lowest level of basic cable service and associated equipment 
this change affords cable operators much greater pricing flexibility  although congress could revisit this issue if confronted with substantial rate increases 
cable operators also face significant regulation of their channel capacity 
they currently can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that they would not carry voluntarily  including certain local broadcast signals  local public  educational and government access users  and unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers 
this carriage burden could increase in the future  particularly if the federal communications commission fcc were to require cable systems to carry both the analog and digital versions of local broadcast signals 
the fcc is currently conducting a proceeding in which it is considering this channel usage possibility 
there is also uncertainty whether local franchising authorities  state regulators  the fcc  or the us congress will impose obligations on cable operators to provide unaffiliated internet service providers with access to cable plant on non discriminatory terms 
if they were to do so  and the obligations were found to be lawful  it could complicate our operations in general  and our internet operations in particular  from a technical and marketing standpoint 
these access obligations could adversely impact our profitability and discourage system upgrades and the introduction of new products and services 
recently  a federal district court in virginia and a federal circuit court in california struck down as unlawful open access requirements imposed by two different franchising authorities 
the federal circuit court ruling reversed an earlier district court decision that had upheld an open access requirement 
the fcc has announced that it will soon consider how internet service provided over cable systems should be classified for regulatory purposes and what  if any  regulations should be imposed 
there are other instances where open access requirements have been imposed and judicial challenges are pending 
the fcc has initiated a new proceeding to categorize cable delivered internet service and perhaps establish an appropriate regulatory scheme 
interest rate risk the use of interest rate risk management instruments  such as interest rate exchange agreements  interest rate cap agreements and interest rate collar agreements  is required under the terms of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries 
our policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
using interest rate swap agreements  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
interest rate cap agreements are used to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates rise  but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates 
collars limit our exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates 
our participation in interest rate hedging transactions involves instruments that have a close correlation with our debt  thereby managing our risk 
interest rate hedge agreements have been designated for hedging purposes and are not held or issued for speculative purposes 
at december   we had outstanding billion  million and million in notional amounts of interest rate swaps  caps and collars  respectively 
the notional amounts of interest rate instruments are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
while swaps  caps and collars represent an integral part of our interest rate risk management program  their incremental effect on interest expense for the years ended december  and  was not significant 
the fair value of fixed rate debt at december   was billion 
the fair value of fixed rate debt is based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value of billion at december   since this debt bears interest at current market rates 
accounting standards not yet implemented sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  is effective for the company as of january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
adoption of these new accounting standards is expected to result in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that increases net loss by approximately million
