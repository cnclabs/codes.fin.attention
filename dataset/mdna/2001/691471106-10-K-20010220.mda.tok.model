as of december   the interest rate on the new term loan  utilizing the base rate borrowing option  was 
as a result of a decline in the prime rate  the base rate option applicable to borrowings under the senior credit facilities decreased to on january  on january   the new term loan was converted to a libor basis 
currently interest is being calculated based on an million tranche at a rate of through march  and an million tranche at a rate of through july  the average interest rate is approximately through march  commitment fees of per annum are payable on the unused portion of the revolver

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes a significant amount of assets whose fair value is subject to market risk 
since a substantial portion of the company s investments are in fixed income securities  interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
interest rates are managed within a tight duration band  generally averaging to years  and credit risk is managed by investing in us government obligations and in corporate debt securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio 
the company s investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and the company s cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
the company s investment in equity securities as of december  was not significant 
in order to determine the sensitivity of the company s investment portfolio to changes in market risk  valuation estimates were made on each security in the portfolio using a duration model 
duration models measure the expected change in security market prices arising from hypothetical movements in market interest rates 
convexity further adjusts the estimated price change by mathematically correcting the changes in duration as market interest rates shift 
the model used industry standard calculations of security duration and convexity as provided by third party vendors such as bloomberg and yield book 
for certain structured notes  callable corporate notes  and callable agency bonds  the duration calculation utilized an option adjusted approach  which helps to ensure that hypothetical interest rate movements are applied in a consistent way to securities that have embedded call and put features 
the model assumed that changes in interest rates were the result of parallel shifts in the yield curve 
therefore  the same basis point change was applied to all maturities in the portfolio 
the change in valuation was tested using positive and negative adjustments in yield of and basis points 
hypothetical immediate increases of and basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december  respectively 
hypothetical immediate decreases of and basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s investment in debt securities as of december  by approximately million and million  respectively compared to million and million as of december   respectively 
because duration and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities  there can be no assurance that the company s portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values
