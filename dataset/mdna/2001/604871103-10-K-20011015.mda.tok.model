income taxes 
for fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit of  or as compared to a tax provision of  or for fiscal year the current year tax benefits consisted of a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance of  during the first quarter of offset by an increase of the deferred tax valuation allowance of  in the third quarter  relating to the write down of the equity investments and related debentures and notes 
in connection with the loss on impairment of equity investments  which included the carrying value of the investments and related notes and debentures  the company recorded a deferred tax asset in the amount of  the company recorded a full valuation allowance against the asset in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
the valuation allowance was determined by estimating the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax asset  management considered where then it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
based upon the capital nature of the deferred tax asset and the company s projections for future capital gains in which the deferred tax asset would be deductible  management did not deem it more likely than not that the asset would be recoverable at june  the company had previously recorded a reduction of the valuation allowance applied against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes which provided a one time income tax benefit of  during the first quarter of fiscal year the valuation allowance was established in fiscal year because the future tax benefit of certain below market stock option grants issued at that time could not be reasonably assured 
the company continually reviews the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognized the income tax benefit during the quarter due to the reasonable expectation that such tax benefit will be realized due to the fiscal strength of the company 
management believes that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the tax benefit associated with these future deductible temporary differences and  therefore  the company reduced the valuation allowance during the first quarter of fiscal year fiscal years ended june  and net sales 
net sales increased by between the fiscal year ended june  and the fiscal year ended june  from  to  the increase for the period is due to an increase in therapeutic medical device sales including shipments of the soft tissue aspirator  the consolidated revenues of sonora  and increased revenues of wet scrubbers mystaire  partially offset by lower domestic fume enclosure and labcaire shipments

on august   labcaire renewed its overdraft facility with hsbc bank plc until august  under the new terms  the amount of this facility is  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus up to  and the bank s base rate plus for amounts over  this facility is secured by the assets of labcaire 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will enable it to maintain its current and planned operations for at least months from the date hereof 
other in the opinion of management  inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on short term investments and foreign exchange rates  which generate translation gains and losses due to the english pound to us dollar conversion of labcaire 
interest rates the company s short term investments  which approximated million at june   are made up entirely of held to maturity investments  which include mostly corporate bonds with a rating of a or higher 
assuming investment levels remained the same  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s interest income 
the company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements 
foreign exchange rates approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were received in english pounds currency 
to the extent that the company s revenues are generated in english pounds  its operating results are translated for reporting purposes into us dollars using rates of and for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
a strengthening of the english pound  in relation to the us dollar  will have the effect of increasing its reported revenues and profits  while a weakening of the english pound will have the opposite effect 
since the company s operations in england generally sets prices and bids for contracts in english pounds  a strengthening of the english pound  while increasing the value of its uk assets  might place the company at a pricing disadvantage in bidding for work from manufacturers based overseas 
the company collects its receivables in the currency the subsidiary resides in 
the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions  which include forward exchange agreements 
euro conversion the january  adoption of the euro created a single currency market in much of europe 
for a transition period from january  through january   the existing local currencies are anticipated to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro 
the company does not anticipate that its operations will be materially adversely affected by the conversion to the euro 
the company has analyzed the impact of conversion to the euro on its existing systems and operations and implemented modifications to its systems to enable the company to handle euro invoicing for the transactions  which commenced in the company anticipates that the cost of such modifications should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or liquidity
