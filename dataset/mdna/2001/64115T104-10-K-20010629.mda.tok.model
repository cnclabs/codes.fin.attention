overview netscout systems designs  develops  manufactures  markets and supports a family of integrated products that enable optimization of the performance and cost management of complex  high speed networks  including their ability to deliver critical business applications and content to end users efficiently 
we manufacture and market these products in an integrated hardware and software solution suite that is used by enterprise and service provider businesses worldwide 
netscout was incorporated in as a consulting services company 
in  the company began to develop and market its first infrastructure performance management products 
our operations have been financed principally through cash provided by operations and we have been profitable for each of the last eight years 
on july   netscout completed its acquisition of nextpoint networks  inc the transaction was valued at approximately million 
product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated product returns which is based upon our return policy and historical experience 
service revenue consists primarily of customer fees from support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide three months of software support and months of hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue from software support is deferred and recognized ratably over the three month support period 
revenue from hardware support is deferred and recognized ratably over the month support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements  typically for month periods 
revenue from these agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the work is performed 
for multi element arrangements  each element of the arrangement is analyzed and we allocate a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the element and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie generally hardware products and licensed software products  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element  under the residual method 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price the customer is required to pay when the element is sold separately 
license and royalty revenue consists primarily of royalties paid under license agreements by original equipment manufacturers who incorporate components of our data collection technology into their own products or who reproduce and sell our software products 
license revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred and when we become contractually entitled to receive license fees  provided that such fees are fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon product shipment by the license holder 
revenue from indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and service providers  represented  and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and our revenue from cisco represented  and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
no other customer or indirect channel partner accounted for or more of our total revenue during the fiscal years ended march   or cisco resold our probes to customers under its own private label in the fiscal years ended march   and as of july   cisco will no longer private label netscout probes 
however  cisco will continue to incorporate components of our software technology into its products 
our strategy is to continue to collaborate with cisco on development and marketing and to support cisco s continued distribution of our software products 
we also intend to generate programs with cisco to establish mechanisms for referrals of netscout probe business and to successfully transition the cisco customer and reseller probe relationships to netscout 
we see continued opportunity in our relationship with this computer networking industry leader and intend to continue increasing the sale  visibility and accelerated market acceptance of our products via this relationship worldwide 
revenue from sales outside north america represented  and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales outside north america are primarily to indirect channel partners  which are generally responsible for importing products and providing consulting and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside north america made by any of our north american based indirect channel partners 
the north america revenue figures include sales made by netscout to these north american based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers may sell netscout product to international locations  however  netscout still reports these shipments as north america revenue since netscout ships the product to a domestic location 
we expect revenue from sales outside north america to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future

a portion of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process research and development ipr d and completed technology 
completed technology and ipr d were identified and valued through interviews and analysis of data regarding products under development 
developmental projects that had reached technological feasibility were classified as completed technology 
projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses were classified as ipr d and charged as an expense on the day of the acquisition 
the value of ipr d was determined considering the project s stage of completion the time and resources needed for completion  the contribution of core technology  and the projected discounted cash flows of completed products 
the discount rate was determined considering weighted average cost of capital and the risk surrounding the successful completion of the projects under development 
interest income  net

our effective tax rate remained constant at for the fiscal years ended march  and net income 
net income was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing a increase from to this increase was primarily due to revenue growth offset by increases in operating expenses necessary to manage our expanding business from to liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations through cash provided by operating activities 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
we have a line of credit with a bank  which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit 
the line of credit expires in march amounts available under the line of credit are a function of eligible accounts receivable and bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
as of march   we had letters of credit outstanding under the line aggregating  the bank line of credit is secured by our inventory and accounts receivable 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived from net income and to a lesser degree an increase in depreciation and amortization 
this was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived from net income and to a lesser degree an increase in depreciation and amortization  accrued compensation and other expenses and deferred revenue 
this was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  prepaids and other current assets  and refundable income taxes and a decrease in accounts payable 
in fiscal year  cash provided by operating activities was primarily derived by net income and increases in depreciation and amortization  deferred revenue and compensation expense associated with equity awards 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventories 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was primarily due to the maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by the purchase of fixed assets 
cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   which reflects the purchase of marketable securities and  to a lesser degree  the purchase of fixed assets 
cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   which reflects cash paid for the acquisition of nextpoint  the purchase of marketable securities and the purchase of fixed assets largely offset by the proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended march   which was due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock  less the purchase of treasury stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was due to the initial public offering proceeds 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   which was due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by the repayment of notes payables assumed with the acquisition of nextpoint 
we believe that our current cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
netscout has not engaged in derivative hedging activities and  accordingly  does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial reporting and related disclosures 
netscout will adopt sfas no 
 as required by sfas no 
 in fiscal year certain factors which may affect future results our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report 
additional risks that are not yet identified or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a reduction in orders from customers of cisco systems  inc 
could materially adversely affect our business 
our operating results and financial condition for a particular fiscal period could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to sell our products directly or through channel partners to customers of cisco systems  inc as of july   cisco will no longer sell our probes to third parties under its private label  although they will continue to incorporate some of our software into their products 
in the past  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from cisco 
by selling our probes under its private label  cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
if  as a result of our new arrangement with cisco  we are unable to sell our products directly or through channel partners to customers of cisco  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
a termination of our strategic relationship with cisco may materially adversely affect our business 
our strategic relationship with cisco provides us with early insight into the development of new technologies 
additionally  cisco incorporates some of our software in their products and provides royalty revenue to netscout 
royalty revenue from software sales to cisco accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
cisco may decide to cease purchasing our software and or to internally develop products that compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or sell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
if our strategic relationship with cisco were terminated or further adversely affected for any reason  our business  operating results and financial conditions could be materially adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  and therefore this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for that quarter 
our quarterly revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including the following current technology spending by actual and potential customers  the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions is in an early stage of development and therefore demand for our solutions may be uneven  the timing and receipt of orders from customers  especially in light of our lengthy sales cycle  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  distribution channels through which our products are sold could change  the timing of hiring sales personnel and the speed at which such personnel become productive  we may not be able to anticipate or adapt effectively to developing markets and rapidly changing technologies  and our prices or the prices of our competitors products may change 
we operate with minimal backlog because our products typically are shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product revenue in any quarter is substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and revenue for any future quarter is not predictable to any degree of certainty 
therefore  any significant deferral of orders for our products would cause a shortfall in revenue for that quarter 
our continued growth depends on our ability to expand our sales force 
we must increase the size of our sales force in order to increase our direct sales and support our indirect sales channels 
because our products are very technical  sales people require a long period of time to become productive  typically three to twelve months 
this lag in productivity  as well as the challenge of attracting qualified candidates  may make it difficult to meet our sales force growth targets 
further  we may not generate sufficient sales to offset the increased expense resulting from growing our sales force 
if we are unable to successfully expand our sales capability  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to expand and manage indirect distribution channels 
to increase our sales  we must develop new and further expand and manage existing indirect distribution channels  including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  resellers  systems integrators and service providers 
sales to our indirect distribution channels accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
sales to cisco  who will no longer resell our probes as of july   accounted for  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and our indirect channel partners have no obligation to purchase any products from us 
in addition  they could internally develop products  which compete with our solutions or partner with our competitors or bundle or resell competitors solutions  possibly at lower prices 
our inability to develop new relationships and to expand and manage our existing relationships with partners  the inability or unwillingness of our partners to effectively market and sell our products or the loss of existing partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to introduce new products and enhance our existing products to keep up with rapid technological change  demand for our products may decline 
the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions is relatively new and is characterized by rapid changes in technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements 
our success is dependent upon our ability to meet our customers needs  which are driven by changes in computer networking technologies and the emergence of new industry standards 
in addition  new technologies may shorten the life cycle for our products or could render our existing or planned products obsolete 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new network and application infrastructure performance management products or enhancements to existing products in a timely and successful manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on sole source suppliers could adversely affect our business 
many components that are necessary for the assembly of our probes are obtained from separate sole source suppliers or a limited group of suppliers 
these components include some of our network interface cards  which are produced for us solely by sbs technologies  inc  syskonnect  inc 
and adaptec  inc 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or large volumes of inventory 
our inability to obtain adequate deliveries or the occurrence of any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of these components would affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis 
this could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  cause shortfalls in expected revenue and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face significant competition from other technology companies 
the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions is intensely competitive 
we believe customers make network management system purchasing decisions based primarily upon the following factors product performance  functionality and price  name and reputation of vendor  distribution strength  and alliances with industry partners 
we compete with probe vendors  such as agilent technologies  providers of network performance management solutions  such as concord communications  inc and micromuse  inc and providers of portable network traffic analyzers  such as network associates  inc new vendors of network performance monitoring and enhancing equipment are emerging to compete with us  including packeteer  inc in addition  leading network equipment providers could offer their own or competitors solutions in the future 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  management  marketing  service  support  technical  distribution and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
as a result of these and other factors  we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth in the market for and the commercial acceptance of network and application infrastructure performance management solutions 
we derive all of our revenue from the sale of products and services that are designed to allow our customers to manage the performance of computer networks and software applications 
the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions is in an early stage of development 
therefore  we cannot accurately assess the size of the market and may be unable to predict the appropriate features and prices for products to address the market  the optimal distribution strategy and the competitive environment that will develop 
in order for us to be successful  our potential customers must recognize the value of more sophisticated network and application infrastructure performance management solutions  decide to invest in the management of their networks and the performance of software applications and  in particular  adopt our management solutions 
any failure of this market to continue to develop would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
businesses may choose to outsource the management of their networks and applications to service providers 
our business may depend on our ability to develop relationships with these service providers and successfully market our products to them 
failure to properly manage growth could adversely affect our business 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth over the past several years 
the growth in size and complexity of our business and our customer base has been and will continue to be a significant challenge to our management and operations 
to manage further growth effectively  we must enhance our financial information and accounting systems and controls  integrate new personnel and manage expanded operations 
if we are unable to effectively manage our growth  our costs  the quality of our products  the effectiveness of our sales organization  and our ability to retain key personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of anil singhal  our chief executive officer  president and co founder  and narendra popat  our chairman of the board and co founder 
we also depend on the ability of our other executive officers and senior managers to work effectively as a team 
the loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must hire and retain skilled personnel in a tight labor market 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the computer software  hardware and networking industries 
the demand for qualified personnel is particularly acute in the new england area due to the large number of software and high technology companies 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers  and technical support personnel 
we have had difficulty hiring and retaining these highly skilled employees in the past 
if we are unable to attract and retain the highly skilled technical personnel that are integral to our sales  marketing  product development and customer support teams  the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements may be limited 
this inability could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our business is heavily dependent on our intellectual property 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without compensating us 
legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information  or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use by third parties and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
further  we also license software from third parties for use as part of our products  and if any of these licenses were to terminate  we may experience delays in product shipment until we develop or license alternative software 
others may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to claims by others that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights 
these claims  whether or not valid  could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products or acquire licenses to such third party intellectual property 
we may not be able to secure any required licenses on commercially reasonable terms or secure them at all 
we expect that these claims will become more frequent as more companies enter the market for network and application infrastructure performance management solutions 
any of these claims or resulting events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our products contain errors  they may be costly to correct  revenue may be delayed  we could be sued and our reputation could be harmed 
despite testing by our customers and us  errors may be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments 
if errors are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  we may need to make significant expenditures of capital resources in order to eliminate errors and failures 
errors and failures in our products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation 
if one or more of our products fail  a customer may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us 
the occurrence or discovery of these types of errors or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to expand and manage our international operations 
sales outside north america accounted for a significant percentage of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and we currently expect international revenue to continue to account for a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
we believe that we must continue to expand our international sales activities in order to be successful 
our international sales growth will be limited if we are unable to expand international indirect distribution channels  hire additional sales personnel  adapt products for local markets  and manage geographically dispersed operations 
the major countries outside of north america  in which we do  or intend to do business  are the united kingdom  germany and japan 
our international operations  including our operations in the united kingdom  germany and japan  are generally subject to a number of risks  including failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  dependence on local indirect channel partners  multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political and economic instability 
the price of our common stock may decrease due to market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and has fluctuated significantly since the initial public offering of our common stock on august  the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology companies have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
also  broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock 
if any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider all highly liquid marketable securities purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are stated at amortized cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair value 
cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments and us treasury bills 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  but do not believe that an increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the value of our marketable securities 
the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s exposure to interest rates has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that the company currently has no outstanding amounts on its million line of credit 
the company s exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that we conduct all company business in us dollars 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements on intercompany transactions was immaterial for fiscal year currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
ultimately  there will be a single currency within certain countries of the european union  known as the euro  and one organization  the european central bank  responsible for setting european monetary policy 
we have reviewed the impact the euro will have on our business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in our commercial operations or treasury management functions 
because our transactions are denominated in us dollars  we do not believe that the euro conversion or any other currency exchange will have any material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
