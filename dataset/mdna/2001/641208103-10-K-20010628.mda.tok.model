com is currently developing new products for the broadband equipment market that are intended to offset the decline in product revenue of our promina product line 
we expect the new broadband products to begin generating additional product revenue in the upcoming fiscal year 
service and other revenue sales decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal fiscal was a decrease of compared to the million in fiscal the decrease in service and other revenue is primarily the result of the following our sale of the fsb to caci in the third quarter of fiscal  which accounted for million of the decrease in fiscal the fsb service and other revenue in fiscal was million  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal a decline in the installed base of promina equipment that requires on going service support 
as part of the broadband strategy  we are developing new service creation solutions that we expect will expand our service offerings in the new fiscal year and offset part of the service and other revenue decline in fiscal although we expect incremental service and other revenue from the broadband offerings  we expect the service and other revenue to decline in the new fiscal year compared to fiscal as a result of the sale of fsb gross margin total gross margin  comprised of product and service margin  decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in total gross margin is primarily the result of the following lower product gross margin 
product gross margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in product gross margin is primarily the result of unfavorable manufacturing variances that resulted from lower product revenues 
in addition  a charge of million for inventory reserves in connection with the end of life and subsequent obsolescence of the stm and the router accelerator product lines were taken in fiscal lower product revenue as a percent of total revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal and product revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal since gross margins are higher for product revenue than for service revenue  the decline in the percentage of product revenue had an unfavorable impact on total gross margins 
service and other revenue gross margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal fiscal gross margin increased compared with fiscal gross margin of 
the decrease in service and other revenue gross margin in fiscal is primarily the result of lower service contract revenues and relatively fixed service support expenses 
the gross margin increase in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from reduced headcount for service support 
page operating expenses operating expenses in fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue is primarily a result of lower revenue 
in the second and fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed two separate restructurings that included a reduction in our workforce 
these reductions contributed to lower operating expenses in fiscal the restructure expense in fiscal was a credit of million compared to an expense of million in fiscal and an expense of million in fiscal the credit in fiscal resulted from lower costs than initially estimated related to the closure of field offices 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily from the lower revenues in fiscal compared to both prior periods 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales and marketing spending as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal spending resulted from reduced headcount  lower travel expenses  and lower sales related costs 
we expect sales and marketing expense to decline slightly in fiscal as we balance the priorities of cost control and the importance of marketing activities associated with the introduction of our new broadband products 
research and development expenses in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development spending as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in spending in fiscal compared to is primarily from reduced facility related costs 
in fiscal  we focused research and development resources on the development and release of our broadband technology offerings 
we expect personnel related costs tied to the flowwise networks  inc acquisition to decline and as a result  total research and development spending to decline slightly in the new fiscal year 
general and administrative expense in fiscal decreased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal general and administrative spending as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative spending is a result of lower headcount and reduced consulting expenses 
we expect general and administrative spending to decline slightly from continued focus on cost control 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and zero in fiscal the amortization is a result of two acquisitions  flowwise networks inc in the third quarter of fiscal and convergence equipment company in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill and other intangibles will be amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
a charge of  was recorded in fiscal for purchased in process technology that arose from the acquisition of flowwise 
non operating items interest income  primarily related to cash investments  increased  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in interest income is primarily the result of higher yields from our investment portfolio in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a shift in the investment portfolio from tax exempt securities to taxable securities 
interest expense from the convertible subordinated debentures  and the debt obligations assumed by net 
com as part of acquisition of flowwise decreased in fiscal  to million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the reduction in principal for the debt obligations 
we do not expect an increase in interest expense in fiscal other income in fiscal increased million to million  compared to million in fiscal and  in fiscal other income in fiscal included a gain of million from the sale of the federal services business 
other income in fiscal years and includes gains of million and million  respectively  primarily from the sale of all of the equity securities held in a publicly traded company 
fiscal included a tax benefit of million as compared to tax provision of million in fiscal and a tax benefit of million in fiscal in fiscal  we reevaluated the adequacy of our tax liability reserves taking into account the statute of limitations on previously filed tax returns as well as our expected fiscal year net losses 
the result of this reevaluation was to reduce the amount of necessary reserves and to record a tax benefit of million 
page liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of  and short term investments of million for a total of million as compared to million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the sale of the federal services business and insurance proceeds  both of which will be discussed below 
net cash used by operations was million in fiscal  compared to million used in the prior year 
this compares to net cash provided by operations of million in fiscal the decrease in resulted primarily from a net loss of million  an adjustment for the sale of the federal service business of million  an increase in inventory of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
partially offsetting the reductions was the adjustment for depreciation and amortization of million and the million in cash received from insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of construction defects at our fremont campus 
pursuant to our settlement agreement  we will be eligible to receive additional insurance proceeds as a function of costs incurred for moving and replacement of tenant improvements 
net cash provided from investment activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this compares to net cash used for investing activities of million in fiscal net cash provided by investment activities consisted primarily of the proceeds from maturing temporary cash investments of million  million cash received from the sale of the federal services business and a decrease in restricted cash of million mostly due to our closing our line of credit 
net cash used for investing activities was million in purchases of temporary cash investments and the net use of million cash for the purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal this compares to net cash used for financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities was million from the sale of common stock  which was partially offset by the use of million in cash for the repurchase of common stock 
the board of directors re authorized a share repurchase program in october of in fiscal   common shares at an average price of per common share were repurchased 
we intend to continue the share repurchase program in fiscal and from time to time will reenter the market to repurchase shares 
we believe that our existing current cash and cash equivalents  temporary cash investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  purchases of capital equipment and research and development programs currently planned at least through the next months 
business environment and risk factors net 
com s business is subject to the risks below 
although we have tried to identify the material risks to our business  this is not an all inclusive list 
there may be additional risks not listed because either they have not yet been identified or they are not material now  although they could become material in the future 
any one of the risks identified below could materially impact our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have incurred net losses in fiscal year and and expect to incur future losses 
for the past two fiscal years we have incurred net losses 
our ability to achieve profitability on a continuing basis will depend on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our new broadband equipment products  specifically our scream tm product line and to a lesser degree our shoutip product line 
we expect to continue to incur significant product development  sales and marketing and administrative expenses as we continue to maintain support of our existing products and customers while launching new products 
although we have taken a number of measures to reduce expenditures  most of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term making it difficult to reduce expenses rapidly 
at the current revenue levels our operating expenses are too high to enable us to be profitable 
in order to achieve profitability  we need to generate significant sales growth from our scream product line or decrease expenses  in order to offset declines in our existing promina product line 
page our operating results fluctuate significantly 
our operating results vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are the result of a number of factors including o the volume and timing of orders from and shipments to our customers  o the length and variability of the sales cycle of our products  o the timing of and our ability to obtain new customer contracts  o the timing of new products and services  o the timing and level of prototype expenses  o the availability of products and services  o the overall capital expenditures of our customers  o the market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products and services or variations in the mix of products and services we sell  o the availability and cost of key components  o the timing of revenue recognition deferrals  o the timing and size of federal budget approvals  and o general economic conditions as well as those specific to the telecommunications  internet and related industries 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
any shortfall in revenue may impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
you should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
our stock price may be volatile 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts  and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies  in particular technology companies  and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic  industry specific  and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
additionally  volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of who have been granted stock options 
the company s success depends on its ability to develop new products and product enhancements that will achieve market acceptance 
our operating results will depend to a significant extent on the successful design  development  testing  introduction  marketing  and broad commercial distribution of our new broadband equipment products  specifically our scream product line and to a lesser extent on our shoutip product line 
the success of these and other new products is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  competitive product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks 
our scream and shoutip product lines target start up telecommunications companies and long established domestic carriers such as at t  worldcom  sbc communications  and sprint 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner  or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
that in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation  and financial condition 
page we are dependent on revenue from the promina product line until we gain revenue traction on the scream product line 
currently  we derive the majority of our product revenue from our promina r product line  a circuit based technology 
we believe that the market for circuit based technology has declined and will continue to decline in the future as new networks will likely employ packet based technology 
the migration from circuit to packet based technology has happened more dramatically in the united states commercial markets than in the united states federal government market and the rest of the world 
the decline of our business in the united states commercial markets since fiscal has had a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 
should this migration extend into our international and federal government markets in a similar fashion before we gain traction on our new scream product line  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from sales to the federal government 
a significant portion of our total revenue from product sales comes from contracts with the united states federal government federal government  most of which do not include long term purchase commitments 
historically  the federal government has been slower to adopt new technology  such as packet based technology  which has had the effect of extending the product life of our older products 
if the federal government accelerated adoption of new technology by replacing the promina r product line in their networks our product revenue would decline sharply 
should we not be successful in renewing a significant number of federal government contracts  and if sales to the federal government were to decline sharply  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to successfully commercialize scream and shoutip will depend heavily on the widespread acceptance of service creation as a means of achieving maximum network productivity and on appropriate regulatory incentives 
over the last five years  carriers generated revenue by adding more customers or by offering additional services to existing customers 
offering additional services to an existing subscriber base is generally a preferred approach to generating additional revenue  but these services typically require network upgrades and the purchase of expensive equipment 
over time  however  carriers aggressive price discounts  expensive direct marketing campaigns  and massive capital outlays for infrastructure expansion have offset whatever incremental revenue increases were generated by the new services and have eroded the profitability of these companies 
since the second quarter of fiscal  we have spent the majority of our r d and marketing resources to position ourselves and our scream family of products as the next generation of telecommunications equipment that will enable carriers to maximize the delivery of new services while leveraging their existing networks and ensuring quality of service 
the future success of scream and shoutip will depend in large measure on carriers acceptance of service creation as the vehicle that will deliver revenue increases sought after by the carriers 
failure to achieve this acceptance could affect our ability to sell the scream and shoutip products and grow overall revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  without deregulation  in the united states and overseas  the economic incentive for the incumbent carrier to actively engage in changing their service delivery model to the service creation delivery model is low 
while the decision by the united states federal telecommunications commission s to decline to force incumbent local exchange carriers to unbundle their atm infrastructure  thus allowing incumbents to deny competitive carriers access to their atm networks  has made the service creation model viable for carrier revenue growth  it remains to be seen whether or not the regulatory structure in other countries will set the stage for the service creation model to take hold 
failure to achieve the regulatory structure favorable to the service creation model overseas could affect our ability to sell the scream and shoutip products overseas and to grow overall revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
page our shoutip product line may never generate significant revenue 
our shoutip product is a voice over ip product that we acquired from the purchase of the assets of convergence technologies in may while we continue to believe that the technology is good  and that there is a market for the shoutip product  it has not yet generated significant sales 
due to the competitive nature of this market segment there can be no assurances that this product will generate significant sales in the short term  if ever 
to successfully market scream  we will need to sign up significant new strategic partners who can help sell our products into the service provider market 
in order to successfully market our scream product  we will need to sign up new strategic partners  such as software application partners and product oem s or resellers 
the importance of the software application partners is that they provide critical functions  such as billing  mediation  provisioning and configuration that are needed to create a total service creation solution for our customers 
product oem or resale partners will be needed to supplement and enhance our existing direct sales force both in the united states and overseas 
while we have begun the process of identifying and signing both software application and oem or resale partners  more partners may be necessary in all these areas for us to be successful 
in particular  we may need to find strategic partners to assist us with integration of security functions  such as digital certificates  third party firewall  intrusion detection and public key management to meet evolving security needs  as well as to counter rival efforts to assert differentiation in the security area 
additionally  we may need to pursue partnerships with vendors who have optical core and core routing technologies in order to counter the end to end solution providers  such as nortel  cisco and lucent as well as to bolster the company s co marketing efforts 
failure to sign up these new strategic partners could impact on our ability to sell the scream product and grow overall revenue  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a continuation of the down turn in the national economy could materially impact our revenue and as a result  earnings and our stock price 
growth in the united states economy slowed significantly in the third quarter 
companies in many different market sectors have been impacted by the slow down 
telecommunications and other technology related markets in particular have seen growth slow significantly 
this slow growth has led to decreased revenue or earnings  which in turn has led to declines in the stock price for the technology sector as a whole 
we have seen our stock price decrease along with our competitors and others in technology 
should the united states economy continue its slow down  our revenues  earnings and ultimately our stock price could be materially affected 
the recent declines in purchases by telecommunications service providers and the overall decline of product sales in this market could impact sales over the next several quarters 
over the last twelve months  the financial health of many of the newly emerging telecommunications service providers  including many of the companies classified as competitive local exchange carriers or clecs began to deteriorate 
in addition  there is evidence that other more established service providers are cutting back on equipment purchases as part of an overall slow down in economic growth 
we believe that many telecommunications equipment companies  including net 
com  were impacted by this decline 
in addition  the timing and volume of purchases by emerging service providers can be unpredictable due to other factors  including their need to build a customer base and capacity while working within their budgetary constraints 
our ability to recognize revenue from emerging service providers will depend on the relative financial strength of the particular customer 
we may be required to write off or decrease the value of our accounts receivable from a customer whose financial condition materially deteriorates 
decreases in purchasing volume of emerging service providers or changes in the financial condition of emerging service provider customers could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 
in addition  the selling cycle of our scream product family could be extended as our service provider customers reduce their capital budgets 
page we expect gross margins to decline over future periods 
due to increases in competition  material and labor costs  subcontractor costs and changes in the mix of products we sell  we expect that our gross margins could decrease in future quarters 
some of the new products we introduced recently have lower gross margins than our promina product line 
however  we expect that new product offerings slated for introduction in the second half of fiscal will have gross margins similar to or higher than our promina product line 
in addition  if product sales continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue  overall margins may decrease because service revenue has a lower margin than product sales 
in addition  to the extent we expand our sales through product resellers and strategic partnerships  we expect to earn lower gross margins 
recently our subcontractor manufacturer increased our material costs by due to increased demand and an overall shortage of capacity in the semiconductor and other component industries 
the current economic slowdown may help alleviate some of the pricing pressure on component parts  although there is no assurance that these benefits will be passed on to us from our suppliers or contract manufacturer 
any one of these factors by themselves or all of them in combination may decrease our product margins and our overall gross margins 
factors beyond our control could affect our ability to sell into international markets as a general rule  international sales tend to have risks that are difficult to foresee and plan for including political and economic stability  regulatory changes  currency exchange rates  changes in tax rates and structures  and collection of accounts receivable 
unforeseen events in various areas of the globe may have an adverse impact on us 
further  our international markets are served primarily by non exclusive resellers who themselves may be severely impacted by economic or market changes within a particular country or region 
unforeseen or unpredictable changes in international markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot guarantee that our divestiture of our federal services business will prove successful 
on december   we closed the sale of our federal services business fsb to caci international inc caci  who will continue to provide maintenance and other services to our federal customers 
we continue to sell net 
com products directly to the federal government and  additionally  have a strategic alliance with the acquirer  caci  to jointly market each other s products and services 
for the divestiture to be successful  caci must continue to provide the level of service to which our customers have become accustomed 
should caci experience difficulties in providing those services  it could impact purchasing decisions for our product and cause federal customers to seek products from other vendors 
in addition  in order to realize the full economic benefits of the sale  net 
com must facilitate the assignment and extension of certain contracts with the federal government that trigger up to an additional million of consideration under the divestiture agreement 
if the divestiture of our fsb proves unsuccessful  it could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
increased competition is likely in the future 
the market for telecommunication equipment is a highly competitive and dynamic market characterized by the easy entrance of new start up companies  rapid changes to and the convergence of technologies and a worldwide migration from existing circuit technology to the new packet based technologies 
we compete directly both internationally and domestically with many different companies  some of which are large  established suppliers of end to end solutions such as cisco  lucent  alcatel and nortel 
in addition  there are a number of new start ups that are targeting this market  including cosine  ellacoya  quarry  gotham  celox and others 
many of the large suppliers have greater financial  marketing and technical resources and offer a wider range of networking products than we offer 
they are often able to devote greater resources to the development  marketing and sale of their products and to use their equity or significant cash reserves to acquire other companies with technology and or products that compete directly with ours 
they often can compete favorably on price because their large product selection allows them to bundle multiple solutions together without significantly impacting their overall product margins 
small start up ventures are better able than net 
com to focus their resources on a particular product development unencumbered by the requirements to support an existing product line 
through these acquisitions  page competitors can obtain strategic advantages that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the networking equipment market has seen the constant introduction of new technologies that has reduced the value of older technology solutions 
this has created pricing pressure on older products while increasing the performance expectations of newer networking equipment 
moreover  broadband technology standards are constantly evolving and alternative technologies or technologies with greater capability are constantly introduced and sought by our customers 
it is possible that the introduction of other technologies will either supplant our current technologies and those technologies we have in development or that it will require us to significantly lower our prices in order to remain competitive 
to remain competitive  we need to develop new products that meet the ever changing technology needs of the networking market but that can be sold at a competitive price 
we also must enhance our current products to provide needed features that increase their overall value proposition for the customer while keeping the price competitive 
due to the competitive nature of the market and the relative age of our current product offerings  we may not be able to maintain prices for our products at levels that will sustain profitability over the short or long term 
that may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to sign competitive resale partners internationally could significantly affect future product and service revenue 
because the transition from circuit to packet technology is slower outside the united states  we expect international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our promina r product sales other than that sold in the federal channel in future periods 
our international sales are made almost entirely through indirect channels that include distributors and resellers worldwide 
they do not have minimum purchase requirements that they must meet 
while we require them to use their best efforts to resell our products  because our product line is small  our distributors and resellers must often resell product lines from other networking companies  including our competitors  such as cisco  in order to sustain a profit 
because of the size of cisco and its dominant position in the network equipment market  it is difficult for us to find a distributor or reseller who does not resell cisco products 
due to the difficulty of signing up distributors and resellers without pre existing competitive relationships  our distributors and resellers are not always successful in promoting our products thereby impacting the sustainability of our international product sales 
if we cannot develop relationships with distributors and resellers that can effectively market and sell our products and services  we may not be able to meet our forecasted sales and revenue in future quarters 
our products have long sales cycles making it difficult to predict when a customer will place an order and when to forecast revenue from the related sale 
our products are very complex pieces of networking equipment and represent a significant capital expenditure to our customers 
the purchase of our products can have a significant impact on how a customer designs its network and provides services either within its own organization or to an external customer 
consequently  our customers often engage in extensive testing and evaluation of products before purchase 
there are also numerous financial and budget considerations and approvals that the customer often must obtain before it will issue a purchase order 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle can be quite long  up to a year in some cases 
in addition  our customers  including resellers  have the contractual right to delay scheduled order delivery dates with minimal penalties and to cancel orders within specified time frames without penalty 
the ability to delay or cancel orders makes it difficult to predict whether or not an order may actually ship 
moreover  while customers may tell us that they are planning to purchase our products  to ensure a purchase order is placed  we often must incur substantial sales and marketing expense 
if the order is not placed in the quarter forecasted because approvals took longer than anticipated by the customer  our sales may not meet forecast and revenues may be insufficient in that quarter to meet expenses 
our lack of backlogged product orders make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and creates a risk of carrying too much or too little inventory historically  the majority of our revenue in each quarter has resulted from orders received and shipped in that quarter 
however  for the last two years  we have not started a quarter with a sufficient amount of backlogged orders to meet the sales forecast for that quarter 
while we do not believe that backlog is necessarily indicative of future revenue levels  our customers ordering patterns and the absence of backlogged orders create a significant risk page that we could carry too much or too little inventory if orders do not match forecasts 
rather than base forecasts on orders received  we have been forced to schedule production and commit to certain expenses based more upon forecasts of future sales  which are difficult to predict in the telecommunications industry 
furthermore  if large orders do not close when forecasted or if near term demand weakens for the products we have available to ship  our operating results for that or subsequent quarters would be materially adversely affected 
we have offered and may continue to offer customer financing arrangements 
historically  our customers have been comprised of larger corporate enterprises or well established service providers 
over the past three fiscal years  we have targeted several emerging global carriers  international voice resellers and smaller rural incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs and clecs 
these companies generally do not have substantial operating histories or significant capital resources and often do not qualify for credit from traditional lending sources 
consequently  vendor financing programs have become a competitive factor in obtaining business 
we have worked with customers and third party financial institutions to finance projects through negotiated financing arrangements or leases 
this program includes a loss sharing provision under which there is limited recourse to us in the event of default 
in addition  we entered into a loss sharing agreement with one of our resellers wherein we share in a percentage of any loss arising from a customer s failure to pay the reseller for our equipment 
both of these programs are for companies based in the united states only 
as of march  we had million of outstanding lease financing that was subject to limited recourse provisions 
we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations and demands by lessors under recourse provisions 
any significant increase in the use of vendor financing by our customers or any further degradation of the market in which our customers compete could increase our exposure to credit risk and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to hire qualified new employees or to retain existing employees  then we may not be able to successfully manage our business 
our success is dependent on being able to attract and retain highly skilled engineers  managers and other key employees 
in the past two years we have seen a large turnover in our direct sales force in north america 
this turnover has negatively impacted our ability to sell products in the united states 
until very recently  the tight job market made competition for employees very intense for all employers 
the large job growth in the san francisco bay area and the competition for employees from both established and start up companies has made it difficult for many departments in net 
com including marketing and engineering to attract and recruit new employees in a timely manner 
the recent lay offs at internet and telecommunications companies have improved somewhat our employee retention and recruitment concerns 
while we have put additional focus and resources into our recruitment activities and have taken steps including the introduction of compensation packages and other incentives that we hope will mitigate these competitive advantages  we cannot say that in the current economy our increased efforts will substantially improve the recruitment and retention issues faced by our company at this time 
our inability to attract  recruit and retain key personnel  particularly engineers and sales and marketing employees  could impact our ability to meet important company objectives such as product delivery deadlines and sales targets 
that in turn could significantly impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on a number of sole source suppliers for our component parts 
we purchase key components from single source suppliers  in particular  our back planes  asics and power supplies 
if our sole source suppliers or we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed resulting in decreased revenues 
in addition  if one of these suppliers were no longer able to supply a required component  it could result in our having to significantly reengineer the affected product 
further  due to increased demand and cyclical shortages of capacity in the semiconductor industry  lead times for ordering parts have increased from time to time 
if we encounter shortages or delays in receiving ordered components or if we are not able to accurately forecast our ordering requirements  this could adversely impact our ability to ship ordered products and could ultimately negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
page the availability of uninterrupted electric power could impact our ability and our suppliers ability to maintain our operations in california 
recently  the public electric utility that provides power to our facilities and many of our suppliers facilities has been subject to shortages of electric power 
these shortages have led to dramatic increases in operating costs and have subjected us to unpredictable rolling blackouts where power has been completely interrupted for extended periods of time 
should this power shortage persist  and the frequency of outages increase  it may become more difficult for our subcontract manufacturer and other suppliers to meet delivery commitments 
in addition  continued interruptions of power may impact our ability to deliver new products to the market place on a timely basis 
should the electric utility not be able to secure sufficient power supplies in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we single source our manufacturing process so that a failure or delay by that vendor could impact our ability to timely ship our products 
we currently subcontract some testing and all product manufacturing to one company  solectron 
final test and assembly is generally performed at our fremont  california facility 
while subcontracting creates substantial cost efficiencies in the manufacturing process  it also exposes us to delays in product shipments should solectron be unable to perform under our contract 
in addition  should solectron in some future period decide not to renew our contract with them  it would be difficult for us to quickly transfer our manufacturing requirements to another vendor likely causing substantial delays in customer product shipments and impacting revenue and our results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our business 
our future success depends upon our proprietary technology 
although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  and trade secrets  we cannot predict whether such protection will be adequate  or whether our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights 
as competition in the communications equipment industry increases and the functionality of the products in this industry further overlap  we believe that companies in the communications equipment industry may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
we have received and may continue to receive notice from third parties  including some of our competitors  claiming that we are infringing their patents or their other proprietary rights 
we cannot predict whether we will prevail in any litigation over third party claims  or that we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents on commercially reasonable terms 
any of these claims  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  divert our management s time  attention and resources  delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  a third party may not be willing to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a claim of product infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non infringing technology  it could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we need to continue to license products from third parties 
for our promina  shoutip and scream products  we license some of our technology from third party suppliers 
if the relevant licensing agreement expires or is terminated without our being able to renew that license  that failure to renew the license could impact our ability to market the affected product and that  in turn  could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulations and tariffs 
changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could affect the sales of our products 
in the united states  our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations 
in countries outside of the united states  our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities 
changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  there are currently few laws or regulations that govern access or commerce on the internet 
if individual countries  or groups of countries  acting in concert began to impose regulations or standards on internet access or page commerce including voice over ip  this could materially impact our ability to sell our new scream and shoutip products or other new products if the regulations or standards resulted in decreased demand or increased costs for our products 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non dollar denominated sales in the united kingdom  france  and germany and non dollar denominated operating expenses in europe  latin america  and asia where we sell primarily in united states dollars 
the increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european union could impact our foreign exchange exposure 
we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary 
we are currently not hedging our exposure to the euro or any other foreign currency but will continue to evaluate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our future foreign exchange exposure as well as our internal systems 
the location of our facilities subjects us to the risk of earthquake and floods 
our corporate headquarters  including most of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities  are located in the silicon valley area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
additionally  these facilities are located near the san francisco bay where the water table is quite close to the surface and where we have experienced water intrusion problems 
in particular  defects in the construction of our facilities combined with the proximity to water will force us to move out of these facilities in the first half of the calendar year 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the completion of the activities necessary to effect the move to our new compus may cause interruption to our business a new building campus is currently under construction and will become the new corporate headquarters for net 
com sometime in the first half of the calendar year 
moving substantially all of our r d development activities including the development labs  and all of our in house manufacturing capability represents significant risk as it exposes the company to potential disruptions and delays in business  engineering  and manufacturing operations 
while the costs of construction  and the move will be substantially paid for out of insurance proceeds  problems with the move could interrupt communications preventing the company from processing orders  or it could impact engineering development schedules  or prevent manufacturing operations from shipping product 
in addition  certain contingencies associated with our negotiated move out of our current facilities  not all of which have been satisfied  may result in our move not proceeding as planned 
any problems  interruptions or delays associated with the move could have a material adverse impact on business  operating results  and financial condition 
the upgrade of our information technology infrastructure may expose the company to disruption of operations 
we are in the process of upgrading and consolidating our core business process systems onto a new oracle erp platform that is scheduled to go live in the july to august time frame 
we expect to incur significant costs relating to this upgrade 
the scope of this project includes our order management  financial  human resource  quality  and manufacturing systems  and encompasses our global operations 
the purpose of the project is to consolidate several legacy systems into one  to enable more effective decision support capabilities and to allow us to scale our business more cost effectively 
any significant problems experienced with the turn on of the new systems could prevent us from timely processing orders and shipping products 
these problems could impact the quarter s revenue and customer relations and could have a material adverse impact on business  operating results  and financial condition
