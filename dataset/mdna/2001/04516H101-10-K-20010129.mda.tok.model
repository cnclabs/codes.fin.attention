fluctuations in the currency rates between the united kingdom and those other countries give rise to a loss or gain that is reported in earnings

ashworth canada sells ashworth products within canada with the revenues denominated in canadian dollars and ordinarily there is no transaction adjustment for currency exchange rates for the company 
all export revenues by ashworth  inc are us dollar denominated and ordinarily there is no transaction adjustment for currency exchange rate for the company 
however  with respect to export revenues to ashworth uk  ltd 
and ashworth canada  the foreign subsidiaries are at risk on their indebtedness to ashworth  inc the subsidiaries maintain their accounts with ashworth  inc  in british pounds or canadian dollars  but owe ashworth  inc in us dollars 
at the end of every accounting period  the debt is adjusted to british pounds or canadian dollars by multiplying the indebtedness by the closing british pound us dollar or pound us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate to ensure that the account has sufficient british pounds or canadian dollars to meet its us dollar obligation

the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets and the value of the us dollars of sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for the company s products or losses from currency exchange rates 
from time to time  the company enters into short term foreign exchange contracts with its bank to hedge against the impact of currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound 
the contracts provide that  on specified dates  the company would sell the bank a specified number of british pounds in exchange for a specified number of us dollars 
additionally  the company s subsidiary in england enters into similar contracts with its bank to hedge against currency fluctuations between the british pound and other european currencies 
realized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction 
these contracts have maturity dates that do not normally exceed months 
the company will continue to assess the benefits and risks of strategies to manage the risks presented by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there is no assurance that any strategy will be successful in avoiding losses due to exchange rate fluctuations  or that the failure to manage currency risks effectively would not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
as of october  the company had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
