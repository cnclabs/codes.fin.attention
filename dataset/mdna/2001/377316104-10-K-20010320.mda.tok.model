overview the company classifies its sales into two product groups specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
the glatfelter division  which includes the spring grove  pennsylvania and neenah  wisconsin paper mills  produces both specialized printing and engineered papers 
the ecusta division is comprised of the pisgah forest  north carolina paper mill ecusta as well as other various supporting facilities 
s h  acquired on january   includes paper mills in gernsbach  germany and scaer  france 
both ecusta and s h produce specialized printing papers and engineered papers including tobacco papers 
the company is in the process of changing its organization and information systems to manage its business in four separate business units engineered products  printing and converting papers  long fiber and overlay papers and tobacco papers 
the company s information systems do not currently provide the information necessary for reporting by business unit 
such information is expected to be available by the end of despite some market related downtime in the first and second quarters and a decrease in the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter  demand for the company s products overall remained stable throughout demand for the company s tobacco papers  however  continued to be weak during this portion of the company s business has suffered from extremely low pricing in recent years as a result of overcapacity in the tobacco papers industry and declining domestic consumption of tobacco products 
to combat such depressed pricing  the company announced in september that  effective january   prices would be increased for certain of its tobacco paper products 
this initiative was required for the company to remain a viable  high quality supplier to its customers 
as the company expected  certain of these customers sought other suppliers after this announcement 
as a result  the company announced in december that it would begin reducing its tobacco paper manufacturing capacity at its ecusta mill during in the first quarter of  the company recognized a one time  pre tax restructuring charge of  related primarily to the cost of offering early retirement to salaried employees 
to date  approximately salaried and hourly jobs have been eliminated 
the company does not expect to complete the restructuring until april with an ultimate reduction estimated at approximately jobs 
despite the decline in the company s tobacco papers business  demand has not diminished as swiftly as expected  and the announced price increases have held relatively firm 
the company expects  however  that in the long run net sales of tobacco papers will continue to trend downward 
future price changes will be determined based on contractual provisions to reflect changes in market pulp prices 
to offset the loss of tobacco paper volume  the company has been growing its specialized printing papers business 
it also plans to grow its engineered papers business and has invested resources into its new product development area 
despite the company s expectations that the reduction of its tobacco paper producing capacity would reduce its total sales volume in the near term  sales of the glatfelter and s h divisions more than offset such capacity reduction 
the company is continuing to remove costs associated with the lost tobacco papers business 
the company s other engineered papers  excluding tobacco papers  are often difficult to characterize because the products vary widely 
overall  markets for such papers remained steady throughout  and the short term outlook appears stable 
nevertheless  volume for these papers decreased slightly in compared to most of the company s specialized printing paper products are directed at the uncoated free sheet portion of the industry 
with the exception of some second quarter softening in demand for envelope papers  demand for the company s printing papers remained strong through most of backlogs decreased in december and remained weak through january this is not uncommon during the winter months  however  current domestic and worldwide economic conditions create some concern regarding demand for the next several months 
the company expects demand to improve and backlogs to increase later in the year 
the company announced a price increase for a substantial number of its specialized printing papers effective in early february the company had anticipated additional price increases through the remainder of  but softening demand in the second quarter resulted in some slippage in pricing 
by early in the fourth quarter of pricing recovered somewhat  particularly in the company s trade book papers 
compared to overall  net sales in increased  or  compared to though net sales volume was slightly higher in versus  the majority of the net sales increase in was due to an increase in average net selling price 
sales of specialized printing papers were higher in than by  primarily due to a increase in average net selling prices resulting from improved pricing and product mix 
increased demand for these papers resulted in increased net sales volume 
sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers fell by in versus  as a decrease in net sales volume was slightly offset by a small increase in average net selling price 
this decrease was largely due to a decrease in net sales of tobacco papers 
the cost of products sold increased by in compared to with energy costs abnormally high and market pulp price increases uncharacteristically outpacing selling price increases  the company would have expected cost of products sold from to to have increased more than the net sales increase 
pension income reduced cost of products sold by  in compared to  in in addition  implementation of the company s drive project has reduced cost of products sold 
as of december   the company had implemented portions of the drive project that will realize over  per year in sustainable cash cost savings 
the company s ultimate goal is to realize over  per year in such savings 
primarily as a result of the increase in pension income and cost savings associated with the drive project  gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for from for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  in versus was due primarily to increased spending on outside consulting services relating to the company s drive and impact projects 
profit from operations before interest income and expense and taxes was  excluding the unusual item in compared to  in this increase was driven primarily by improved profit margins at the glatfelter and s h divisions as increased sales volume spread fixed costs over a greater number of tons produced and sold 
the ecusta division experienced lower sales volume  which decreased profit margins  thus partially negating the gains of the other divisions 
the strengthening of the us dollar with respect to the deutsche mark dm in also adversely affected earnings as foreign profits translated into fewer dollars 
finally  savings from the company s drive project contributed significantly to profits  but such savings were offset by the additional consulting costs incurred in the company expects that its drive savings will continue to increase through additionally  a significant portion of the consulting costs incurred for the company s impact project will be capitalized during interest on investments and other net nearly doubled in from from  to  the company s average cash holdings in were significantly higher than in  yielding higher interest income 
additionally  cash was invested in higher yielding debt instruments throughout as compared to gain from property dispositions  etc 
net for decreased to about half of the gain from  to  in the first quarter of  the company sold a tract of timberland  realizing a gain of  during the remainder of  the company sold various fully depreciated items  in addition to the rights to standing timber on select tracts of land 
subsequent to the first quarter of  no single sale was material to the company s results of operations 
no significant sales of such properties occurred in from time to time  the company divests certain tracts of its timberlands when it is offered attractive prices 
the company does not actively solicit the sale of its timberlands as it currently intends to maintain its own sources of raw materials 
interest on debt was  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower average borrowings  offset partially by higher interest rates 
such lower average borrowings were related to an decrease in short term debt stemming from payments made 
additionally  a stronger us dollar relative to the dm during caused lower reported interest expense 
compared to overall  net sales in decreased  or  compared to though net sales volume was higher in versus  average net pricing was lower in sales of specialized printing papers were lower in than by as a result of weak demand and pricing for such products early in throughout the remainder of  the company was able to implement several price increases as demand and pricing improved during the year 
as a result of these price increases  average net pricing for such products was higher in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of sales of engineered papers including tobacco papers increased by less than in versus  as an increase in net sales volume was substantially offset by a decrease in average net selling price 
the increase in volume was largely a result of successfully marketing certain of the company s existing products 
as mentioned above  the company  along with much of the rest of the paper industry  experienced weakness in demand for many of its products early in as a result  the company accepted orders for certain of its products with lower average net selling prices 
the decrease in average net selling price for the year  therefore  was almost entirely a result of a change in mix of products sold and not a weakening of prices for specific products 
the cost of products sold decreased by in compared to  in part due to aggressive steps taken to remove costs from its business 
further  an increase in operational efficiency at many of the company s operating locations was realized as a result of an improving and more stable order pattern for many of the company s products 
in addition  market pulp prices  a key raw material in the company s business  were lower  on average  than in pension income reduced cost of products sold by  in compared to  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  in versus was primarily a result of additional spending on legal and professional services relating to certain environmental and other matters 
profit from operations before interest income and expense and taxes was  in compared to  excluding the unusual item in this decrease was largely due to the decrease in net sales in versus  partially offset by a decrease in cost of products sold 
interest on investments and other net remained flat from to the company s average cash holdings in were higher than in  yielding higher interest income 
offsetting this was interest income realized in on a trust held to defease certain of the company s debt 
the defeasance trust was liquidated early in  and no such income was realized in gain from property dispositions  etc 
net increased from  in to  in in the first quarter of  the company sold a tract of timberland  realizing a gain of  during the remainder of  the company sold various fully depreciated items  in addition to the rights to standing timber on select tracts of land 
subsequent to the first quarter of  no single sale was material to the company s results of operations 
no significant sales of such property occurred in interest on debt was  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower average reported borrowings and generally lower interest rates experienced in versus such lower average borrowings were partially a result of the company s repayment of its  principal amount of notes early in as well as strengthening of the us dollar relative to the dm during unusual items the company s tobacco papers business has suffered from extremely low pricing in recent years as a result of overcapacity in the tobacco papers industry and declining domestic consumption of tobacco products 
to combat such depressed pricing  the company announced in september that  effective january   prices would be increased for certain of its tobacco paper products 
this initiative was required for the company to remain a viable  high quality supplier to its tobacco paper customers 
as the company expected  certain of these customers sought other suppliers after this announcement 
as a result  the company announced in december that it would begin reducing its tobacco paper manufacturing capacity at its ecusta mill during during the first quarter of  the company finalized its plan of restructuring and shortly thereafter began to reduce the workforce at ecusta 
the workforce reduction is substantially completed and will ultimately result in the reduction of over salaried and hourly jobs associated with the company s tobacco paper production capacity 
this reduction in jobs is lower than originally estimated due to stronger customer demand than anticipated 
the company accrued and charged to expense   after tax  or 
per share in the first quarter of primarily as a result of the voluntary portion  specifically salaried employees  of this restructuring 
the amount of actual termination benefits paid and charged against the liability as of december  was  covering salaried employees 
during  the company recognized a charge of  related primarily to the accrual of pension and medical benefits for certain salaried and hourly employees of the ecusta division and certain salaried employees of the glatfelter division who elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement enhancement program 
the charge also included the cost of termination of several glatfelter division salaried employees  which was necessary to achieve the company s cost savings goals
