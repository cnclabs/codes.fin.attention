item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report and contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in factors affecting future results elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our objective is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of products used to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases 
our strategy consists of integrating our core antigen  monoclonal antibody  adjuvant  antigen delivery and tumor activated  or tap pro drug technologies into a strong product pipeline 
to implement this strategy  we develop select technologies and potential products ourselves and establish corporate collaborations for other select technologies at various stages in the research and development process  including partnerships for discovery  clinical development  manufacturing and marketing 
we believe that this development and partner driven approach will create significant scientific  operational and financial advantages and accelerate the commercial development of new therapeutic and prophylactic immunotherapeutic products 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue resulted from collaborative agreements  and approximately  and  of our revenue resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   we had total stockholders equity of million 
we have entered into  and intend to continue to enter into  collaborative agreements at various stages in the research and development process 
we believe that this active corporate partnering strategy enables us to maintain our focus on our fundamental strengths in discovery and research of immunotherapeutic products  focus on selected technologies and potential products that we elect to develop ourselves  capitalize on our corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  retain significant downstream participation in product sales  and reduce our financing requirements 
when entering into corporate partnering relationships  we seek to cover our research and development expenses through research funding  milestone payments  collaborative agreement credit lines  and technology and license fees 
we also endeavor to retain significant downstream participation in product sales through either profit sharing or product royalties paid on annual net sales 
our significant collaborative agreements include the following medicis and zenyaku kogyo 
in august  we entered into a multi year development  commercialization and license agreement covering our psoriasis immunotherapeutic product  pvac tm treatment  with medicis pharmaceutical corporation medicis 
the agreement provides medicis with exclusive rights to pvac treatment in the united states and canada 
we will be responsible for development and manufacturing  and medicis will be responsible for commercialization and distribution 
under the terms of the agreement  medicis will pay us license fees  research funding and milestone payments of up to million 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  we received a nonrefundable payment of million with additional potential development milestone payments of million  and commercialization and cumulative net sales threshold milestone payments of million 
additionally  upon commercial sale of the product  medicis will purchase inventory from us and pay a royalty on net sales of the product 
in august  we entered into a corporate partnership with zenyaku kogyo for research and development related to pvac treatment 
the agreement provides zenyaku kogyo with exclusive rights to pvac treatment in japan 
under the terms of the agreement  we will receive license fees and research funding of million  milestone payments based on successful clinical and commercial progress  and a royalty stream on future product sales 
zambon group and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco 
during may and june  we entered into corporate partnerships with zambon group  or zambon and the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  respectively  for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at preventing and or treating lung cancer 
zambon has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in europe  the former countries of the soviet union  argentina  brazil and columbia and co exclusive rights with japan tobacco in china 
japan tobacco has exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products outside of the territory licensed to zambon  including the united states and japan  and co exclusive rights to develop and sell vaccine products in china 
we also granted zambon a nonexclusive license and japan tobacco an option to formulate vaccines that may result from the collaboration using our microsphere delivery system with our proprietary adjuvants 
the agreements have three year terms and  in the aggregate  provide for committed research funding of million  as well as milestone payments that vary depending on the milestones achieved 
in addition  zambon purchased million of our common stock 
the agreement allows zambon to sell the common stock back to us at the original price at the end of the research program term if zambon determines that a commercial product is not viable 
infectious disease research institute 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with the idri  to research and develop ex vivo therapies for treating cancer 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  idri committed million of research funding over the agreement s three year term 
the agreement provides us with exclusive rights to all resulting intellectual property and product rights 
idri will receive a percentage of our proceeds related to ex vivo therapy products resulting from such research and development 
glaxosmithkline 
during  we entered into a broad corporate partnership with glaxosmithkline s  or gsk s  wholly owned subsidiary  smithkline beecham plc  for vaccine discovery for breast  prostate  ovarian and colon cancer  tuberculosis vaccine discovery and development programs  and vaccine discovery programs for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae 
we also granted gsk an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and sell vaccine products resulting from our clinical program based on her neu for treating breast and ovarian cancer  as well as our preclinical program based on mammaglobin  a novel gene product associated with breast cancer 
for certain of these disease areas  we granted gsk rights to develop  manufacture and sell passive immunotherapy products 
these products include t cell  dendritic cell and antibody therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring products 
gsk has committed million to fund work in such discovery programs during the agreement s four year research term 
we have several license and supply agreements with gsk  granting gsk licenses to certain adjuvants for use in vaccines for infectious diseases  cancer and allergy that gsk is developing 
these agreements grant gsk exclusive and co exclusive license rights depending on the disease field and territory 
under the terms of the agreement  gsk pays annual license fees  milestones  transfer payments and future royalty payments 
as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we acquired the collaboration agreement between coulter and gsk s wholly owned subsidiary  smithkline beecham corporation  for developing and commercializing bexxar  which has completed phase iii clinical trials in the united states and is the subject of a bla currently under review by the food and drug administration  or fda  for treating non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
the agreement was amended in april to reduce gsk s territory under the agreement to the united states 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we and gsk will jointly market and sell bexxar in the united states following regulatory approval  and the two companies will share profits and losses equally 
the agreement provides for the sharing of certain costs related to clinical and manufacturing development activities 
the agreement also provides for a million credit line  which was fully drawn in december we may receive additional payments if we achieve certain clinical development and regulatory milestones 
as of december   no milestone payments have been earned or received 
we and gsk will annually prepare a joint profit and loss statement to account for the sharing of revenue  costs of goods sold and costs relating to selling  marketing  and distribution  and certain other bexxar related activities 
development expenses for bexxar will generally be shared by both companies  although we retain responsibility to fully fund certain development costs 
we have acquired the following companies coulter 
on december   we acquired coulter  a biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing novel drugs and therapies for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases 
we purchased coulter for approximately million  which consideration consisted of approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million  assumed coulter stock options valued at million  less million associated with the intrinsic value of unvested options  and transaction costs of approximately million 
the million was recorded as deferred compensation and will be amortized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods of up to four years 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  which includes goodwill of million  an assumed lease arrangement of million and an assembled workforce charge of million 
the fda accepted the bla filing for coulter s lead product  bexxar  in november if we do not receive fda approval for bexxar  a significant portion of the value assigned to acquired in process research and development will not be realized and the value assigned to the intangible assets related to this acquisition will be impaired 
ribi 
on october   we completed the acquisition of ribi  a pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel agents that modulate the human immune response to prevent or treat certain diseases  including cancer  infectious diseases and cardiovascular injury 
we purchased ribi for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares of our common stock and stock options valued at million  cash of million paid by us to ribi for the redemption of ribi series a preferred stock and transaction costs of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million and acquisition related intangibles of million  which includes goodwill of million  adjuvant know how of million and workforce charge of million 
on february  we agreed in principle to settle lawsuits with the united states and the state of montana related to groundwater contamination for million 
anergen 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of anergen  a biotechnology company focused on treating autoimmune diseases through the discovery and development of proprietary therapeutics that selectively interrupt the disease process 
we purchased anergen for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million  approximately  in cash and approximately  in transaction costs 
we recorded an acquired in process research and development charge of million as a result of the acquisition 
genquest 
on september   we completed the acquisition of genquest  a development stage biotechnology company focused on applying functional genomics technology to discover novel genes and to develop the potential of such genes and related gene products to be used in diagnosis  drug screening  gene therapy and antibody development in the areas of prostate  breast  lung  colon and ovarian cancer 
we purchased genquest for approximately million  which consideration consisted of  shares of our common stock  with a market value of approximately million  approximately million in cash  and transaction costs of approximately  an acquired in process research and development charge of million was recorded as a result of the acquisition 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of acquired in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of coulter  ribi  anergen and genquest 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over  the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with our discovery  research and development programs and the purchase of technology 
substantially all of our revenue to date has resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on entering into collaborative agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
we may be unable to achieve consistent profitability 
in addition  payments under collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amounts  resulting in quarters of profitability and quarters of losses 
therefore  our operating results for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the operating results for any other period 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue our revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in the increase is primarily due to revenue recognized from collaborative agreements with gsk  the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  medicis and purdue pharma 
we attribute the increase compared with primarily to revenue from collaborative agreements with the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  zambon  zenyaku kogyo and idri 
revenue under government grants in was million  up from million in and million in we expect revenue to fluctuate in the future depending on our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements and uncertainty surrounding potential product sales 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees 
revenue for and was recognized under our previous method of accounting 
see change in accounting principle below 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   up from million in and from million in the increase is primarily the result of increased payroll and personnel expenses attributable in part to our acquisitions  new technology acquisition expenses  increased clinical trial expenses related to pvac treatment  melacine and anergix and increased preclinical research activities 
the increase compared with is primarily attributable to increased payroll and personnel expenses  increased collaboration expenses  increased costs associated with preclinical research activities and increased facilities costs as a result of the completion of our seattle facility expansion in late we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as the level of clinical and preclinical research activities continue to expand  in addition to our expanded operations resulting from the coulter acquisition 
we recorded deferred compensation of million associated with the coulter acquisition  which represents the amortization of the value of the unearned options of coulter employees existing at the date of acquisition 
deferred compensation will be amortized over the remaining vesting period with approximately million of amortization expected to be included in research and development expense in sales  general and administrative expenses our sales  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in the increases were primarily attributable to increased payroll and personnel expenses due in part to acquisitions and legal fees 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of our business activities as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities  and as a result of the coulter acquisition 
we expect approximately million of deferred compensation amortization related to the coulter acquisition to be included in sales  general and administrative expense in amortization of acquisition related intangibles our intangible amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from  in the intangible amortization for consisted of million associated with the ribi acquisition and associated with the coulter acquisition for the period december  through december  we expect approximately million of intangible amortization in as a result of the acquisitions of coulter and ribi 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended december   acquired in process research and development ipr d expense increased to million from million in and from million in the million reflects the amount allocated to ipr d that we acquired in the coulter acquisition compared with million in the ribi and anergen acquisitions in and million in the genquest acquisition in acquired ipr d for each of the above acquisitions represents the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased technology  which  at the acquisition dates  had not yet reached technological feasibility 
the cash flow projections for revenues were based on estimates of growth rates and the aggregate size of the respective markets for each product  probability of technical success given the stage of development at the time of acquisition  royalty rates based on prior licensing agreements  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses and income taxes were deducted from estimated revenue projections to arrive at estimated after tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses include general and administrative expenses  and research and development costs 
the rate utilized to discount projected cash flows ranged from to for in process technologies and was based primarily on venture capital rates of return and the weighted average cost of capital for us at the time of acquisition 
at the acquisition date  coulter s ipr d projects consisted of the following bexxar  which consists of a radioisotope  iodine  or i  combined with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes and binds to the cd antigen  an antigen commonly expressed on the surface of b cells primarily during that stage of their life cycle when nhl arises 
bexxar is administered to patients in a proprietary therapeutic protocol consisting of a single  two dose regimen 
coulter previously estimated that research and development costs to complete individual bexxar development projects would be approximately million  net of reimbursements from gsk 
the most advanced application of bexxar is for treating relapsed and refractory low grade and transformed low grade nhl for which phase iii clinical trials have been completed  and a bla was accepted for review by the fda in november additional indications include first line low grade nhl treatment and intermediate grade nhl  which are estimated to be completed in significant risk remains in relation to fda approval of bexxar 
g is a monoclonal antibody that binds to sub unit one of the type i interferon receptor and neutralizes the activity of all type i interferons 
this antibody  or a derivative  may provide therapeutic benefit in a number of autoimmune diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  systemic lupus erythematosus  crohn s disease  graft versus host disease and solid organ transplantation rejection 
coulter previously estimated that an individual g project may be completed by with an additional million required in research and development expenditures 
prior to the acquisition  coulter had made progress demonstrating efficacy of g in preclinical studies using animal models for rheumatoid arthritis and tissue transplantation rejection 
cpi is a tumor activated peptide  or tap  pro drug version of doxorubicin 
doxorubicin is an off patent chemotherapeutic drug that currently is used in treating a number of solid tumor cancers  including breast  prostate  ovarian and soft tissue sarcoma cancers 
cpi is a proprietary molecule based on a peptide of four amino acids that is linked to doxorubicin 
cpi is designed to deliver significantly higher levels of doxorubicin to a tumor site relative to normal tissues 
the tap pro drug approach is also designed to achieve a higher dose of active drug at the tumor site than can be achieved using unconjugated drug 
coulter previously estimated that the cpi project may be completed by with an additional million in research and development expenditures 
this project is currently scheduled to complete preclinical development and to be ready to commence phase i clinical trials in the second half of at the acquisition date  ribi s ipr d projects consisted of mpl  an adjuvant immunostimulant for potential application in improving the efficacy of a variety of vaccines that are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development  rc  a next generation synthetic adjuvant  melacine  a therapeutic vaccine to treat melanoma  enhanzyn tm  which is being developed by biomira for use in melacine vaccine and in theratope  as a therapeutic vaccine for breast  lung  gastrointestinal and colon cancer  and rc  a synthetic compound that is being developed for use in protecting against reperfusion injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery or angioplasty 
in november  we received approval of melacine for treating stage iv malignant melanoma in canada 
in march  we also received data from us phase iii clinical trials for melacine for treating stage ii and stage iv malignant melanoma 
in january  we entered into a license  development and commercialization agreement for our cardioprotectant  rc tm 
under the terms of the agreement  copharma will develop and commercialize rc for treating and preventing cardiac disorders  neuronal damage and ischemia reperfusion injuries 
at the acquisition date  anergen s ipr d projects were potential therapies for treating autoimmune diseases that focus on destroying or inactivating t cells without affecting the protective functions of the immune system and or stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that may interfere with the presentation of auto antigens to destructive t cells 
anergix 
ra  under development in partnership with organon  is the most advanced product 
anergix 
ra is a soluble version of the human leucocyte antigen hla class ii containing an autoantigenic peptide known to interact with t cells involved in the development of arthritis 
anergix 
ra is designed to inactivate t cells responsible for developing arthritic lesions 
anergix 
ra completed a randomized  double blinded  controlled phase i ii clinical trial in anervax 
ra is a synthetic peptide vaccine consisting of a small portion of the hla class ii molecule 
anervax 
ra has completed a patient randomized phase ii double blinded clinical trial 
at the date of acquisition  genquest s primary ipr d projects related to functional genomics technology to discover and develop novel genes and related gene products to be used in diagnostics and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
these potential products are in the areas of prostate  breast  lung  colon and ovarian cancer 
we based all of the estimates and projections related to the ipr d projects for coulter  ribi  anergen and genquest on assumptions we believed to be reasonable at the time of each acquisition but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
if we do not successfully develop these projects  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
as of the date of each acquisition  we concluded that once completed  the technologies under development can only be economically used for their specific and intended purposes and that such in process technologies have no alternative future use after taking into consideration the overall objectives of the project  progress toward the objectives  and uniqueness of developments to these objectives 
if the projects fail  the economic contribution expected to be made by the in process research and development will not materialize 
the risk of untimely completion includes the risk that competitors will develop alternative products 
interest income our interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in and from million in the change in interest income is based on average investment balances during the year and market interest rates 
interest expense our interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in and from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher loan and capital lease financing balances 
other income our other income was  for the year ended december  compared with  in and  in other income for includes a gain of  on the partial sale of our investment in immgenics and  in sublease rental receipts 
other income for includes  and  in proceeds from the recovery of a collaboration receivable that was previously charged to expense and sublease rental receipts  respectively 
the amount includes  and  in proceeds from management and administrative service agreements with genquest and idri  respectively 
during  we provided services to idri with respect to corporate management  accounting and financial matters  record keeping  personnel administration and human resources  and treasury services 
similar services were performed under the genquest agreement  which ended upon our acquisition of genquest 
change in accounting principle effective january   we changed our method of accounting for nonrefundable up front license fees to recognize such fees over the term of the related research and development collaboration arrangement on a straight line basis  as this method best matches the effort provided 
the million cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  calculated as of january   was reported as a charge in the year ended december  the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the remaining term of the research and development collaboration agreements 
in september  we recognized a multi million dollar nonrefundable up front license fee 
this amount has been reversed and will be recognized over the term of the related research and development arrangements 
for the year ended december   the impact of the change in accounting was to increase net loss by million  or per share  comprised of the million cumulative effect of the change as described above per share and million of revenue recognized in the third quarter of and subsequently reversed per share less million of the deferred revenue related to the cumulative effect adjustment that was recognized as revenue during the year per share 
the remainder of the related deferred revenue will be recognized as follows million in  million in and million in had the change in accounting been in effect retroactively as of january   net loss for the years ended december  and would have been million  or per share  and million  or per share  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funding from collaborative agreements and the issuance of equity securities and debt instruments 
our october initial public offering and preceding private placements of equity securities have provided us with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
net proceeds of million were generated by our follow on public offering in april through the issuance of  shares of our common stock at per share 
for the previous three years  we have received cash of approximately million from collaborative research agreements and grants  million from the issuance of series a and series b preferred stock under an equity line of credit  million from a bank loan and million from credit lines under collaborative agreements 
in april  we entered into an agreement with castle gate  an investment partnership focused primarily on health care and biomedical companies  to provide us with an equity line of credit of up to million 
under the agreement  castle gate was obligated to provide the equity line through march at the time we executed the agreement  we completed an initial draw down of million and a corresponding issuance to castle gate of  shares of series a preferred stock  which are convertible into common stock at per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have exercise prices of and per share 
on december   we drew down the remaining million under the equity line of credit  and in exchange for the funds  issued to castle gate  shares of our series b preferred stock  which are convertible into common stock at per share  and warrants to purchase  and  shares of our common stock  each at an exercise price of per share 
on the date of the initial draw  the effective conversion price of the preferred stock after allocating a portion of the proceeds to the common stock warrants based on the relative fair values was at a discount to the price of the common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible 
the discount of million was recorded as a preferred stock dividend 
on the date of the second draw  the effective conversion price of the preferred stock after allocating a portion of the proceeds to the common stock warrants based on the relative fair values was at a discount to the price of the common stock into which the preferred stock is convertible 
the discount of million was recorded as a preferred stock dividend 
in addition  we have paid preferred stock dividends of  to date related to the annual cumulative dividend and have accrued a dividend of  at december   payable in april during the year ended december   we used million of cash in our operations  compared with million in and million in our investing activities used million  compared to million in and million in the increases in cash used in investing activities were primarily due to the increased use of cash to purchase available for sale securities 
our financing activities provided cash of million in compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to proceeds of million from our follow on public offering of common stock  our issuance of series b preferred stock of million and proceeds from long term and short term obligations of million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily the result of our issuance of series a preferred stock  partially offset by a decrease in borrowings 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
working capital increased to million at december  from million in and million in for the years ended december   and  we invested million  million and million  respectively  in property and equipment 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under our existing collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of capital will be sufficient for such period of time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others continued scientific progress in our discovery  research and product development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  our ability to maintain existing  and enter into additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of acquiring companies with complementary technology  the costs associated with potential commercial activities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products and other factors not within our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
however  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our discovery  research or development programs  any of which could harm our business 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
recent developments on march   after receipt of a complete review letter from the fda  we announced a delay in the potential launch of bexxar 
consequently  we have modified our operating plan and initiated expense reductions  including a reduction in our workforce 
as a result of this workforce reduction  we expect to incur a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of market risk disclosures interest rate risk the table below summarizes the estimated effects on certain assets and liabilities based on hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table estimated hypothetical fair value after hypothetical change in hypothetical percentage fair value at interest rate change in decrease in december  bp basis points interest rate stockholders equity in thousands assets us government agencies and corporate obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  liabilities debt obligations  bp decrease  bp increase  bp increase  bp increase  less than important factors that may affect our business  our results of operations and our stock price 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all other information contained and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results may be seriously harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock may decline 
our success depends on our products being approved through a government regulatory approval process that is uncertain  time consuming and expensive  and if any of our products are not approved  our business may suffer 
any products that we or our corporate partners develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we or our corporate partners develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
if any of our products are not approved by the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we are seeking to market our products  our business may suffer 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product in order to study its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
the timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our products depend on  among other factors  the rate at which patients are enrolled  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to the clinical sites  the number of clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  and the existence of competing clinical trials 
we cannot assure you that delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials will not occur 
any delays may result in increased costs  program delays or both  which may harm our business 
the fda accepted the bexxar tm bla on november   and assigned the application six month priority review status 
the fda granted bexxar orphan drug designation in may  as well as fast track designation announced in december on march   we received a complete review letter from the fda following the agency s review of the bexxar bla 
issuance of the complete review letter satisfied the fda s performance goal for priority review under the prescription drug user fee act 
in the complete review letter  the fda outlined additional clinical and manufacturing information that corixa must submit as a result of the review 
the fda requested updated and or final safety and efficacy data from ongoing  recently completed  and other additional trials to establish safety and effectiveness 
our inability to complete further studies or gather further evidence  or a failure of any clinical trials to yield acceptable results may further delay approval of bexxar 
any such delays may result in increased costs or further delays to approval or both  which may harm our business 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
data from a phase iii clinical trial of melacine r  our melanoma vaccine  with the primary endpoint being the comparison of disease free survival between patients with stage ii melanoma who  following surgical removal  received melacine vaccine versus observation only  found no statistically significant difference in disease free survival of the eligible patient population 
however  the results of the intent to treat analysis on the total population indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in disease free survival 
in september  we announced our intent to file a bla for the use of melacine vaccine for treating stage ii melanoma 
in addition  we recently completed a phase ii clinical trial for our pvac tm treatment for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis 
we are currently developing a new set of trials to further study the effectiveness of pvac treatment for the treatment of psoriasis 
we cannot assure you that pvac treatment will prove to be an effective treatment for psoriasis  or even if efficacy is demonstrated in clinical trial  that it will be approved by the fda for commercial sale 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based on changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development  extension of the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or other factors beyond our control 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of any products we or our corporate partners develop  could impose significant additional costs on us or our corporate partners  would diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and could adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the approved product may be marketed 
these limitations could reduce the size of the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
further  manufacturers of approved products are subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with detailed fda regulations governing good manufacturing practices  or gmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market  which could adversely affect sales of the affected products 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn  reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products or changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  sales of the affected products may drop significantly  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and lawsuits  including class action suits  may be brought against us 
any of the above occurrences could harm our business 
acceptance of bexxar tm in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will harm our business 
if our most advanced product candidate  bexxar  is approved  it would represent a significant departure from currently approved methods of treatment for nhl and would require medical personnel to handle radioactive materials 
accordingly  bexxar may experience under utilization by oncologists and hematologists who are unfamiliar with the application of bexxar in treating nhl 
further  oncologists and hematologists are not typically licensed to administer radioimmunotherapies such as bexxar and will need to engage a nuclear medicine physician or receive specialty training to administer bexxar 
nuclear regulatory commission regulations permit bexxar to be administered on an outpatient basis in most cases as is currently contemplated by us 
however  market acceptance could be affected adversely because some hospitals may be required to administer the therapeutic dose of bexxar on an in patient basis under applicable state  local or individual hospital regulations 
as with any new drug  doctors may be inclined to continue to treat patients with conventional therapies  in this case chemotherapy and biologics 
market acceptance also could be affected by the availability of third party reimbursement 
failure of bexxar to achieve market acceptance would harm our business 
we are at an early stage of development and have limited sources of revenue 
we are at an early stage in the development of the majority of our therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic products 
to date  almost all of our revenue has resulted from payments made under agreements with our corporate partners  and we expect that most of our revenue will continue to result from corporate partnerships until therapeutic product approval and commercialization 
since our inception  we have generated only minimal revenue from diagnostic product sales and no revenue from therapeutic or prophylactic product sales 
with the exception of melacine r  which is available for sale in canada  we cannot predict when  if ever  our research and development programs will result in commercially available immunotherapeutic products 
we do not know when  if ever  we will receive any significant revenue from commercial sales of these products 
we may not receive anticipated revenue under existing corporate partnerships  and we may be unable to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 
we may be unable to develop products successfully 
the development of safe and effective therapies for treating people with autoimmune diseases  cancer or infectious diseases is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
product candidates that may appear to be promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality or may fail to achieve market acceptance 
we are at an early stage in the development of the majority of our products  and we cannot assure you that clinical trials of our product candidates under development will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of those products to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for the indications being studied  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of the products under development by us could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product and may harm our business 
we have several preclinical programs and several potential products in clinical trials 
we also have two potential products  melacine vaccine and bexxar therapy  that have completed clinical trials 
we cannot assure you that any of these programs will yield products that are approved for commercial sale or that any of these potential products  with the exception of melacine vaccine  which has been approved for sale in canada  will ever be approved for commercial sale 
we will need additional capital and our ability to secure additional funding is uncertain 
we will continue to require substantial capital resources to conduct our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our discovery and research programs  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the magnitude and scope of our discovery  research and development programs  our ability to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in expanding and maintaining our manufacturing facilities  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors beyond our control 
we intend to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships  and also may seek additional funding through public or private equity financings  which could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  public or private debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our discovery  research  preclinical or clinical programs or manufacturing efforts 
we believe that our existing capital resources  committed payments under existing corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  bank credit arrangements  equity credit lines  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations over at least the next months 
however  a substantial number of the payments to be made by our corporate partners and other licensors depend on us achieving development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may significantly harm our future capital position 
our business will not succeed if our technology and products are rejected by the marketplace 
our technological approach to the development of immunotherapeutic products based on targeted antigens for autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases is unproven in humans 
with the exception of our melacine r vaccine  products based on our technologies are currently in the research  preclinical or clinical investigation stages 
currently  only a small number of our immunotherapeutic products have advanced to clinical trials 
only one of our corporate partners is conducting clinical trials that incorporate our proprietary microsphere delivery system 
other than an immunotherapeutic product incorporating mpl r adjuvant that has been approved for sale on a named patient basis in germany  and melacine  which includes the enhanzyn adjuvant  and is approved for sale in canada  neither we nor any of our corporate partners has commercialized any products that incorporate our proprietary adjuvants 
in addition  neither we nor any other company has successfully commercialized any therapeutic vaccines for cancer or the infectious or autoimmune diseases that we target 
we may be unable to develop effective vaccines for these diseases in a reasonable time frame  if ever  and the vaccines may not be capable of being commercialized 
most of our programs are currently in the discovery stage or in preclinical development 
currently  of our immunotherapeutic programs have advanced to clinical trials 
with the exception of melacine  which is available for sale in canada and which has completed phase iii clinical trials in canada and the united states  our vaccines have not completed clinical trials 
our programs may not move beyond their current stages of development 
even if approved for marketing  our or our corporate partners products may not be as effective as competing products or alternative treatment methods and may never achieve market acceptance 
physicians  patients or the medical community generally may not accept or utilize any products that may be developed by us or our corporate partners 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  our business will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth through acquisitions 
we will need to continue to grow to successfully complete our research and development efforts and plans for commercializing our products 
managing this growth will entail numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including inability to attract enough qualified personnel to staff any new or expanded operations  impairment of relationships with employees or corporate partners as we focus on different or additional projects  risks of entering new markets in which we have little or no prior experience  inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  disruption of our ongoing business  and diversion of our resources 
recently  as a result of our receipt of the fda complete review letter for bexxar tm  and the recognition of additional synergies in the workforce as a result of our acquisition of coulter  we modified our operating plan 
we will initiate immediate expense reductions  including a reduction in total headcount that includes the elimination of unfilled open positions  as well as existing positions 
these reductions in research and development and administrative support staff will result in the postponement of further internal development of certain programs 
additionally  we are attempting to outsource our sales and marketing personnel 
if we are unable to establish such agreements  we may be required to make additional headcount reductions 
if we do not successfully integrate our recent or potential future acquisitions  our business will suffer 
we have recently completed several acquisitions of complementary technologies  product candidates and businesses  including our acquisition of coulter  our largest acquisition to date 
in the future  we may acquire additional complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing these acquisitions has entailed and may in the future entail  both in connection with the coulter acquisition and other potential acquisitions  numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies  higher than expected acquisition and integration costs  which may adversely effect our quarterly and annual operating results  difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to integrating or completing the development or commercialization of any acquired technologies  impairment of relationships with key customers of acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership of the acquired businesses  inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses  and increased amortization expenses if an acquisition results in significant goodwill or other intangible assets 
if we do not successfully integrate coulter and any future acquisition  our business will suffer 
we expect to incur future operating losses 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each year since our inception on september  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  of which million is attributable to the write off of in process research and development costs associated with the acquisitions of coulter  ribi  anergen and genquest 
we may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
these losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with our acquisition activities  including the expenses associated with the write off of in process research and development  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
substantially all of our revenue and other income to date have resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
we may never achieve profitability  and our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations depends in large part on our entering into agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for our products  such as bexxar tm  and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
however  our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
our results of operations are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease 
payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  from which we receive substantially all of our revenue  are subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amounts 
as a result  our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
because of these fluctuations  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful 
in addition  our results of operations for a particular quarter or year may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could result in a decrease in our stock price 
if our corporate partnerships are not successful or if we are unable to find corporate partnerships in the future  our business may suffer 
the success of our business strategy largely depends on our ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may result from this strategy 
we derived  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and from research and development and other funding under our existing corporate partnerships 
we have established relationships with various corporate partners  including medicis  glaxosmithkline and several of its affiliates  the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco  zambon  zenyaku kogyo  schering corporation and schering plough  and organon  among others 
the process of establishing corporate partnerships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
our discussions with potential partners may not lead to the establishment of new corporate partnerships on favorable terms  if at all 
if we successfully establish new corporate partnerships  such partnerships may never result in the successful development of our products or the generation of significant revenue 
some of our corporate partners have options to license aspects of our technology 
any of these corporate partners may not exercise its option to license this technology 
we have also entered into corporate partnerships with several companies for the development  commercialization and sale of diagnostic products incorporating our proprietary antigen technology 
these diagnostic corporate partnerships may never generate significant revenue 
because we generally enter into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  our success largely depends on the performance of our corporate partners 
we do not directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by our corporate partners to collaborative activities 
as a result  our corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to our research and development programs or the commercialization of our products 
if any corporate partner fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  if at all  our preclinical or clinical development related to the corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
also  our current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
finally  our corporate partners may terminate any of our current partnerships  and we may be unable to negotiate additional corporate partnerships in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
management of our relationships with our corporate partners will require significant time and effort from our management team  coordination of our research with the research priorities of our corporate partners  effective allocation of our resources to multiple projects  and an ability to attract and retain key management  scientific and other personnel 
our inability to license technology from third parties or our inability to maintain exclusive licenses may impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
our success also depends on our ability to enter into licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to developing and commercializing our or our partners products 
we have various license agreements that provide us rights to use technologies owned or licensed by third parties 
these license agreements generally allow us and our corporate partners to use the licensed technology in research  development and commercialization activities 
additionally  many of our in licensing agreements contain milestone based termination provisions  in which case our failure or the failure of any of our corporate partners to meet any agreed milestones may allow the licensor to terminate an agreement 
we may be unable to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  our current license agreements may be terminated  and we may be unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
commercialization of monoclonal antibody based products may require licensing or cross licensing of one or more patents with other organizations in the field 
if we cannot obtain or maintain licenses to technologies advantageous or necessary to develop and commercialize our products  our corporate partners and we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
if we are unable to do so  we may be prevented from commercializing our products and our business may suffer 
if we are unable to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses our competitive position may be harmed and our business may suffer 
if we are unable to gain access to patent and proprietary rights or to protect and enforce our patents and proprietary rights  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patents  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary positions by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business 
as of december   we owned  licensed or had the option to license issued us patents that expire at various times between may and august  as well as pending us patent applications 
our patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving 
accordingly  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection  we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our corporate partners may not provide a competitive advantage  other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our corporate partners  patents issued to other companies may harm our ability to do business  disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us  our licensors  corporate partners and other scientific collaborators  other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies  and other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary know how and confidential data and continue to explore further methods of protection 
although we require all employees  consultants  partners and customers to enter into confidentiality agreements  we cannot be certain that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
any material leak of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could cause our business to suffer 
if third parties challenge the validity of our patents or proprietary rights  our business may suffer 
a substantial number of patents have issued  and an even larger number of patent applications have been filed  in the fields of immunology and molecular biology 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
however  our technologies may infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties 
this could result in our corporate partners and us being prevented from pursuing product development or commercialization of our technologies and product candidates 
this result would harm our business 
our registered trademarks  mpl r and melacine r  are currently the subjects of opposition proceedings before the office for the harmonization in the internal market  which handles initial prosecution and opposition of european trademarks 
it is uncertain whether we will ultimately prevail in these opposition proceedings 
as a result  we may not receive trademark protection for mpl and melacine in europe  in which case our business may suffer 
we have licensed several patent applications from southern research institute  or sri  related to our microsphere encapsulation technology 
two of these patent applications are currently the subject of opposition proceedings before the european patent office 
in one of the oppositions  the european patent office has revoked a previously issued european patent 
although sri has appealed this decision  it is uncertain whether sri will ultimately prevail in this or any other opposition proceeding 
as a result  these patents may not issue in europe  in which case our business may suffer 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights owned or used by us may be costly and time consuming  and may harm our business 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights  united states patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states and elsewhere involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  these proceedings are costly and time consuming  and their outcome is uncertain 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our issued and licensed patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
if we become involved in any litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing and commercializing our products  if any  in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
any of these outcomes could harm our business 
we depend heavily on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  the loss of whom could impair our ability to compete 
the loss of the services of any of the principal members of our management and scientific staff could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to our success 
we may be unable to attract and retain these individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  and the failure to do so would harm our business 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
we also have relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request or assist us in formulating our research  development or clinical strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and can generally expect these individuals to devote only limited amounts of time to our activities 
failure of any of these persons to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs could harm our business 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist the companies in developing technologies that may compete with our products 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise in discovery  research and development  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than us 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
many companies and institutions compete with us in developing alternative therapies to treat or prevent autoimmune diseases  cancer and infectious diseases  including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions  and research organizations 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  thereby preventing us from obtaining technology on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we or our corporate partners do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical development  obtaining regulatory approval and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring and developing technologies complementary to our programs 
we and our corporate partners will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  product price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us and our corporate partners 
these competitive products may achieve a greater market share or render our products obsolete 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
our current manufacturing facilities may not be sufficient to support our or our corporate partners needs for clinical quantities of our products or commercial quantities of our current adjuvant products 
we have limited experience producing commercial quantities of any product  or in producing clinical grade or commercial amounts of our proprietary antigen based products  including recombinant proteins or antibodies 
although we currently manufacture limited quantities of some antigens and several adjuvants  and are capable of clinical gmp manufacturing of both adjuvants and some finished vaccine products  we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce larger quantities of recombinant protein or other cell culture based biologicals for clinical trials and product commercialization 
these contract manufacturers and we may be unable to manufacture our proprietary antigen vaccines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers also may be unable to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these manufacturers  our preclinical and clinical testing would be delayed  thereby delaying submission of products for regulatory approval  or the market introduction and commercial sale of the products 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of those manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda approval of our products will not be granted 
we have no existing internal capacity or experience with respect to manufacturing radiolabeled antibody products for large scale clinical trials or commercial purposes 
we rely on bi pharma kg to produce anti b antibody 
we have entered into an agreement with bi pharma kg to produce bulk anti b antibody and fill the individual product vials with anti b antibody 
we have contracted with bi pharma kg and a third party supplier for labeling and packaging services 
these manufacturers have limited experience producing  labeling and packaging the anti b antibody  and we cannot assure you that they will be able to produce our requirements in commercial quantities or with acceptable quality 
we rely on nordion for radiolabeling the anti b antibody at nordion s centralized radiolabeling facility 
we have entered into an agreement with nordion for supply of the radiolabeled anti b antibody for both clinical trials and commercial sale 
given the eight day half life of the i radioisotope  nordion currently is producing radiolabeled anti b antibody in a clinical scale facility sufficient to support on going clinical trials 
nordion is transitioning the production of radiolabeled anti b antibody to a commercial scale facility prior to potential fda approval in support of potential product launch 
however  we cannot assure you that nordion will be able to successfully transition to the commercial scale facility and  if bexxar tm is approved and is successful in the market  we cannot assure you that nordion s capacity to radiolabel antibodies will be sufficient to meet all of our commercial requirements 
we are aware of only a limited number of manufacturers capable of producing the anti b antibody in commercial quantities or radiolabeling the antibody with the i radioisotope on a commercial scale 
to establish and qualify a new facility to centrally radiolabel antibodies could take three years or longer 
further  radiolabeled antibody cannot be stockpiled against future shortages due to the eight day half life of the i radioisotope 
accordingly  any change in our existing contractual relationships with  or interruption in supply from  our producer of unlabeled antibody or our radiolabeler would affect adversely our ability to complete our ongoing clinical trials and to market bexxar  if approved 
any change or interruption would harm our business 
although we are evaluating additional sources of supply for production and radiolabeling of the anti b antibody  we cannot assure you that these sources will be secured on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis  if at all 
nordion intends to change its source of i radioisotope from tellurium derived i to fission derived i 
we will need to obtain fda approval of the fission derived i radioisotope prior to using it in clinical trials or commercial supply 
although fission derived i radioisotope has been approved for human use in other applications  we cannot assure you that the fission derived i labeled anti b antibody will be suitable for human use  and that clinical trials or commercial supply will not be delayed or disrupted if we are unable to obtain fda approval for this product 
because we have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  our business may suffer 
as a result of the coulter acquisition  we have a sales and marketing force focused on bexxar tm sales and marketing in the united states 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage effectively these sales and marketing operations 
we intend to rely on our corporate partners to market our products outside the united states and  in the case of autoimmune and infectious disease products  worldwide 
our corporate partners may not have effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if we are unable to maintain or establish relationships and are required to market any of our products directly  we will need to build a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with third parties or build in house sales and distribution capabilities 
we have hired direct sales and marketing personnel in preparation for the market launch of bexxar  however  the ability to market bexxar  if approved  will be contingent upon recruiting  training and deploying the remainder of the necessary sales and marketing force as well as gsk s performance under the collaboration agreement 
developing an effective sales force will require significant financial resources and time 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish an effective sales force in a timely or cost effective manner  if at all  or that our sales force will be capable of generating demand for bexxar or other product candidates 
on march   we announced the receipt of a complete review letter from the fda and that because of the resulting delay in potential bexxar approval we are seeking to contract out the services of our sales and marketing personnel during the delay period 
if we are unable to contract out the services of our sales and marketing personnel in a timely manner we may be required to make additional headcount reductions 
our stock price could be very volatile and your shares may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility depending on numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  progress of our regulatory approvals  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies by us or our competitors  changes in our existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements by us or our competitors  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio  developments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports and recommendations regarding us or our competitors  changes in government regulations  economic and other external factors  additions or departures of any of our key personnel  operating losses by us  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock 
any claims relating to our improper handling  storage or disposal of hazardous materials could be time consuming  costly and may adversely affect our business 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed our resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
the manufacture and administration of bexxar tm requires the handling  use and disposal of i  a radioactive isotope of iodine 
these activities must comply with various state and federal regulations 
violations of these regulations could significantly delay completion of clinical trials and commercialization of bexxar 
for our ongoing clinical trials and for commercial scale production  we rely on nordion to radiolabel the anti b antibody with i at a single location in canada 
violations of safety regulations could occur with this manufacturer  and  therefore  there is a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
in the event of any regulatory noncompliance or accident  the supply of radiolabeled anti b antibody for use in clinical trials or commercially could be interrupted  which could harm our business 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that might have an adverse effect on the research  development  production and marketing of our products 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
our business may be harmed by the cost of compliance 
we face product liability exposure and potential unavailability of insurance 
we may experience losses due to product liability claims 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage 
our coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost  if at all 
we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing 
a product liability claim  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  may harm our business 
we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement and healthcare reform 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our or our corporate partners products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may also change before any of our corporate partners or our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we or any of our corporate partners may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
bexxar  as potentially the first radioimmunotherapy for cancer  faces particular uncertainties due to the absence of a comparable  approved therapy to serve as a model for pricing and reimbursement decisions 
further  if bexxar is not administered in most cases on an outpatient basis  as is contemplated currently by us  the projected cost of the therapy will be higher than we anticipate 
we or our corporate partners products  if any  may not be considered cost effective or adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us or our corporate partners to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investment 
our stockholders face immediate and potential dilution 
you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of your investment if we issue additional shares of our common stock under the terms of the september multi field collaboration and license agreement with gsk  we issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with entering into new corporate partnerships or acquiring additional technologies or companies  or we issue additional shares of our common stock as reimbursement of royalties prepaid by beckman coulter  inc to dana farber cancer institute  inc that beckman coulter  inc 
can elect to receive as stock 
state laws and provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit potential acquisition bids that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware and washington law  will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial for our stockholders 
at our annual meeting  we are asking our stockholders to approve a classified board provision 
this classified board provision will divide the board of directors into three classes with the directors terms ranging from one to three years 
beginning with our annual meeting  all future directors will serve from the time of election until the third annual meeting following election or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified 
should our stockholders approve of this classified board provision  it may combine with certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of corixa 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow our board to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to call a special meeting  specify restrictive procedures for director nominations by stockholders  specify that directors may be removed only with cause  and specify a supermajority requirement for stockholders to change the number of directors 
we are subject to certain provisions of delaware law  which could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in particular  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless specific conditions are met 
the proposed classified board provision  the possible issuance of preferred stock  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent  the lack of cumulative voting in the election of directors  the procedures required for director nominations  special stockholder meetings and changing the number of directors  the ability to remove directors only with cause  and delaware and washington law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
the provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
