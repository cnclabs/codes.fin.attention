market risk management the company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed by entering into hedging transactions authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities 
hedging transactions involve the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are used only where there is an underlying exposure not for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign operations the company has significant foreign operations  for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in swiss and french francs  german marks  italian lire  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
as the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company has operations increase or decrease relative to the us dollar  the sales  expenses  profits  assets and liabilities of the company s foreign operations  as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements  increase or decrease  accordingly 
the company mitigates a portion of the fluctuations in certain foreign currencies through the purchase of foreign currency swaps  forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments  primarily for purchases of inventory and other assets denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rates the company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
the company s primary exposure is to united states interest rates 
the company also periodically enters into interest rate swaps  caps or collars to hedge its exposure and lower financing costs 
commodities certain components used in the company s products are exposed to commodity price changes 
the company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
primary commodity price exposures are metals and packaging materials 
sensitivity to changes in value the estimates that follow are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value or earnings the company could lose in one year from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings that the company expects to incur 
the estimates do not consider favorable changes in market rates 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  any loss or gain in the fair value of derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations are foreign exchange forwards  currency swaps and fixed rate debt 
certain instruments are included in both categories of risk exposure calculated below 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one year loss in fair value and earnings before income taxes from a movement in foreign currencies and a basis point movement in interest rate market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at september  estimated impact on earnings before millions fair value income taxes foreign exchange rate instruments interest rate instruments other factors the company has not been significantly impacted by inflationary pressures over the last several years 
the company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials may impact future operating costs and  accordingly  the prices of its products 
the company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies 
price increases and  in certain situations  price decreases are implemented for individual products  when appropriate 
pending accounting changes in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
upon adoption of sfas  goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
other intangible assets will be required to be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
amortization of these intangibles over their useful lives is required 
the company has elected to adopt sfas as of the beginning of fiscal the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas and believes  excluding impairments  net income for fiscal year will be increased  since goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  by approximately million 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and provides additional implementation guidance for assets to be held and used and assets to be disposed of other than by sale

the company is required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal item a
