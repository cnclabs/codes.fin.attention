the metal products segment has been affected by an overall decline in domestic production of malleable iron castings and a parallel increase in the importation of foreign castings 
the decline in domestic production is expected to continue in castings imported from countries in asia  latin america and europe with weak currency exchange rates are creating pricing pressure and have eroded our contract casting business

the company expects that capital expenditures for will approximate the current year s depreciation expense of million 
the present financial strength of the company s balance sheet demonstrated by a current ratio of to  positive cash flow from operating activities and availability of a million credit line will enable the company to meet its current obligations and continue to grow in impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant  as the company has generally been able to adjust its prices to reflect higher manufacturing costs  or has been able to improve its manufacturing processes to achieve increased productivity 
historical data as presented in the financial statements reasonably relate current costs  except for depreciation  to revenues generated in the period 
depreciation expense based on the current replacement cost of plant and equipment would be higher than depreciation expense reported in historical financial statements 
the company uses the last in first out lifo method of accounting for its domestic inventories and the first in first out fifo method for all other inventories 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current cost and thus provides a closer matching of revenue and expenses in periods of increasing costs

its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales less than of total sales to non affiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to foreign markets  any currency exchange gains or losses are not material 
the interest rate paid by the company under its term loan agreement is closely linked to the us economy 
to minimize significant interest rate exposure  the company entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on a portion of its term debt 
the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause a  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
