overview we develop hardware and software technologies that enable users to interact with computers using their sense of touch 
we focus on four application areas computing and entertainment  medical simulation  professional and industrial  and three dimensional capture and interaction 
in high volume market areas such as consumer computer peripherals and automotive interfaces  we primarily license our touch enabling technologies to third party manufacturers 
we have licensed our intellectual property to numerous manufacturers of mice  joysticks and steering wheels targeted at consumers 
in addition  we are currently working on development projects with several automobile manufacturers and have licensed our technology to bmw for use in the controls of certain of its upcoming vehicles 
for lower volume markets like medical simulation systems and three dimensional capture and interaction products  our primary strategy is to manufacture and sell products through direct sales  distributors and value added resellers 
we sell medical simulation devices used to train professionals in a variety of procedures 
these devices simulate such procedures as intravenous catheterization  endovascular interventions and endoscopy 
we also sell three dimensional capture and interaction products 
these consist primarily of our line of computer digitizing products  including the microscribe d and the newly introduced lightscribe d  and specialized whole hand sensing gloves  such as the cyberglove  cybergrasp and cyberforce  that permit simulated interaction with three dimensional environments 
in all market areas  we engage in development projects for third parties 
we have entered into numerous contracts with government agencies and corporations since government contracts help fund advanced research and development  are typically less than two years in duration  are usually for a fixed price or for our costs plus a fixed fee  and allow the government agency to license the resulting technology for government applications  specifically excluding any commercial activity 
corporate contracts are typically for product development consulting  are for a fixed fee and are also less than two years in duration

development projects generally involve assisting our licensees in the development of their touch enabled products for which we receive fixed payments for product related deliverables or consulting services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with applicable accounting standards including american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended

the increase in product sales is mainly attributed to a million increase in sales of professional medical products  and a  increase in immersion processors sales with smaller increases and decreases in other product categories 
the decrease in contract revenue is mainly attributed to the conclusion of several long term contracts and the decision to shift focus from contract and research and development revenues to product sales and licensing

interest and other income 
interest and other income  consists primarily of interest income  dividend income and capital gains from cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest and other income was million in   in and  in the significant increase in interest and other income is due to the increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments chiefly from the million net proceeds of our public offering on november  the million increase in from represents the public offering proceeds less operating cash needs invested for twelve months in versus less than two months in interest and other expense 
interest and other expense  consists primarily of interest and warrant expense on long term debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

net proceeds from the initial public offering were million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million

we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for the full year ended december  will total approximately million in connection with anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
if the company acquires one or more businesses or products  the company s capital requirements could increase substantially 
in the event of such an acquisition or should any unanticipated circumstances arise which significantly increase the company s capital requirements  there can be no assurance that necessary additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of the company s portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the company s debt obligations 
the company s foreign operations are limited in scope and thus the company is not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations
