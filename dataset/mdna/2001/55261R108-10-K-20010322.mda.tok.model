marketing initiatives in resulted in a increase in consumer loans  primarily home equity loans  with balances totaling million at december  compared to million at december  
deposit account service charges increased to million for the year ended december  deposit account fee income continues to be one of the company s strongest revenue growth areas and is a result of successful initiatives to grow the bank s transaction account base

during  the company sold mortgage servicing rights relative to approximately million of mortgage loans at a pre tax profit of million  or 
per diluted share on an after tax basis 
historically  the bank has not been a seller of servicing rights and does not currently anticipate further bulk sales  but expects to continue to service most of the loans it originates for sale into the secondary market 
this bulk sale took advantage of aggressive pricing for loan servicing rights in the marketplace 
recent and anticipated future declines in the targeted federal funds rate are expected to result in a more favorable interest rate environment during although management still expects moderate pressure on the net interest margin during the first half of  it anticipates a higher trending net interest margin beginning in the second half of as a result of current federal reserve board monetary policy

management intends to review acquisition opportunities across a variety of parameters  including the potential impact on its financial condition as well as its financial performance in the future 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions  if any  will likely be valued at a premium to book value  and many times at a premium to current market value 
as such  management anticipates that acquisitions made by the company may include some book value per share dilution and earnings per share dilution for the company s shareholders depending on the company s success in integrating the operations of businesses acquired and the level of cost savings and revenue enhancements that may be achieved 
net interest income net interest income is the principal source of earnings for the company  and consists of interest income on loans receivable and mortgage backed and investment securities  offset by interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income fluctuates due to a variety of reasons  most notably due to the size of the balance sheet  changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent asset quality 
the company seeks to increase net interest income without materially mismatching maturities of the interest earning assets it invests in compared to the interest bearing liabilities that fund such investments 
net interest income before the provision for loan losses was million in  million in and million in the net interest margin net interest income divided by average interest earning assets for the same periods was   and  respectively 
during  the yield curve was primarily flat  to inverted with short term rates increasing throughout most of the year and long term year rates decreasing almost basis points 
this yield curve provided decreased net interest spread on asset growth in  which led to a basis point decline in the bank s net interest margin 
the rising short term rates and inverted yield curve  along with increased competition for retail deposits increased the cost of funding by basis points in as the yield curve moved more inverted throughout  mortgage customers continued to favor adjustable rate arm loans  most of which the bank kept in portfolio  despite tightening spreads to incremental funding costs 
not until the end of  when long term rates rallied quickly  did the bank begin to see a shift toward long term fixed rate mortgages 
the bank originated billion in loan volume in  down from billion in production in was adjustable  which helped the bank grow interest earning assets 
based on the decline in long term interest rates  the bank expects loan originations to favor fixed rate loans in  which will hamper its ability to grow earning assets in rate volume analysis the table below describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis during the periods indicated

during a period of declining interest rates  these loans prepay at a slower pace and help mitigate the risk of reinvesting prepayments into lower yielding assets as rates decrease 
management expects additional moderate pressure on the net interest margin during the first half of  with the net interest margin stabilizing and trending higher in the second half of offsetting the higher expected net interest margin is the prospect of slower asset growth due to the expected increase in fixed rate mortgage loans which the bank expects to sell

during the year ended december   the bank originated and purchased million in fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  of which million  or  conformed to the requirements for sale to fnma and fhlmc and million  or  did not conform to the requirements of these agencies 
during the year ended december   the bank sold million of these loans in the secondary market 
the bank s nonconforming loans are generally designated as such because the principal loan balance exceeds   as of january   which is the fhlmc and fnma purchase limit  and not because the loans present increased risk of default to the bank 
generally  nonconforming loans are held in the bank s loan portfolio 
loans with such excess balances generally carry interest rates from one eighth to three eighths of one percent higher than similar  conforming fixed rate loans

the bank s fixed rate loan products generally offer a monthly repayment option and some loans carry a prepayment penalty for the first five years of the loan 
interest rates charged on fixed rate loans are competitively priced on a daily basis based on secondary market prices and market conditions 
the bank generally originates its fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans in a form consistent with secondary market standards 
the bank offers a mortgage loan modification program that allows the borrower to receive a reduced interest rate  change in term  or a change in loan program  in lieu of refinancing the original loan 
the borrower is charged a fee that varies based upon the modifications made  including an appraisal fee when the bank requires a reappraisal of the collateral 
the program has been advantageous to the bank during periods of heavy refinance activity such as and anticipated in  by limiting the disruption to its loan operations  as well as reducing the costs associated with refinance activity of existing borrowers 
the bank s residential mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses giving the bank the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the bank has enforced due on sale clauses in its mortgage contracts for the purpose of increasing its loan portfolio yield  often through the authorization of assumptions of existing loans at higher rates of interest and the imposition of assumption fees 
arm loans may be assumed provided homebuyers meet the bank s underwriting standards and the applicable fees are paid 
loan applications are reviewed in accordance with the underwriting standards approved by the bank s board of directors and which generally conform to fnma standards 
loans in excess of million must be approved by the loan committee of the board of directors 
in underwriting residential real estate loans  the bank evaluates both the borrower s ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan 
potential borrowers are qualified for arm loans and fixed rate loans based on the initial or stated rate of the loan  except for one year arm loans with a loan to value ratio in excess of and a term greater than years  in which case the borrower is qualified at above the initial note rate 
upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower  credit reports are ordered and income  employment and financial information is verified in accordance with underwriting standards 
an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is undertaken by a bank appraiser or an independent appraiser previously approved by the bank 
it is the bank s policy to obtain title insurance on all mortgage loans 
borrowers also must obtain hazard including fire insurance prior to closing 
the bank requires flood insurance on a property located in special flood hazard areas 
borrowers are generally required to advance funds on a monthly basis together with each payment of principal and interest through a mortgage escrow account from which the bank makes disbursements for items such as real estate taxes and hazard insurance premiums as they become due 
the bank has adopted a policy of limiting the loan to value ratio on originated loans and refinanced loans to and requiring that loans exceeding of the appraised value of the property or its purchase price  whichever is less  generally be insured by a mortgage insurance company approved by the fnma in an amount sufficient to reduce the bank s exposure to no greater than the level 
the bank has originated approximately million in loans with loan to value ratios greater than where  based on certain underwriting criteria  it has charged a higher interest rate and not required or obtained private mortgage insurance 
despite the benefits of arm loans to the bank s asset liability management program  they do pose potential additional risks  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payment requirements of the borrower rise  thereby increasing the potential risk of default 
construction and land lending 
the bank originates loans to finance the construction of one to four family residences  primarily in its market area 
at december   the bank had million of loans to finance the construction of one to four family residences 
the bank also originates loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used primarily for residential purposes in cases where the bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties 
at december   the bank s construction and land loans totaled million  or  of total loans receivable 
the bank uses underwriting and construction loan guidelines for financing primarily individual  owner occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved 
construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase or to be paid off upon receiving financing from another financial institution 
construction loans are based on the appraised value of the property  as determined by an independent appraiser  and an analysis of the potential marketability and profitability of the project 
construction loans generally have terms of up to months  with extensions as needed 
loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant 
land loans include loans to developers for the development of residential subdivisions in the bank s market area 
at december   the bank had land loans to developers totaling million 
at december   the largest aggregate amount of land acquisition and development loans to a single developer amounted to million 
loans to developers are generally short term loans with terms of three to five years 
by policy  the loan to value ratio may not exceed and generally is less than 
the majority of such loans are based on the prime rate  or the london interbank offering rate libor 
loans generally are made to customers of the bank and developers with whom the bank has had long standing relationships 
the bank requires an independent appraisal of the property and feasibility studies may be required to determine the profit potential of the development project 
land loans are also made to local builders for the purchase of improved lots 
at december   the bank had land loans outstanding to local builders totaling million 
such loans are generally for terms of up to three years and are generally granted at rates similar to rates quoted for arm residential mortgage loans 
the loan to value ratio on such loans is limited to 
land loans for the purchase of fully improved lots are also made to individuals 
at december   the bank had land loans to individuals totaling million 
such loans are made for up to year terms with adjustable or fixed interest rates which are made at the prevailing rates for one to four family residential loans 
construction and land development loans afford the bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on arm loans secured by existing residential properties 
these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending 
construction and land development loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of the foregoing  construction and land development lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of  and accrued interest on  the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  the bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time 
the bank has attempted to address these risks through its underwriting procedures and its limited amount of construction lending on multi family and commercial real estate properties 
multi family lending 
the bank originates multi family residential mortgage loans in its market area 
at december   the bank had multi family loans of million  including a portfolio of purchased participating interests of million related to low income housing 
multi family loans represent of total loans receivable at december  arm loans represented of the multi family residential loan portfolio at december  such loans are offered with initial fixed rate periods of one  three  five  seven and ten years 
multi family residential mortgage loans are made for terms to maturity of up to years and carry a loan to value ratio not greater than 
the bank requires a positive net operating income to debt service ratio for loans secured by multi family residential property 
loans secured by properties of five or more units are qualified on the basis of rental income generated by the property 
commercial real estate lending 
in connection with the bank s policy of maintaining an interest rate sensitive loan portfolio  the bank has originated loans secured by commercial real estate  which generally carry a higher yield and are made for a shorter term than fixed rate one to four family residential loans 
at december   the bank had million of commercial real estate loans 
the bank s policy has been to originate additional commercial real estate loans on a limited basis 
commercial real estate loans are generally granted in amounts up to of the appraised value of the property  as determined by an independent appraiser previously approved by the bank 
the bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by improved properties located in the chicago metropolitan area 
the bank often requires borrowers to provide their personal guarantees on loans made for commercial real estate 
loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
the bank seeks to minimize these risks by lending primarily on existing income producing properties and generally restricting such loans to properties in the chicago area 
the bank analyzes the financial condition of the borrower and the reliability and predictability of the net income generated by the security property in determining whether to extend credit 
in addition  the bank generally requires a net operating income to debt service ratio of at least times 
a loan with an outstanding balance of million at december   represents the bank s largest single commercial real estate loan to one borrower 
the loan is on a shopping center located in carol stream  illinois and is current as to the payment of principal and interest at december  at december   the bank s ten largest commercial real estate loans totaled million  all of which are current and performing in accordance with their original terms 
other lending 
the bank s other lending activities consist of consumer lending  primarily home equity loans  fixed rate second mortgage loans  and to a lesser extent  commercial business lending 
on december   outstanding balances on home equity lines represented million or of the bank s total loan portfolio 
home equity lines of credit are generally extended up to of the appraised value of the property  less existing liens  generally at interest rates which range from the designated prime rate minus 
to plus  based on balances drawn 
to a lesser extent  the bank offers home equity lines of credit at greater than of the appraised value of the property 
the interest rate on loan to value lines of credit is the designated prime rate plus to 
the bank uses the same underwriting standards for home equity lines of credit as it uses for residential mortgage loans 
other home equity loans consist of million of primarily fixed rate second mortgage loans that generally amortize over a three to ten year period 
environmental issues 
the bank encounters certain environmental risks in its lending activities 
under federal and state environmental laws  lenders may become liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous materials found on security property 
although environmental risks are usually associated with industrial and commercial loans  risks may be substantial for residential lenders like the bank if environmental contamination makes the security property unsuitable for use 
this could also have an effect on nearby property values 
in accordance with fnma and fhlmc guidelines  appraisals for single family residences on which the bank lends include comments on environmental influences 
the bank attempts to control its risk by training its appraisers and underwriters to be cognizant of signs indicative of environmental hazards 
no assurance can be given  however  that the values of properties securing loans in the bank s portfolio will not be adversely affected by unforeseen environmental risks  although the bank is unaware of any environmental issues which would subject it to liability at this time 
originations  purchases  sales  swaps of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the bank originates and purchases both arm and fixed rate loans 
its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for fixed rate or arm loans in the origination and purchase market  which is affected by the term structure short term compared to long term of interest rates as well as the current and expected future level of interest rates 
the bank sells selected conforming fixed rate and arm mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
substantially all of these loans are sold without recourse 
these loan sales also allow the bank to continue to make loans when deposit flows decline or funds are not otherwise available for lending 
generally  the loans are sold for cash or securitized and sold in the secondary mortgage market to investors such as fnma and fhlmc  as well as investment banks and other financial institutions 
the bank has also exchanged or swapped loans out of its portfolio for mortgage backed securities primarily with fnma and fhlmc 
generally  the mortgage backed securities are used to collateralize borrowings and deposits or are sold in the secondary market to raise additional funds 
swap activity by the bank is governed by pricing levels in the secondary mortgage market for whole mortgage loans versus securitized mortgage loans  as well as the level of rates for collateralized borrowings 
during the current year  the bank swapped and sold million  compared to million for the year ended december  all of the mortgage backed securities and cmos in the bank s portfolio are issued by or have collateral backed by fnma  fhlmc or gnma  or are backed with whole loan collateral and have an investment grade rating 
coupon rates at december   ranged from to

the bank will send a late notice  and in most cases  delinquencies are cured promptly  however  if a loan has been delinquent for more than days  the bank contacts the borrower in order to determine the reason for the delinquency and to effect a cure  and  where appropriate  reviews the condition of the property and the financial circumstances of the borrower 
based upon the results of any such investigation  the bank may accept a repayment program for the arrearage from the borrower  seek evidence  in the form of a listing contract  of efforts by the borrower to sell the property if the borrower has stated that he is attempting to sell  request a deed in lieu of foreclosure  or initiate foreclosure proceedings 
when a loan payment is delinquent for three or more monthly installments  the bank will initiate foreclosure proceedings 
interest income on loans is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest on loans that are in process of foreclosure or otherwise determined to be uncollectible

non performing loans 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
for loans that are not individually significant ie loans under million  and represent a homogeneous population  the bank evaluates impairment collectively based on management reports on the level and extent of delinquencies  as well as historical loss experience for these types of loans 
the bank uses these criteria on one to four family residential loans  consumer loans  multi family residential loans  and land loans 
impairment for loans considered individually significant and commercial real estate loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
charge offs of principal occur when a loss has occurred as a result of the book value exceeding the fair value 
a loan whether considered impaired or not is classified as non accrual when collectibility is in doubt  and is normally analyzed upon the borrower becoming days past due on contractual principal or interest payments 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  or in the process of foreclosure  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
income is subsequently recorded to the extent cash payments are received  or at a time when the loan is brought current in accordance with its original terms

for the year ended december   interest income on non accrual loans that was recorded amounted to  classified assets 
the federal regulators have adopted a classification system for problem assets of insured institutions that covers all problem assets 
under this classification system  problem assets of insured institutions are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such an amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the institution s principal supervisory agent of the ots  who can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
in connection with the filing of its periodic reports with the ots  the bank regularly reviews the problem loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
at december  and  all of the bank s non performing loans were classified as substandard 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activity 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans of which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance

the following table sets forth the company s allocation of its allowance for loan losses 
this allocation is based on management s subjective estimates 
the amount allocated to a particular category should not be interpreted as the only amount available for future charge offs that may occur within that category it may not be indicative of future charge off trends and it may change from year to year based on management s assessment of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio

consumer   unallocated portion  na  na  na total    at december   the bank s loan portfolio consisted of of one to four family real estate loans  with an additional being equity lines of credit or home equity loans on one to four family real estate and other consumer loans 
based on the bank s historically high asset quality  low charge off experience and concentration on one to four family lending in its market area  management considers the risk of loss due to these loans as minimal 
the remaining of the bank s portfolio  or million  consists of multi family mortgage  commercial real estate  construction  land  and other loans 
these loans generally tend to exhibit greater risk of loss than do one to four family loans  primarily because such loans typically carry higher loan balances and repayment is dependent  in large part  on sufficient income to cover operating expenses 
in addition  economic events and government regulations  which are outside the control of the bank and the borrower  could impact the security of the loan or the future cash flow of affected properties 
management has addressed these risks through its underwriting standards 
with respect to multi family loans  the bank has traditionally limited its lending to small apartment buildings less than units which management believes have lower risk than larger properties 
at december   in the bank s million multi family portfolio  loans are on properties greater than units and the average multi family loan size is  in addition  almost all of the bank s construction and land loans are on one to four family residential properties 
all of the bank s multi family  construction and land loans are secured by properties located in the chicago metropolitan area

although deposits are the bank s primary source of funds  the bank s policy has been to utilize borrowings  such as advances from fhlb of chicago  and reverse repurchase agreements  when they are a less costly source of funds or can be reinvested at a positive rate of return 
a summary of the company s borrowed funds at december  and is as follows december  december  weighted weighted interest rate average average range rate amount rate amount dollars in thousands fixed rate advances from fhlb due within year   to years   to years   to years   to years   to years   to years  greater than years   total fixed rate advances   adjustable rate advances from fhlb due within year  to years   to years  greater than years   total adjustable rate advances   total advances from fhlb   fixed rate reverse repurchase agreements  unsecured term bank loan   other borrowing   total borrowed funds   federal home loan bank of chicago advances the bank obtains advances from the fhlb of chicago upon the security of its capital stock in the fhlb of chicago and a blanket pledge of certain of its mortgage loans 
see regulation and supervision federal home loan bank system 
such advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the maximum amount that the fhlb of chicago will advance to member institutions  including the bank  for purposes other than meeting withdrawals  fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb of chicago 
the maximum amount of fhlb of chicago advances to a member institution generally is reduced by secured borrowings from any other source 
at december   the bank s fhlb of chicago advances totaled billion  representing of total assets

the bank receives a lower cost of borrowing on such advances than on similar non callable long term advances in return for granting the fhlb of chicago the right to call the advances prior to their final maturity 
if called  the fhlb of chicago will provide replacement funding at the then prevailing market rate of interest for the remaining term to maturity of the advances  subject to standard terms and conditions 
unsecured term bank loan the company obtained a million unsecured term bank loan in conjunction with its acquisition of northwestern 
the loan provides for an interest rate of the prime rate minus or over one  two  three  six  or twelve month libor at management s discretion adjustable and payable at the end of the repricing period

in conjunction with the term bank loan  the company also maintains a million one year unsecured revolving line of credit that matures annually on may the interest rate on the line of credit is the prime rate minus or over one  two  three  six or twelve month libor  at management s discretion with interest payable at the end of the repricing period 
at december   million is outstanding on the line of credit  at one month libor plus 
the financing agreements contain covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum stockholders equity balance and to obtain certain minimum operating results  as well as requiring the bank to maintain well capitalized regulatory capital levels and certain non performing asset ratios 
in addition  the company has agreed not to pledge any stock of the bank or maf developments for any purpose 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal assets are its investment in the bank and in maf developments 
to the extent that it does not generate significant earnings outside of these two subsidiaries  the company s liquidity position is primarily dependent on dividends from the bank and to a lesser extent dividends from maf developments 
the bank s ability to pay dividends to the company is dependent on its ability to generate earnings  and to meet regulatory restrictions 
see regulation and supervision limitation on capital distributions for a detail of these restrictions 
the bank has not been restricted by these limitations in funding the necessary amounts needed by the company for its operations 
the company received million in dividends from the bank in  compared to million in  and million in the primary uses of funds at the company consist of principal and interest payments on borrowed funds  cash dividends  and stock repurchases 
the company has also funded loans to and investments in maf developments from time to time  although none were made in to the extent the company has excess cash at any time  it will invest funds in investment securities  marketable equity securities or other interest earning assets

the terms of these private transactions were approved by the disinterested members of the board 
the sale of shares was related to mr 
koranda s marital dissolution agreement 
the company has used stock repurchase programs as a means of providing for future acquisitions  stock option exercises  and other general corporate purposes 
cash dividends paid to common shareholders totaled million 
per share declared in  compared to million 
per share declared in the increase is primarily due to a increase in the cash dividend rate in compared to the most recent quarterly dividend of 
per share was paid on january  the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and depends on a variety of factors  including operating results  financial position  and the ability for the bank to pay dividends 
the bank s principal sources of funds are deposits  advances from the fhlb of chicago  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from the sale of loans and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan and mortgage backed securities amortization and maturing interest bearing deposits are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  the general level of interest rates and competition 
the bank utilizes particular sources of funds based on comparative costs and availability 
cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income for the year  adjusted for items in net income that did not impact cash  as well as cash flow activity from mortgage banking activity 
the bank originated and purchased million of loans for sale  and received million in proceeds from sales and swaps during the bank had million of loans held for sale at december   up from million at december  the increase in loans held for sale is due to declining interest rates that have led to an increase in fixed rate loan originations 
cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of loans and investments acquired for the bank s interest earning asset portfolios  as well as cash flows from asset sales  real estate held for development activity and the impact of business acquisitions 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  compared to million in during the current year  the bank originated and purchased billion of loans for investment  which were offset by million of loan amortization and prepayments 
additionally  the bank collected million in amortization and prepayments from mortgage backed securities  which were primarily reinvested into loans held for investment purposes 
purchases of investment securities declined in compared to as a higher portion of available funds were used to fund continued strong loan demand 
investments securities purchased by the company totaled million  financed mainly by maturities and sales of investments of million 
cash flow from the company s land development operations was positive  as sales of property of million was offset by expenditures for land acquisition and development of million 
cash provided from financing activities for bank operations are primarily in the form of savings deposits  fhlb of chicago advances and to a lesser extent  reverse repurchase agreements 
cash provided from financing activities totaled million in during the current year  as a means to fund loan originations held for investment  the bank borrowed a total of million of fhlb of chicago advances  which were offset by million of maturities 
at december   the company believes it has sufficient cash to fund its outstanding commitments  or will be able to obtain the necessary funds from outside sources to meet its cash needs 
the bank is required by regulation to maintain specific minimum levels of liquid investments 
regulations currently require the bank to maintain liquid assets at least equal to of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts and borrowed funds due in one year or less 
this regulatory requirement may be changed from time to time to reflect current economic conditions 
during the year ended december   the bank s average liquidity ratio was 
at december   total liquidity was million  or  which was million in excess of the regulatory requirement 
this excess liquidity has provided the bank with the flexibility needed to maintain its short term gap ratios within strategic limits  as well as most recently  to fund the increased loan volume 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated information are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

regulation and supervision general the company  as a savings and loan holding company  is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the ots under the home owners loan act the hola 
in addition  the activities of savings institutions  such as the bank  are governed by the hola and the federal deposit insurance act fdi act 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the ots  as its primary federal regulator  and the fdic  as the deposit insurer 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the savings association insurance fund saif managed by the fdic 
the bank must file reports with the ots and the fdic concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other savings institutions 
the ots and or the fdic conduct periodic examinations to test the bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such regulatory requirements and policies  whether by the ots  the fdic or the congress  could have a material adverse impact on the company  the bank and their operations 
certain of the regulatory requirements applicable to the bank and to the company are referred to below or elsewhere herein 
the description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this form k does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank and the company 
holding company regulation the company is a nondiversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the hola 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  the company generally will not be restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage  provided that the bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender qtl 
see federal savings institution regulation qtl test 
upon any non supervisory acquisition by the company of another savings institution or savings bank that meets the qtl test and is deemed to be a savings institution by the ots  the company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company if the acquired institution is held as a separate subsidiary and would be subject to extensive limitations on the types of business activities in which it could engage 
the hola limits the activities of a multiple savings and loan holding company and its non insured institution subsidiaries primarily to activities permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bank holding company act of  as amended bhc act  subject to the prior approval of the ots  and activities authorized by ots regulation and no multiple savings and loan holding company may acquire more than of the voting stock of a company engaged in impermissible activities 
the hola prohibits a savings and loan holding company  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring more than of the voting stock of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the ots  or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the fdic 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions  the ots must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition of the institution on the risk to the insurance funds  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
although savings and loan holding companies are not subject to specific capital requirements or specific restrictions on the payment of dividends or other capital distributions  hola does prescribe such restrictions on subsidiary savings institutions  as described below 
the bank must notify the ots days before declaring any dividend to the company 
in addition  the financial impact of a holding company on its subsidiary institution is a matter that is evaluated by the ots and the agency has authority to order cessation of activities or divestiture of subsidiaries deemed to pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the institution 
federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital standards a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio and an risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish  in effect  a minimum tangible capital standard  a leverage core capital ratio for institutions receiving the highest rating on the camel financial institution rating system  and  together with the risk based capital standard itself  a tier i risk based capital standard 
the ots regulations also require that  in meeting the leverage ratio  tangible and risk based capital standards  institutions must generally deduct investments in and loans to subsidiaries engaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for a national bank 
for the bank  this includes its million investment in nw financial at december   which the bank must deduct from regulatory capital for purposes of calculating its capital requirements 
the risk based capital standard for savings institutions requires the maintenance of tier i core and total capital which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital to risk weighted assets of at least and  respectively 
at december  and  the bank was in compliance with the current capital requirements as follows december  december  percent of percent of amount assets amount assets dollars in thousands stockholder s equity of the bank   tangible capital   tangible capital requirement   excess   core capital   core capital requirement   excess   core and supplementary capital   risk based capital requirement   excess   total bank assets   adjusted total bank assets   total risk weighted assets   adjusted total risk weighted assets   investment in bank s real estate subsidiaries   goodwill and core deposit intangibles   the following table reflects the bank s regulatory capital as of december  as it relates to these three capital requirements risk tangible core based dollars in thousands stockholder s equity of the bank    goodwill and core deposit intangibles    non permissible subsidiary deduction    non includible purchased mortgage servicing rights regulatory capital adjustment for available for sale securities low level recourse  general allowance for loan losses  regulatory capital    prompt corrective regulatory action 
under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  the severity of which depends upon the institution s degree of undercapitalization 
generally  a savings institution is considered well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
a savings institution generally is considered adequately capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  and its ratio of core capital to total assets is at least if the institution receives the highest camel rating 
a savings institution that has a ratio of total capital to weighted assets of less than  a ratio of tier i core capital to risk weighted assets of less than or a ratio of core capital to total assets of less than or less for institutions with the highest examination rating is considered to be undercapitalized 
a savings institution that has a total risk based capital ratio less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio that is less than is considered to be significantly undercapitalized  and a savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution  including  but not limited to  increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth  capital distributions and expansion 
the ots could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions  including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
insurance of deposit accounts 
the fdic has adopted a risk based deposit insurance system that assesses deposit insurance premiums according to the level of risk involved in an institution s activities 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized and one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based on a supervisory evaluation and information which the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance fund 
based on its capital and supervisory subgroups  each bank insurance fund bif and saif member institution is assigned an annual fdic assessment rate  with an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and healthy receiving the lowest rates and an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and posing substantial supervisory concern receiving the highest rates 
the fdic has authority to further raise premiums if deemed necessary 
if such action is taken  it could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the bank 
the deposit insurance funds act of the funds act imposed a special one time assessment on saif members  including the bank  to recapitalize the saif 
the saif was undercapitalized due primarily to a statutory requirement that saif members make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation fico to recapitalize the predecessor to saif 
the funds act spreads the obligations for payment of the fico bonds across all saif and bif members 
beginning on january   bif deposits were assessed for a fico payment of basis points  while saif deposits paid basis points 
full pro rata sharing of the fico payments between bif and saif members will occur on the date the bif and saif are merged 
as of december   the bif and saif have not been merged 
as a result of the funds act and the fdic act  the fdic voted to effectively lower saif assessments to to basis points as of january  the bank s assessment rate for the year ended december  was the lowest available to well capitalized financial institutions 
a significant increase in saif insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
under the fdi act  insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic or the ots 
the management of the bank does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
impact of the gramm leach bliley act 
on november   president clinton signed into law the gramm leach bliley act the glb act 
the glb act significantly reforms various aspects of the financial services business  including  but not limited to i the establishment of a new framework under which bank holding companies and  subject to numerous restrictions  banks can own securities firms  insurance companies and other financial companies  ii subjecting banks to the same securities regulation as other providers of securities products  and iii prohibiting new unitary savings and loan holding companies from engaging in nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities 
the provisions in the glb act permitting full affiliations between bank holding companies or banks and other financial companies do not increase our authority to affiliate with securities firms  insurance companies or other financial companies 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  the company was generally permitted to have such affiliations prior to the enactment of the glb act 
it is expected  however  that these provisions will benefit the company s competitors 
the prohibition on the ability of new unitary savings and loan holding companies to engage in nonfinancial activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities generally applies only to savings and loan holding companies that were not  or had not submitted an application to become  savings and loan holding companies as of may  since the company was treated as a unitary savings and loan holding company prior to that date  the glb act will not prohibit us from engaging in nonfinancial activities or acquiring nonfinancial subsidiaries 
however  the glb act generally restricts any nonfinancial entity from acquiring the company unless such nonfinancial entity was  or had submitted an application to become a savings and loan holding company as of may  the glb act imposes new requirements on financial institutions with respect to customer privacy by generally prohibiting disclosure of customer information to non affiliated third parties unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure 
financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually 
final regulations have been passed regarding customer privacy under the glb act  however  compliance with such privacy regulations are voluntary until july  the company does not believe that the glb act will have a material adverse affect upon its operations in the near term 
however  to the extent the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than the company currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets the company currently serves 
loans to one borrower 
under the hola  savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks 
generally  savings institutions may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of its unimpaired capital and surplus 
an additional amount may be lent  equal to of unimpaired capital and surplus  if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral  which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion 
at december   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower was million 
at december   the bank s largest aggregate outstanding balance of loans to any one borrower was million 
qtl test 
the hola requires savings institutions to meet a qtl test 
under the qtl test  a savings and loan association is required to either qualify as a domestic building and loan association under the internal revenue code or maintain at least of its portfolio assets total assets less i specified liquid assets up to of total assets  ii intangibles  including goodwill  and iii the value of property used to conduct business in certain qualified thrift investments primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage backed securities in at least months out of each month period 
a savings institution that fails the qtl test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter 
as of december   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and  therefore  met the qtl test 
limitation on capital distributions 
ots regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings institutions  such as cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
the regulations provide that an institution i which is not eligible for expedited treatment  or ii which its total amount of capital distributions for a calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus its retained income for the proceeding two years  or iii which would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  or iv which would violate a prohibition contained in a statute  regulation or agreement between the institution and the ots by performing the capital distribution  must submit an application to the ots to receive approval of the capital distribution 
under any other circumstances  the bank would be required to provide a written notice to the ots days prior to the capital distribution 
assessments 
savings institutions are required to pay assessments to the ots to fund the agency s operations 
the general assessment  paid on a semi annual basis  is computed upon the savings institution s total assets  including consolidated subsidiaries  as reported in the bank s latest quarterly thrift financial report 
the assessments paid by the bank were   and  in  and respectively 
branching 
ots regulations permit nationwide branching by federally chartered savings institutions to the extent allowed by federal statute 
this permits federal savings institutions to establish interstate networks and to geographically diversify their loan portfolios and lines of business 
the ots authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings institutions 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates eg  any company that controls or is under common control with an institution  including the company and its non savings institution subsidiaries is limited by sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra 
section a limits the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to of the capital and surplus of the savings institution 
the aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to of the savings institution s capital and surplus 
certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in section a  and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited 
section b generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates  including loans and asset purchases  must be on terms and under circumstances  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
in addition  savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary 
the bank s authority to extend credit to executive officers  directors and shareholders  as well as entities such persons control  is governed by sections g and h of the fra and regulation o thereunder 
among other things  such loans are generally required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and to not involve more than the normal risk of repayment 
regulation o also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans the bank may make to such persons based  in part  on the bank s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed 
enforcement 
under the fdi act  the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution affiliated parties  including stockholders  and any attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and or directors to institution of proceedings for receivership  conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance 
civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and may amount to as much as million per day in certain circumstances 
under the fdi act  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations 
standards for safety and soundness 
the federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines and a final rule to implement safety and soundness standards required under the fdi act 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
the standards set forth in the guidelines address internal controls and information systems  internal audit system  credit underwriting  loan documentation  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines  the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard  as required by the fdi act 
the final rule establishes deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans when such plans are required 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the fhlb system  which consists of regional fhlbs 
the fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb of chicago  is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that fhlb in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb chicago  whichever is greater 
at december   the bank was in compliance with this requirement  with an investment in fhlb of chicago stock of million 
fhlb of chicago advances must be secured by specified types of collateral and may be obtained primarily for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
the fhlbs are required to provide funds to cover certain obligations on bonds issued to fund the resolution of insolvent thrifts and to contribute funds for affordable housing programs 
these requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the fhlbs pay to their members and could also result in the fhlbs imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members 
for the years ended december    and  dividends from the fhlb of chicago to the bank amounted to million  million  and million  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and gap analysis 
as part of its normal operations  the bank is subject to interest rate risk on the interest sensitive assets it invests in and the interest sensitive liabilities it borrows 
the bank s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the bank s asset liability management committee alco and the board of directors of the company 
the alco  which includes members of senior management  monitors the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the individual asset and liability portfolios the bank maintains and determines risk management strategies 
the bank utilizes an interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to monitor the relationship of maturing or repricing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific period of time and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time  and is usually analyzed at a period of one year 
generally  a negative gap  where more interest bearing liabilities are repricing or maturing than interest earning assets  would tend to result in a reduction in net interest income in a period of rising interest rates 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would likely result in an improvement in net interest income 
management s goal is to maintain its cumulative one year gap within the range of to 
the gap ratio fluctuates as a result of market conditions and management s expectation of future interest rate trends 
the bank s asset liability management strategy emphasizes the origination of one to four family adjustable rate loans and other loans which have shorter terms to maturity or reprice more frequently than fixed rate mortgage loans  yet provide a positive margin over the bank s cost of funds  for its own portfolio 
historically  the bank has generally sold its conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market in order to maintain its interest rate sensitivity levels 
during the eighteen to twenty four month period ended june   the bank had been retaining the majority of the non conforming  fixed rate originations and all of the prepayment protected fixed rate loan originations in portfolio for investment purposes to help utilize the bank s higher capital base resulting from the merger with northwestern 
these fixed rate loans were funded with intermediate to longer term fixed rate fhlb advances  some of which contained call options at the discretion of the fhlb of chicago 
the bank  except as noted below  has not used derivative financial instruments such as swaps  caps  floors  options or similar financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
however  in conjunction with its origination and sale strategy discussed above  management does hedge the bank s exposure to interest rate risk primarily by committing to sell fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery 
under these commitments  the bank agrees to sell fixed rate loans at a specified price and at a specified future date 
the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans for future delivery has enabled the bank to continue to originate new mortgage loans  and to generate gains on sale of these loans as well as loan servicing fee income  while maintaining its gap ratio within the parameters discussed above 
most of these forward sale commitments are conducted with fnma and fhlmc with respect to loans that conform to the requirements of these government agencies 
the forward commitment of mortgage loans presents a risk to the bank if the bank is not able to deliver the mortgage loans by the commitment expiration date 
if this should occur  the bank would be required to pay a fee to the buyer 
the bank attempts to mitigate this risk by charging potential retail borrowers a fee to fix the interest rate  or by requiring the interest rate to float at market rates until shortly before closing 
in its wholesale lending operation  there is more risk due to the competitive inability to charge a rate lock fee to the mortgage brokers  which the bank tries to offset by using higher assumed fallout rates 
in addition  the bank uses us treasury bond futures contracts to hedge some of the mortgage pipeline exposure 
these futures contracts are used to hedge mortgage loan production in those circumstances where loans are not sold forward as described above 
the table on the next page sets forth the scheduled repricing or maturity of the bank s assets and liabilities at december  the table uses management s assumptions regarding prepayment percentages on loans and mortgage backed securities  based on its current experience in these portfolios 
the bank uses the withdrawal assumptions used by the fhlb of chicago with respect to now  checking and passbook accounts  which are annual rates of     and  respectively 
investment securities and fhlb advances that contain call provisions at the option of the issuer or lender are generally shown in the category relating to their respective final maturities 
million of fhlb advances with final maturities in more than five years  but callable in calendar are categorized as million due in months or less  in anticipation of them being called 
the effect of these assumptions is to quantify the dollar amount of items that are interest sensitive and may be repriced within each of the periods specified 
certain shortcomings are inherent in using gap analysis to quantify exposure to interest rate risk 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricings in the table  they may react differently to actual changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
this is especially true in circumstances where management has a certain amount of control over interest rates  such as the pricing of deposits 
additionally  certain assets such as hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
finally  as interest rates change  loan prepayment rates will differ from those rates assumed by management in the table 
although management believes that its asset liability management strategies mitigate the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the bank s operations  material and prolonged increases in interest rates may adversely affect the bank s operations because the bank s interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice within one year are currently greater than the bank s interest earning assets which mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  decreases in interest rates could benefit the bank s operation as maturing interest bearing liabilities are replaced at lower costs

the bank s cumulative one year gap was a negative million or  of total assets at december   compared with a negative million or of total assets at december  during  the bank took steps to decrease its liability sensitive gap measure by emphasizing the addition of shorter term liquidity investments  as well as extending maturities on borrowings and maturing certificates of deposit 
in addition  with the decline in interest rates during the last quarter of  prepayments on loans receivable increased  shortening expected maturities on longer term fixed rate loans  which helped further improve the negative gap position of the bank 
net portfolio value analysis 
under ots thrift bulletin a  the bank is required to measure its interest rate risk assuming various increases and decreases in general interest rates  and the effect on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
the board of directors has established limits to changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income across a range of hypothetical interest rate changes 
if estimated changes to npv and net interest income are not within these limits  the board may direct management to adjust its asset liability mix to bring its interest rate risk within board limits 
at december   the bank was within the board approval limits 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the bank s interest rate risk by calculating the estimated change in the npv of its cash flows from interest sensitive assets and liabilities  as well as certain off balance sheet items  in the event of a series of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates ranging from to basis points 
management assumes that a basis point movement up or down is considered reasonable and plausible for purposes of reviewing its overall interest rate risk 
npv is the market value of portfolio equity and is computed as the difference between the market value of assets and the market value of liabilities  adjusted for the value of off balance sheet items 
the table below shows the change in npv applying various rate shocks to the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  and estimated increase percentage increase change in estimated npv decrease in npv decrease in npv interest rate dollars in thousands basis point rise     basis point rise     base scenario   basis point decline     basis point decline     the bank s net portfolio value npv at december  increased million to million from million at december  the increase is due to a million increase in stockholders equity  the emphasis on adding adjustable rate mortgage loans to the bank s loan portfolio during  the extending of certificate of deposit maturities  and the decrease in market interest rates 
in addition  the sensitivity to changes in interest rates improved as noted by the bank s percentage change in npv at the basis point rise scenario 
this improvement is due to the addition of shorter duration loans receivable  which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates than longer term loans  as well as the addition of shorter term investment securities for the same reasons 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the bank 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities and operations
