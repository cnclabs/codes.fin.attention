item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition financial overview our revenues are generated from the sale of products in two principal product categories spinal implant products and orthobiologic products 
our spinal implant products consist of titanium or stainless steel hooks  rods  plates  spacers and screws and related instruments required for the surgeon to assemble a construct which restores the natural anatomy of the spine  keeping it immobilized while a bone graft eventually fuses the vertebrae 
our orthobiologic products consist of synthetic bone graft substitute materials and products used to derive agf 
agf is used to provide faster  more complete bone growth and enhance the performance of our bone graft products 
in may  we merged with cross medical products  inc  combining our orthobiologics expertise and product offering with cross spinal implant expertise and products 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and all financial information related to periods prior to the merger was restated to reflect the financial information of both companies as if we had always been a combined entity 
all of our operations are located in the united states  however  we sell our products to customers both within and outside the united states 
in  our domestic sales were of total sales and our international sales were of total sales 
within the united states  we distribute our products primarily through independent agents 
these independent agents provide a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and receive commissions based on sales in their territories 
the commissions are reflected in our income statement within selling and marketing expense 
for our spinal implant products  we invoice hospitals directly following a surgical procedure in which our products are used 
our spinal implant products are made available to hospitals from consignment inventories maintained by our larger independent agents  or from loaner implant sets that we ship from our facility 
for our orthobiologic products  we generally ship directly to hospitals from our facility  and we invoice hospitals upon shipment 
outside the united states  we sell our products directly to distributors who maintain an inventory of our products 
we record revenue at the time of shipment to the distributor at prices generally ranging from to of our us list prices 
the distributors service the surgeons and hospitals  deliver products and invoice hospitals directly at prices determined by the distributors 
because our revenues from us hospitals are primarily at list price  and our revenues from international distributors are at a discount to us list prices  our overall gross margin is subject to fluctuation based on our domestic versus international sales mix  with domestic gross margins being somewhat higher than international gross margins 
additionally  the mix between spinal implant sales and orthobiologic sales also affects our gross margins  with higher margins in orthobiologics

sales of orthobiologic products increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  agf related products  which were launched on a nationwide basis during the second quarter of  increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in sales of synthetic bone products decreased million or to million versus million in we believe the decline in sales of synthetic bone products has resulted from our deliberate transition of sales and distribution focus to spinal procedures since our merger with cross in while this shift has benefited our spinal implant product sales  we believe it has also resulted in a reduction in sales of synthetic bone products for non spine procedures such as trauma and revision total joints 
we intend to explore supplemental distribution alternatives in with the goal of recapturing lost sales in non spine procedures  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
total domestic sales of spinal products and orthobiologic products increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of international sales were essentially unchanged at million for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   gross margin as a percentage of sales was  compared to for the year ended december  total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during the same period of research and development expenses in increased by  or million  due primarily to salaries for additional engineers hired for development projects along with associated supply expenses and consulting fees 
selling and marketing expenses in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased commissions on higher domestic sales in general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  in  primarily as the result of decreased corporate bonus expense and lower product liability insurance premiums as a result of more favorable rates 
during the second quarter of  a non recurring charge of  was recorded in connection with the withdrawal of a proposed secondary public stock offering 
total interest and other income increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  during the same period of  as higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances in increased interest income and the elimination of long term debt in reduced interest expense 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
during  the income tax provision was partially offset by the elimination of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  resulting in the comparatively lower effective rate

the following table presents sales by category in thousands year ended december  change amount percent spinal implant product sales    orthobiologic product sales    total sales    sales of spinal implant products increased in the year ended december  by million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects continued market penetration of the synergy spinal system  aided by improved distribution and territory coverage 
sales of orthobiologic products increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our new agf related products  which were launched on a nationwide basis during the second quarter of  accounted for million of orthobiologic products sales during sales of synthetic bone products remained relatively level for the two periods 
total domestic sales of spinal products and orthobiologic products increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of international sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of for the year ended december   gross margin as a percentage of sales was  compared to for the year ended december  spine products sales  which have a lower gross margin than orthobiologic products sales  comprised a greater percentage of total sales in than in total operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million  compared to total operating expenses of million during the same period of excluding merger related expenses  restructuring charges and non recurring charges recorded in  operating expenses increased million  or  but decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses in increased by  or  due primarily to salaries for additional engineers hired for spinal implant development projects 
selling and marketing expenses in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to increased commissions on higher domestic sales in and the hiring of additional sales and marketing staff 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  in  primarily as the result of increased corporate bonus expense and higher product liability insurance premiums resulting from increased sales offset partially by a decrease in property taxes resulting from the closure of the ohio facility 
total interest and other income were approximately the same in the two periods  as reduced interest income on lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances in was mostly offset by reduced interest expense 
we had lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances in compared to due to the payment of merger related expenses  restructuring charges and non recurring charges  the repurchase of  shares of our common stock and the redemption of convertible debentures 
interest expense was lower in than in due primarily to the write off of prepaid debt issuance costs associated with convertible debentures which were redeemed during this redemption also lowered interest expense in in  despite a pre tax loss  taxable income was recognized as a result of some disallowed merger cost deductions 
this coupled with the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a net tax provision of  in  our increased profitability eliminated the remaining valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this resulted in the need to record an income tax provision for the year ended december  at an effective tax rate of approximately 
liquidity and capital resources in  our operations generated positive cash flow of approximately million 
another significant source of cash in was million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we invest our excess cash in us treasury securities and high grade marketable securities 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  up million from million at december  we also have a million revolving line of credit available to us that had no amount outstanding at december  and which expires in june we currently intend to seek an extension of that facility 
we have used and may continue to use our cash  our common stock  or a combination of both to pay for purchased technologies  product lines  mergers and acquisitions 
we also intend to continue to invest in the development of our business 
we believe we currently possess sufficient resources to meet the cash requirements of our operations for at least the next year 
however  some of the aforementioned activities may require cash in excess of that which we currently possess  and we can give no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalent balances and marketable securities 
however  as all of our investments are in short term instruments  we believe that we have no material market risk exposure
