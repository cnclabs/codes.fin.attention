item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations introduction the year was marked by a significant improvement in rig activity and cash flow for the company 
rig utilization and dayrates improved substantially in the company s gulf of mexico drilling markets  as a result of the increase in spending by oil and gas operators in response to significantly higher oil and gas prices and an increase in demand for natural gas in the us in addition  rental tool activity increased substantially for quail 
while the company reported a loss for the year  operating results were substantially improved over the prior year  and the company s financial position and prospects going forward have improved

management believes that the company will benefit from being closer to certain customers  competitors and vendors 
in addition  management anticipates the long term savings from the consolidation of offices and other administrative cost cutting steps will offset the moving expenses for retained employees and severance costs for terminated employees 
during the second quarter of  the company reorganized its drilling operations and administrative functions to enable more efficient management and administration of worldwide operations and to reduce operating and overhead costs 
prior to the reorganization  the company s business segments were designated as land drilling  offshore drilling and rental tools 
mallard and hercules made up the offshore drilling segment and since the time of their acquisitions  each company maintained its existing organization structure  both operationally and administratively 
the reorganization in resulted in the consolidation of the land and offshore drilling operations into two new segments  us drilling operations and international drilling operations

in addition  one platform rig which had operated in the gulf of mexico was sold during the company s rental tool revenues decreased million to million during as compared to fiscal rental tool revenues were impacted during mainly due to depressed drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
profit margins revenues less direct operating expenses of million in reflected a decrease of million from the million recorded in fiscal the us and international drilling segments recorded profit margin percentages profit margin as a percent of revenues of percent and percent in  as compared to percent and percent in fiscal the significant reduction in utilization and drilling dayrates during accounted for the significant declines in profit margin percentages 
the company s rental tool business had a slight increase in profit margin percentage to percent from percent 
results of operations as compared to continued depreciation and amortization increased million to million in as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to two major construction projects  rig and rig  that completed construction and began depreciating during the third quarter of in addition  recognized a full year of depreciation expense on the assets of hercules and a full year of amortization of goodwill associated with the purchase compared to only eight months depreciation and amortization in fiscal general and administrative expense increased million  due primarily to severance costs incurred as part of management s restructuring of operations in early referred to previously

other matters business risks internationally  the company specializes in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  the company primarily drills offshore in the gulf of mexico with barge  jackup and platform rigs for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on us operations 
due to the locations in which the company drills  the company s operations are subject to interruption  prolonged suspension and possible expropriation due to political instability and local community unrest 
further  the company is exposed to liability issues from pollution arising out of its operations 
the majority of such risks are transferred to the operator by contract or otherwise insured 
year the company began preparing for year in by replacing critical financial  human resources and payroll systems with year compliant off the shelf software 
the year problem was not the main reason for upgrading the information technology platform  however  it was beneficial in achieving year compliance 
the company also prepared contingency plans to cover failures in its supply chain  communications  civil disturbances and information technology systems 
the company estimates that  was spent during and in its year compliance efforts 
while the majority of those costs were internal salaries  the company s process for tracking internal costs did not capture all of the costs incurred for each individual task on the project 
during the year date transition and throughout the year ended december   the company did not experience any material failure with its information technology or non information technology systems or key customers or suppliers 
other matters continued change in fiscal year on july   the company decided to change its fiscal year end from august to december  effective january  the company filed a quarterly report on form q with the securities and exchange commission covering the transition period of september  to december  indonesian operations due to political and currency instability in indonesia during and  the development of certain power plant projects  in which the company s subsidiaries were involved by providing management  technical and training support to an indonesian drilling contractor  was postponed or delayed 
as a result  the customer  which was leading the development of the projects  defaulted on payments to the indonesian contractor  causing the indonesian contractor to initiate arbitration proceedings against two subsidiaries of the customer to collect these delinquent payments 
in  the arbitration panels awarded the indonesian contractor approximately million  including interest 
due to the uncertainty over the economic viability of the power plant projects and timing of repayment of guarantees by the indonesian government  the indonesian contractor elected to accept a settlement of the outstanding awards  which will result in the payment of approximately million to the company s subsidiaries by the end of
