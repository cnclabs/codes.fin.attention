the company has a loan review program that it believes takes a conservative approach to evaluating non performing loans and the loan portfolio in general 
the loan review program continually audits the loan portfolio to confirm management s loan risk rating system and track problem loans  to insure compliance with loan policy underwriting guidelines  and to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management determines the allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors including reviewing and evaluating the bank s loan portfolio in order to identify potential problem loans  concentrations of credit  and risk factors connected to the portfolio  as well as current local and national economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount that is adequate to provide for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses  in accordance with the company s loan policy  when they are determined by management to be uncollectible 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when they are received 
when management determines that the allowance for loan losses is less than adequate to provide for potential losses  a direct charge is made to operating income

capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios which measure capital against total assets  as well as against total assets  that are weighted based on defined risk characteristics 
at december   the company exceeded all regulatory required minimum capital ratios and met the regulatory definition of a well capitalized institution

liquidity liquidity is the ability of the company to generate and maintain sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and to meet customer s loan demands or deposit withdrawals 
maintaining a stable core deposit base is one of the fundamentals in the company s liquidity management policy 
it is the company s goal to raise cash when needed  at the most reasonable cost  with a minimum of loss 
management carefully monitors its liquidity position and seeks to maintain adequate liquidity to meet its needs

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
other types of market risks do not arise in the normal course of the company s business activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the company manages other risks  as in credit quality and liquidity risk  in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
management s goal is to maintain a reasonable balance between exposure to interest rate fluctuations and earnings 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company monitors the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using a computer simulation model 
the model measures the change in net interest income which results when market interest rates change 
as of december   an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to have a negative impact of on net interest income over the next twelve month period  while a basis point decrease in market interest rates was estimated to have a positive impact of on the company s net interest income 
by comparison  at december  the company estimated an instantaneous basis point rise in rates would have a negative impact of on net interest income during while a basis point decline in rates would have a positive impact of on net interest income during the company aligned its asset liability mix during on expectations that the economy would slow in  and as a result the federal reserve bank board would begin to lower interest rates 
the company increased its short term liabilities through increased municipal certificates of deposits and federal home loan bank advances while at the same time investing in longer term investment securities 
the company expects both an improvement in its net interest margin and the potential for gains on the sale of securities with lower interest rates 
the potential change in net interest income resulting from this analysis falls within the company s interest rate risk policy guidelines 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit rate changes  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results
