item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview veeco is a leader in the development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of a broad line of precision metrology and process equipment used to measure  test and manufacture microelectronic products for the data storage  semiconductor and optical telecommunications markets 
process equipment is primarily used to etch and deposit materials in the manufacture of tfmhs and optical active and passive devices that greatly expand the bandwidth capacity of existing fiber optic networks 
metrology equipment is primarily used to measure critical dimensions of optical and semiconductor devices  as well as tfmhs 
during the past several years  veeco has strengthened both the process equipment product line and the metrology product line with strategic acquisitions 
see item business the company acquisition history above 
veeco s consolidated financial condition and results of operations have been restated to reflect the mergers with cvc  ion tech and digital  as they have been accounted for as pooling of interests 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relationship in percentages of selected items of veeco s consolidated statements of operations to its total net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization expense other expense income  net merger and reorganization expenses loss on sale of leak detection business write off of purchased in process technology write off of deferred charges asset impairment charge total operating expenses operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax provision net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income taxes net loss income years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended december  sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  respectively  accounted for   and of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us increased by approximately million  or  from the increase in us sales is principally associated with a million increase in process equipment sales of ion tech to the optical telecommunications industry 
european sales decreased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
sales in japan and asia pacific increased by million  or  and million  or  respectively  over the comparable period 
the increase in sales in japan principally reflects increased sales of afm products  while asia pacific s increase is primarily due to the february purchase of the slider crown adjust product line 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   increased by million or due to a million or increase in sales  principally to the optical telecommunications industry  partially offset by a decline in sales to data storage customers 
metrology sales of million for the year ended december  increased by million or from the comparable period  reflecting a increase in optical metrology products from the newly acquired metrology businesses of optimag  monarch and the slider crown adjust product lines  as well as a increase in the sale of afms 
industrial measurement sales for the year ended december   of million decreased from the comparable period principally due to the sale on january  of the company s leak detection business 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a increase from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders increased to million primarily due to strong orders for ion tech s spector related equipment  principally to the optical telecommunications industry  which reflected increased orders of  or million  over the comparable period 
metrology orders increased to million reflecting a increase in orders for afms as well as an increase in orders for optical metrology products from the newly acquired metrology businesses of optimag  monarch and the slider crown adjust product lines 
industrial measurement orders decreased to million principally due to the sale on january  of the company s leak detection business 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to in connection with the merger with cvc  the company incurred non recurring charges of million during  of which a million non cash charge  or of net sales  related to the write off of inventory  which has been included in cost of sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased to from in excluding the non recurring charges  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to  due primarily to a decline in data storage process equipment gross margins from levels due to the volume decline  as well as price and cost pressures 
metrology gross margin decreased to in compared to in  due primarily to new product transition in optical metrology  primarily at the company s minneapolis site  which produces the slider crown adjust product line 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million  or  over the comparable period of  due primarily to the continued investment in new products and technology for both the process equipment and metrology businesses as well as investment with respect to acquired businesses which did not have comparable spending in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million  or over the comparable period of as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses represent for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the expansion of direct sales and service presence in both japan and the asia pacific regions  as well as the purchase of commonwealth  optimag and the slider crown adjust product lines  which had lower comparable operating spending in since these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
amortization expense for the year ended december  of million  increased by million  or  over the comparable period of  due to the addition of intangible assets of businesses purchased in and  including optimag  slider crown adjust product line and the atomic force microscope product line 
as previously noted  during  veeco incurred non recurring charges of million in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
of these charges  a million non cash charge related to a write off of inventory included in cost of sales  million represented merger and reorganization costs of which million related to investment banking  legal and other one time transaction costs and million pertained to duplicate facility and personnel costs and million was for the write down of long lived assets 
the company implemented a reorganization plan in an effort to integrate cvc into the company  consolidate duplicate manufacturing facilities and reduce other operating costs 
the million charge for duplicate facility and personnel costs principally related to the closing of the cvc virginia facilities and an approximate person work force reduction  which included both management and manufacturing employees 
during the year  the entire accrual of million for merger and reorganization costs was expended 
the write down of long lived assets to estimated net realizable value related primarily to leasehold improvements  machinery and equipment and intangible assets for cvc s virginia facilities 
in addition  the million non cash write off of inventory principally related to cvc s virginia facilities product line of ion beam etch and deposition equipment 
the company has integrated the technology from this product line into veeco s existing ion beam etch and deposition products 
accordingly  the company has determined that a portion of this product line s inventory is not useable in the future 
during  the company recorded charges of million and million before taxes related to the merger with ion tech and the sale of the leak detection business  respectively 
in conjunction with the optimag acquisition  the company recorded a million write off of the fair values of acquired in process research and development r d projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
on the date of acquisition  optimag s in process r d value was comprised of the oasis version hardware and software component development program that was completed in in conjunction with cvc s acquisition of commonwealth scientific corporation  cvc recorded a million charge for the write off of acquired in process research and development costs  including products in the development stage that had not reached technical feasibility and for which there is no alternative future use 
due to the merger of veeco and cvc  the company implemented a reorganization plan  which included the closing of cvc s virginia facilities 
due to this restructuring  the in process r d program has been abandoned by the company 
during  approximately  has been spent on this program 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  as compared with million  or of income before income taxes in the higher effective tax rate for is due to approximately million of non deductible charges related to the million merger and reorganization charges incurred in conjunction with the merger with cvc 
as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the cumulative effect of this change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million net of income taxes of million which is included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended december  sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  respectively  accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us remained relatively flat  while international sales included a increase in japan and a increase in asia pacific from the comparable period 
the increase in sales in japan and asia pacific principally reflects increased process equipment sales to data storage customers along with increased metrology sales in asia pacific for data storage and semiconductor applications 
during the last years  the company has established subsidiaries in these regions that provide direct veeco sales and service 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   increased by million or from the comparable period  as sales improved across all product lines related to data storage 
the company believes that the shift in data storage sales to process equipment from metrology products in is a result of customers focusing on gmr product qualifications rather than yield improvement 
additionally  of the increase related to strong ion tech sales to the optical telecommunications industry and million additional sales resulting from the commonwealth acquisition in may industrial measurement sales for the year ended december   of million decreased from the comparable period 
metrology sales of million for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  from the comparable period  principally reflecting decreased purchases of metrology products in data storage applications 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a increase from million of orders in the comparable period 
process equipment orders increased to million as a result of an increase in orders of ion beam etch products and strong orders for ion tech s dwdm related equipment 
metrology orders decreased to million reflecting the reduction in orders for inspection equipment for data storage 
industrial measurement orders decreased to million as a result of a reduction in orders of industrial leak detection equipment 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to gross profit for the year ended december  of million represents an increase of million from the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in process equipment gross margin improved to in compared to in principally as a result of increased sales volume 
metrology gross margin improved to in compared to in in spite of the volume decline noted above 
the metrology margin improvement is due to favorable mix and pricing in both the atomic force microscope and optical inspection product lines 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million increased by million  or  over the comparable period of  as the company increased its investment in new product development  primarily for the process equipment product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased million  or over the comparable period of as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses represent for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to an increase in international sales and service personnel and locations 
in  the company accelerated the transition from representative and distributor organizations to direct veeco sales and service capability in japan and asia pacific 
during  the company recorded charges of million and million before taxes related to the merger with ion tech and the sale of the leak detection business  respectively 
in conjunction with the optimag acquisition  the company recorded a million write off of the fair values of acquired in process research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
on the date of acquisition  optimag s in process r d value was comprised of the oasis version hardware and software component development program that was expected to reach completion in march this program includes the introduction of certain new technologies 
at the acquisition date  optimag s r d program was approximately complete  with the remainder completed in on the acquisition date  certain projects within optimag s r d programs were expected  if successful  to begin to bear results in these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
additionally  this project will require maintenance r d after it has reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
management believes the company is positioned to complete the r d program 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the project and there is no assurance that the project will meet with either technological or commercial success 
in conjunction with cvc s acquisition of commonwealth scientific corporation  cvc acquired purchased in process r d  which included the value of products in the development stage that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
accordingly  the amount of million  consisting of four technology groupings ion source products  etch modules  deposition modules and dielectric deposition modules  which had fair values of million  million  million and million  respectively  was expensed in the fair value was determined using the income approach  which involves estimating the discounted after tax cash flows attributable to projects based on the projects stage of completion 
a discount rate of was applied to the projects cash flows and there were no material changes from historical pricing  margins  and expense levels 
due to the merger of veeco and cvc  the company implemented a reorganization plan  which included the closing of cvc s virginia facilities 
due to this restructuring  the commonwealth in process r d program has been abandoned by the company 
during  approximately  has been spent on this program 
during  the company recorded a million pre tax charge for merger and reorganization expenses principally related to the merger with digital  of which approximately million represented severance and other costs and an estimated loss on a future sublease of an abandoned office and manufacturing facility 
at december   approximately  remained accrued for these expenses 
during  the company incurred approximately  of costs that were charged against the accrual 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million  or of income before income taxes  as compared with million  or of income before income taxes in the lower effective tax rate in reflects digital s s corporation tax status for five months in through the merger date 
as an s corporation  digital was not subject to federal income tax at the corporation level 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations totaled million in compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in includes adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided principally from non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to sab  non cash merger and reorganization expenses and a stock option income tax benefit aggregating million plus an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses  deferred gross profit and other current liabilities of million and million  respectively 
these items were partially offset by the net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased due primarily to the increase in customer deposits and advanced billings for current bookings  partially offset by the decrease in income taxes payable 
accounts receivable increased due to the increased sales volume for the increase in inventories is attributable to production ramp for both ion tech products and metrology tools 
the increase in deferred tax benefit is due to future tax deductions related principally to stock options and inventory reserves 
as a result of the merger and reorganization costs incurred in connection with the cvc merger  as well as the income tax benefit associated with the stock option exercises  the company anticipates a refund of income taxes of approximately million 
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  also included operating activities for the three months ended december  related to cvc 
prior to the merger  cvc s fiscal year end was september net cash from operations in resulted from i net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  loss on the sale of the leak detection business  write off of purchased in process technology and a stock option income tax benefit aggregating million plus increases in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable of million and million  respectively 
these items were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and a deferred income tax benefit of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities is principally due to an increase in income taxes payable 
accounts receivable increased due to increased sales volume 
the increase in inventories was attributable to an increase in process equipment orders as well as certain shipments being delayed by customers at december  net cash from operations in resulted from net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  stock option income tax benefit and certain merger and reorganization charges of million and a decrease of accounts receivable of million 
these items were partially offset by increases in inventories and a deferred income tax benefit of million and million  respectively and decreases of accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the increase in inventories resulted from the increased order and sales levels and to support new product introductions through demonstration tools 
net cash used in investing activities in totaled million compared to million in and million in cash used in consisted of million for the purchase of assets of acquired businesses and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by net sales and maturities of short term investments of million  proceeds from the sale of the leak detection business of million and the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
included in the net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  is investing activities for the three months ended december  related to cvc 
prior to the merger  cvc s fiscal year end was september cash used in consisted of net purchases of short term investments of million  million for the purchase of optimag s net assets and million of capital expenditures  partially offset by million of proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment 
the net purchases of short term investments resulted from the proceeds of the company s public offering in february net cash used for investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in compared to million in and million in the generation of cash in primarily resulted from stock issuances of million  partially offset by debt repayments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  also included financing activities for the three months ended december  of million related to cvc 
prior to the merger  cvc s fiscal year end was september the generation of cash in primarily resulted from a public offering by the company in february  proceeds from exercise of stock options and stock issuances under the company s employee stock purchase plan and million net proceeds from borrowings under lines of credit  partially offset by repayments of long term debt 
the generation of cash in resulted from proceeds from borrowings under the lines of credit  stock issuances and proceeds from long term debt of million  million and million  respectively 
this amount was partially offset by repayments of long term debt of million and distributions to former digital shareholders of million 
the company has an unsecured million credit facility the credit facility which may be used for working capital  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate of the lending banks  but such rate may be increased to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flow exceeds a defined ratio 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
the credit facility expires december   but under certain conditions is convertible into a term loan  which would amortize quarterly through december  the credit facility contains certain covenants  including a restriction on the company s ability to pay dividends 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the company s cvc subsidiary also had a million bank line of credit  which allowed for borrowings based on certain financial criteria and which had an interest rate of prime 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this line 
as of december   approximately  was outstanding under this line 
on january   this line was terminated by the company 
in connection with the atomic force microscope acquisition  the company is required to pay approximately million of the purchase price to the seller  due in four equal quarterly installments  with the final payment due on march  as of december   approximately million has been paid 
in connection with the optimag acquisition  the company will be required to pay consideration to the former shareholders of optimag based upon both year sales and the appraised value of optimag 
during the year  approximately  of contingent consideration related to optimag s revenues has been accrued and recorded as an addition to excess of cost over net assets acquired 
the contingent consideration based upon the appraised value of optimag is currently not known 
the amount will be determined by an independent appraiser during the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements including the payments described in the preceding paragraphs through risk factors that may impact future results in addition to the other information set forth herein  the following risk factors should be carefully considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company 
dependence on microelectronics industry  cyclicality of data storage  semiconductor and optical telecommunications industries 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage  semiconductor and optical telecommunications manufacturers which accounted for the following percentages of the company s net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage optical telecommunications semiconductor research industrial the data storage  semiconductor and optical telecommunications industries have been characterized by cyclicality 
these industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
a downturn in the businesses of one or more of the company s customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
veeco s quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect quarterly results include cyclical patterns of capital spending by customers  a downturn in the market for personal computers  network servers  opto telecommunication devices or other products incorporating data storage  opto telecommunications or semiconductor technology  market acceptance of veeco s systems and veeco s customers products  specific economic conditions in the data storage  semiconductor  and optical telecommunications industries  the timing of significant orders and customer acceptance of veeco s products  the introduction of new products by veeco and its competitors  production and quality problems and resulting shipment delays  changes in the cost of materials  and disruption in sources of supply 
many of these factors are beyond veeco s control 
if veeco s net sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  veeco s operating results will be adversely affected  which may have an adverse impact on the company s common stock price 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the data storage  semiconductor and optical telecommunications manufacturing industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
veeco s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon the company s ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced systems at competitive prices and to accurately predict technology transitions 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by veeco s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of veeco s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including veeco s product offerings  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  effective sales  service and marketing  and product performance in the field 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
veeco cannot be certain that it will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders 
customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
the company s net sales and operating results for a quarter may depend upon orders obtained for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
in addition  veeco derives a substantial portion of its net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material adverse effect on veeco s sales and operating results 
veeco s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially and adversely affected if orders are cancelled or rescheduled or if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipping during the period 
highly competitive industry 
the industries in which veeco operates are intensely competitive 
established companies  both domestic and foreign  compete with each of veeco s product lines 
many of veeco s competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  veeco believes that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a particular customer selects a competitor s capital equipment  the company expects to experience difficulty in selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
the company believes that veeco s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of veeco s control  including price  product quality  breadth of product line  system performance  cost of ownership  global technical service and support  and success in developing or otherwise introducing new products 
veeco cannot be certain that it will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on principal customers  industry concentration 
veeco relies on its principal customers for a significant portion of its sales 
veeco s principal customers include seagate technology  inc seagate and international business machines corporation ibm 
the following table sets forth the percentage of veeco s net sales to customers with sales greater than in any of the respective periods year ended december  seagate ibm the loss of a major customer  or of a significant portion of the sales to a major customer  could adversely affect veeco s results of operations 
veeco s ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon veeco s ability to obtain orders from new customers 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to do so 
in addition  a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are veeco s customers  dominate the data storage industry  the semiconductor industry and the optical telecommunications industry 
if any of these large manufacturers discontinues its relationship with veeco or suffers economic setbacks  veeco s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and short term investment portfolios  and foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents  commercial paper  municipal bonds and obligations of us government agencies 
these investments are considered available for sale securities 
accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate market value 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
veeco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects that net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company generally has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
the aggregate foreign exchange gains and losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were   and  in  and  respectively 
the change in currency exchange rate that has the largest impact on translating veeco s international operating profit is the japanese yen 
the company estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by approximately million 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing and operating strategies
