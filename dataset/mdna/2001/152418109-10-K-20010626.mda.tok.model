item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general central bancorp  inc the company is a bank holding company headquartered in somerville  massachusetts 
the company is the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary  central bank the bank  a state chartered co operative bank 
through the bank  the company acquires funds in the form of deposits and uses the funds to make mortgage loans for the construction  purchase and refinancing of residential properties  and to make loans on commercial real estate and business loans in its market area 
the bank also makes a limited amount of consumer loans including home improvement and secured and unsecured personal loans 
the bank has used excess funds to purchase investment and mortgage backed securities 
the operations of the bank are generally influenced by overall economic conditions  the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the banking commissioner  the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the bank monitors its exposure to earnings fluctuations resulting from market interest rate changes 
historically the bank s earnings have been vulnerable to changing interest rates due to differences in the terms to maturity or repricing of its assets and liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank s net interest income and net income could be negatively affected as interest sensitive liabilities deposits and borrowings could adjust more quickly to rising interest rates than the bank s interest sensitive assets loans and investments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the bank s results of operations for the last three years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal years and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
results of operations the bank reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  as compared to million or per diluted share for fiscal after cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and million or per diluted share after cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for fiscal the bank s earnings decrease for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses offset by higher net interest income and a decrease in net gain on investment securities 
the increase in salaries and benefits was impacted by a one time expenditure relating to the settlement of a severance claim 
the bank was able to increase net interest and dividend income during the period despite a fiercely competitive market for loans 
the increase in the cost of deposits resulted from management s decision to aggressively price deposits which caused the overall cost of funds to increase 
fiscal results were reduced by a one time charge of  net of taxes  for costs associated with the establishment  on january   of central bancorp  inc as the holding company for central bank 
this charge represented the balance of unamortized organization costs outstanding as of april   that were required to be written off in accordance with a new accounting rule regarding reporting costs of organization activities 
excluding this cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  central bancorp s net income for the fiscal year ended march   was million or per diluted share 
interest rate spread 
the bank s operating results are significantly affected by its net interest spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and investments and the interest cost of deposits and borrowings 
the interest spread is affected by economic conditions and market factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows

the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates and changes in the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is shown in the following table 
information is provided on changes for the fiscal years indicated attributable to changes in interest rates and changes in volume 
changes due to combined changes in interest rates and volume are allocated between changes in rate and changes in volume proportionally to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

the bank experienced a million overall increase in interest and dividend income for the fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans increased by million to million due to a million increase in average loan balances 
total loans increased by million from march  to march  and the yield on these loans increased by basis points 
the bank originated new loans amounting to million  of which million were adjustable rate loans 
the increase in the loan portfolio reflects a management decision to increase loan originations in a favorable interest rate environment 
as rates have declined during the current calendar year  management has decided to slow down residential lending but expects to continue its emphasis on commercial lending in order to diversify the loan portfolio and improve overall portfolio yield 
additionally  interest and dividend income on investments increased by thousand due primarily to an million increase in average total balances of investments and a basis point increase in the rate earned on investments during fiscal the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets increased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
the bank experienced a thousand overall increase in interest and dividend income for the fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans increased by thousand to million due to a million increase in average loan balances 
total loans increased by million from march  to march  partly offsetting the increase in average loans outstanding was a basis point decrease in the average yield on these loans 
the bank originated new loans amounting to million  of which million were adjustable rate loans 
additionally  interest and dividend income on investments decreased by thousand due primarily to an million decrease in average total balances of investments partly offset by a basis point increase in the rate earned on investments during fiscal the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets increased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense on deposits increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to an increase of basis points in the interest rate paid on deposits from during fiscal to in fiscal  plus an increase in the average total balance of deposits to million during fiscal from million in the prior period 
interest expense on borrowings also increased as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  in addition to an increase of basis points in the rate paid on these borrowings to in fiscal from in fiscal both factors combined to cause a million increase in interest expense on borrowings during fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense on deposits decreased during the fiscal year ended march  by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease can be attributed to a decrease of basis points in the interest rate paid on deposits  from during fiscal to during fiscal  as well as a decrease in the average balance of deposits to million during fiscal from million during fiscal interest expense on borrowings increased as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal and the average rate paid on borrowed funds increased basis points from in fiscal to in fiscal both factors combined to cause a million increase in interest expense on borrowings during fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal while the cost of those liabilities declined by basis points  to in fiscal provision for loan losses 
due to the bank s stable and relatively high level of asset quality  there was no provision for loan losses during fiscal  and at march   and  problem assets totaled  thousand and thousand  representing  and of total assets  respectively 
problem assets are loans days or more past due  real estate acquired by foreclosure and impaired loans 
there were no loans days or more past due at march  loans days or more past due amounted to thousand at march   a decrease of thousand from thousand at march  there were no impaired loans at march  and march  there was no real estate acquired by foreclosure at march   or non interest income 
total non interest income for fiscal was million  compared to million during fiscal the primary reason for the thousand decline was a decrease in gains from the sale of investment securities during fiscal of thousand compared to million during fiscal total non interest income for fiscal was million  compared to million during fiscal the primary reason for the thousand increase was an increase in gains from the sales of investment and mortgage backed securities during fiscal of million compared to thousand during fiscal additionally  during fiscal  the bank sold a non banking facility  realizing a net gain on sale of thousand 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased thousand during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase is primarily attributable to increase in salaries and benefits of thousand  which included a one time expenditure relating to the settlement of a severance claim  in data processing service fees of thousand due to a change in computer processing systems and an increase in other expenses of thousand 
the primary reason for the increase in other expenses were thousand in higher expenditures for promotions  advertising and marketing 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in professional fees during fiscal of thousand due to consulting fees incurred during fiscal relating to a tax planning strategy implemented during fiscal operating expenses increased thousand during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits of thousand  in professional fees of thousand and other expenses of thousand 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in occupancy and equipment expenses during fiscal of thousand 
income taxes 
the objective of the asset and liability method is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the bank s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
during fiscal  the bank s effective income tax expense increased substantially to approximately the statutory rate 
the company instituted certain tax saving techniques in fiscal that resulted in a decline in the effective tax rate 
the effective rates of income tax expense for the fiscal years ended march   and were   and  respectively 
financial condition total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million from million at march  total assets at march  increased million from million at march  during fiscal  increases in the bank s deposits and in borrowed funds were used to fund the increase in loans and investments 
net loans increased million to million at march  from million at march  at march   mortgage loans were million  a million increase from march  during the fiscal year ended march   the bank originated loans totaling million  of which million were fixed rate loans and million were adjustable rate loans 
total loans originated during the fiscal year ended march   totaled million  of which million were fixed rate loans and million were adjustable rate loans 
risk elements 
the improvement in the bank s real estate portfolio continued through fiscal  which resulted in a thousand overall decrease in its problem assets to nil at march  as compared to march  any reversal of the favorable economic conditions experienced during fiscal could result in the bank experiencing increases in problem assets that would negatively affect the bank s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which management considers adequate to provide for inherent probable losses based on an evaluation of known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
such evaluation includes identification of adverse situations that may affect the ability of certain borrowers to repay  a review of overall portfolio size  quality  composition and an assessment of existing and anticipated economic conditions 
while management uses available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making current evaluations 
any such adjustments to the allowance could negatively affect the bank s net income 
additions to the allowance are charged to earnings  realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
investment activities 
the bank s management believes it prudent to maintain an investment portfolio that provides not only a source of income but also a source of liquidity to meet lending demands and fluctuations in deposit flows 
deposits 
total deposits at march  were million  a million increase from million one year earlier 
savings accounts and other types of deposits have traditionally been an important source of funds for lending  investment purchases  and for other general business purposes 
the increase in deposits resulted from management s decision to price deposits in a competitive interest rate environment  which caused the overall cost of funds to increase 
advances from the federal home loan bank of boston 
advances from the federal home loan bank of boston increased to million at march  from million at march  asset liability management and market risk the bank s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the bank seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rate  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by the bank s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the bank s asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the following two tables reflect different methods of disclosing the bank s exposure to a change in interest rates and its potential impact on the bank s net interest income 
the gap analysis uses contractual maturities and next repricing dates  while the market risk simulation measures changes in net interest income as a result of changes in market interest rates 
the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities in both tables would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions provided 
time interval from march  days days days days years years thereafter total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets short term investments   investment securities including stock in the fhlb of boston      adjustable rate loans a         fixed rate loan amortization b       mortgage backed securities amortization b     the co operative central bank reserve fund   total interest sensitive assets         interest sensitive liabilities now accounts c    regular  club and day notice accounts c    money market deposit accounts   term deposit certificates        advances from fhlb of boston         total interest sensitive liabilities         interest sensitivity gap assets minus liabilities         cumulative gap        cumulative interest sensitive assets as a percent of cumulative interest sensitive liabilities cumulative gap as a percent of total assets a adjustable rate mortgage loan amounts and other loans subject to repricing are accumulated as if the entire balance came due on the repricing date 
b amortization is shown in the time period corresponding to the contractual amortization or  when such information was not available  the computed principal amortization based on weighted average maturities and weighted average rates 
fixed rate demand loans are shown in the days category and are usually amortized over longer periods and can be repriced at the option of the bank c although now and regular accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  management considers these accounts to have significantly longer effective maturities and repricing terms  therefore  the majority of such accounts have been included in the thereafter category 
if now and regular accounts had been assumed to be subject to repricing within one year  the cumulative excess of interest sensitive liabilities over interest sensitive assets would have been  or of total assets 
the above table indicates that the company is liability sensitive during the period of one year or less 
accordingly  the bank s net interest income would be negatively affected by a rising interest rate environment since its interest bearing liabilities would reprice upwards more quickly than its interest earning assets 
the bank quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specific time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about the future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments  deposit flows  etc 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management s assumptions is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward and basis points downward in the first year of the model 
the following table indicates the estimated exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next twelve and twenty four month periods percentage changes in estimated net interest income over months months basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates based on the scenario above  net interest income of the company would be adversely affected by either a basis point increase or a basis point decrease in rates in both the twelve and twenty four month periods 
liquidity the bank s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  amortization and repayments of loan and mortgage backed security principal  fhlb of boston advances and maturities of various other investments 
these various sources of liquidity  as well as the bank s ability to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  are used to fund deposit withdrawals  loan originations and investments 
deposits have been a relatively stable source of funds for the bank despite the continued competition in recent years 
during fiscal  deposit balances increased by million to million from million at march  the bank is a member of the fhlb of boston and has the ability to borrow from the fhlb of boston for any sound business purpose for which the bank has legal authority  subject to such regulations and limitations as may be prescribed 
at march  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb of boston advances of million and million  respectively 
the deposits and fhlb advances were used to fund the bank s lending and investing activities during the year 
the fhlb of boston advances are secured by a blanket lien on residential first mortgage loans  investment securities and all stock in the fhlb of boston 
as a member of the co operative central bank  the bank also has the right to borrow from that organization for short term cash needs  by pledging certain assets 
the bank also may obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain of the bank s notes and drafts 
the bank has not exercised these rights 
loan originations  including purchases  totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
at march   outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans totaled million  and commitments for unadvanced funds on home equity  commercial and construction loans totaled million 
currently  the bank does not have any mortgage loans available for sale in the secondary market 
management believes that the bank has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these commitments 
capital resources massachusetts chartered co operative banks with deposits insured by the fdic  such as the bank  are required to maintain minimum capital ratios pursuant to federal banking regulations 
the first standard establishes a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations 
two categories of capital are defined tier or core capital stockholders equity and tier or supplementary capital 
total capital is the sum of both tier and tier capital 
according to the standards  tier capital must represent at least of qualifying total capital 
at march   the minimum total risk based capital ratio required was 
the bank s risk based total capital ratio at march  was to complement the risk based standards  the fdic adopted a leverage ratio stockholders equity divided by total assets of for the most highly rated banks and for all others 
the leverage ratio is to be used in tandem with the risk based capital ratios as the minimum standards for banks
