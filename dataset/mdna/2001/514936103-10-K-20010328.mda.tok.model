item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on february   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of commonwealth and transnation from reliance insurance company  a subsidiary of reliance group holdings  inc the assets and liabilities of commonwealth and transnation have been revalued to their respective fair market values as of that date 
the financial statements of the company reflect the combined operations of the company  including commonwealth and transnation  from the closing date of the acquisition 
overview the company s primary business is the insurance of titles to real property  which is greatly influenced by the real estate economy 
during the three year period from to  the company s title operations benefited from the execution of three distinct aspects of its business strategy 
operations were expanded through the acquisition of title insurance agents and underwriters  including the acquisition of commonwealth and transnation in  expenses were tightly monitored and controlled  and claims experience improved due to quality control efforts and an improved claims environment 
during  the company benefited in particular from the acquisition of commonwealth and transnation  the strong national real estate economy  and a high level of residential refinancing activity 
during  the company decided to place increased emphasis on other products and services related to real estate transactions 
as a result  in october  the company acquired primis  inc  a leading web based provider of real estate services 
the primis acquisition provides the company with a sophisticated technology platform on which to deliver title and real estate related services through its landamerica onestop operations 
revenues the company s operating revenues  consisting of premiums  title search  escrow and other fees  are dependent on overall levels of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  which are influenced by a number of factors including interest rates and the general state of the economy 
in addition  the company s revenues are affected by the company s sales and marketing efforts and its strategic decisions based on the rate structure and claims environment in particular markets 
premiums and fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
operating revenues from direct title operations are recognized at the time real estate transactions close  which is generally to days after the opening of a title order 
operating revenues from agents are recognized when the issuance of a policy is reported to the company by an agent 
although agents generally report the issuance of policies on a monthly basis  heightened levels of real estate activity may slow this reporting process 
this typically results in delays averaging days from the closing of real estate transactions until the recognition of revenues from agents 
as a result  there can be a significant lag between changes in general real estate activity and their impact on the portion of the company s revenues attributable to agents 
in addition to the premiums and related fees  the company earns investment income from its investment portfolio of primarily fixed maturity securities 
investment income includes dividends and interest as well as realized capital gains or losses on the portfolio 
the company regularly reexamines its portfolio strategies in light of changing earnings or tax situations 
factors affecting profit margins and pre tax profits the company s profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate and mortgage refinance activity  policy amount and the nature of real estate transactions 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because the company  like any other title insurance company  has a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
commercial transactions tend to be more profitable than residential transactions 
the company s largest expense is commissions paid to independent agents 
the company regularly reviews the profitability of its agents  adjusting commission levels or cancelling certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expanding operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
the company continually monitors its expense ratio  which is the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses exclusive of interest  goodwill  exit and termination costs and write off of intangibles expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
claims generally  title insurance claim rates are lower than other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles  rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
a provision is made for estimated future claim payments at the time revenue is recognized 
both the company s experience and industry data indicate that claims activity occurs for more than years after the policy is issued 
management uses actuarial techniques to estimate future claims by analyzing past claim payment patterns 
independent actuaries review the adequacy of reserves on an interim basis and certify as to their adequacy on an annual basis 
management has continued to emphasize and strengthen claims prevention and product quality programs 
seasonality historically  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons but is highly subject to changes in interest rates 
the company typically reports its lowest revenues in the first quarter  with revenues increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
in and  the typical seasonality of the title insurance business was influenced by changes in the levels of refinancing activity
