the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
overview we are a manufacturer and supplier of highly integrated  enterprise class storage solutions for computing operations that include windows nt and windows k  unix and linux platforms 
designed for storage intensive environments such as the internet or other mission critical applications  our products include fibre channel storage enclosures  in addition to a complete set of scsi  tape and storage management solutions 
our activities in the information storage industry have evolved through several acquisitions  the first of which occurred in june when we acquired certain assets associated with the storage business in lake mary  florida from seagate peripherals  inc in december  we acquired substantially all the net assets of parity systems  inc in june and july  we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of andataco  inc  located in san diego  california  and in november  we acquired the remaining of andataco 
in early  we completed the transfer of our lake mary manufacturing operations to our san diego facility and moved our corporate headquarters to san diego 
as a result of the acquisition of andataco  we believe that period to period comparisons may not be meaningful because andataco s operating results were not included in our consolidated financial statements until june in january  we acquired substantially all the assets of oneofus company limited  a taiwan based  privately held designer of high performance fibre channel raid controllers and storage solutions for open systems and the san market 
in addition  in january  we sold substantially all of the assets of a wholly owned subsidiary borg adaptive technologies  inc which we had acquired in april  including certain patented technology referred to as adaptive raid  to a subsidiary of qlogic corporation for million 
beginning january with the placement of larry hemmerich as our president and chief executive officer  we have recruited substantially all of our executive management team within the past year 
with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we have received a going concern opinion from our auditors 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our recurring operating losses  our continued experience of negative cash flows from operations and the fact that we are not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our existing bank facility raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
a going concern opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization write down of goodwill loss from operations gain on sale of borg assets interest expense and other  net loss before extraordinary item extraordinary loss from debt extinguishment net loss comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for include a net gain of million from the sale of borg see note to consolidated financial statements and the impairment of unamortized goodwill in the amount of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for include an extraordinary loss of 
million on extinguishment of debt see note to consolidated financial statements and the impairment of unamortized goodwill of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
sales sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in  a decrease of 
million or 
although included a full year of sales resulting from the andataco acquisition as compared to seven months during  our overall sales have decreased primarily as a result of the transition from our older technology legacy products to newer technology solutions 
our current line of products is centered around our new nexstor u high storage enclosures and raid systems 
we began shipping these new generation products in the third quarter of  however  during the second half of the year  the decline in revenues of our older products exceeded the increase in sales of our newer technology products 
delays in shipments of both product lines  resulting from unexpected supplier issues which have since been resolved  also contributed to the revenue decline 
during  our revenues consisted of million in direct sales to end users  million in indirect sales to oems  value added resellers vars and other channel business and million in service revenues 
we have recently experienced significant growth in our indirect customer base and since october  have entered into various agreements with domestic and international oem s and resellers 
we expect further expansion of our indirect business  which we anticipate will provide a significant new source of revenues 
in order to take advantage of the opportunities available in the indirect business channels  we have recently shifted our sales and marketing strategy to provide greater technical  marketing and sales support to our indirect sales function 
as part of this strategy  since january we have reduced our direct sales personnel and related costs  and have begun to refocus our direct sales team to designated markets such as the federal government and companies in the oil and gas industries as well as existing large customers 
during the first quarter of  the company s total sales were approximately million 
cost of sales gross margin gross margins increased from in to in gross margins in both periods were adversely affected by less than full utilization of production capacity due to lower than expected sales levels as well as increases in inventory reserves due to obsolete inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix which fluctuates from time to time 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of sales from million of sales in the 
million increase is primarily the result of the inclusion in of a full twelve months of expenses related to the andataco acquisition  as compared to seven months included in operations  partially offset by an approximate million provision for uncollectable receivables in we expect these costs to decrease during fiscal as a direct result of the reduction in our overall workforce in january as part of the restructuring of our sales and marketing efforts discussed under sales 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  amounted to million  representing of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in during january  we sold substantially all of the assets of our borg subsidiary  which had contributed 
million to our research and development expenses during the decline in costs resulting from this sale was more than offset by additional costs incurred in in connection with the development of our new product line as well as the inclusion of a full year of expenses related to the andataco acquisition 
we believe that considerable future investments in research and development will be required to remain competitive and we expect these expenses will continue to increase in future periods 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are substantially incurred in advance of related revenues  or in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  from million in these increases were primarily due to a full year of amortization over seven years of million of goodwill associated with the andataco acquisition  effective in june and november  and million of goodwill over seven years associated with the january acquisition of the assets of oneofus  partially offset by reduced amortization resulting from the fourth quarter write down of million of goodwill related to our parity acquisition 
the parity goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of our inability to generate future operating income from the assets acquired in the parity acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of see note to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a goodwill write down of approximately million 
this write down eliminated all unamortized goodwill related to the acquisition of andataco 
the andataco goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of our inability to generate sufficient future operating income from the assets acquired in the andataco acquisition 
interest expense interest expense decreased 
million to million in  primarily as a result of the satisfaction of borrowings of million by the issuance of common stock million in december and million in april 
this reduction was partially offset by a full twelve months of interest on the million note issued in connection with the andataco acquisition as compared to seven months of interest in income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
preferred stock dividends during and  all classes of our convertible preferred stock required dividends at per annum 
preferred stock dividends decreased by 
million to 
million during principally due to the conversion of million of preferred stock to common stock in  partially offset by the issuance of million of preferred stock in june during  we recorded 
million as an additional embedded dividend attributable to the fair value at the date of grant of warrants issued in connection with the sale of series e convertible preferred stock based on the black scholes option pricing model and the beneficial conversion privilege on series a convertible preferred stock representing the difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of common stock at the date of issuance 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  we reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for fiscal included an extraordinary loss of 
million on extinguishment of debt see note to consolidated financial statements and a write down of unamortized goodwill for approximately million see note to consolidated financial statements 
sales sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million during the preceding year  an increase of million or primarily resulting from the acquisition of andataco in june this increase was partially offset by delays in the market introduction of certain new generation products and our elimination of non storage related businesses  including memory and integrated systems divisions approximately million in during the second quarter of  we entered into an oem agreement to supply high performance raid storage enclosures to sgi  a major server manufacturer 
the initial term of the arrangement was expected to be for three years 
between may and october  sales to sgi totaled approximately million 
in the third quarter of  sgi made the decision to phase out their windows nt product to which our storage systems were attached 
as a direct result  actual shipments to sgi subsequent to october were minimal 
sgi accounted for of our net sales for two oem customers  discrete logic and intergraph corp  accounted for and  respectively  of net sales 
cost of sales gross margin gross margin for increased to from for contributing to the improved gross margins were the andataco product sales and the utilization of andataco s sales channels to market our products 
during and  gross margins reflect write downs due to obsolete inventory amounting to million and million  respectively 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix which fluctuates from time to time 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative costs for increased to million of sales from million of sales for this increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of andataco  which was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses at our lake mary location 
the reduction in expenses at that location was primarily attributable to the elimination of expenses associated with the integrated system division that was sold in october the most significant increase in expenses resulted from compensation and related benefits of additional employees brought about by the andataco acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses for amounted to million  representing of sales as compared to when expenses were million or of sales 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred and may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are substantially incurred in advance of related revenues  or in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization increased to million for from million for  principally due to the acquisition of andataco  which added million of amortization of goodwill and 
million of depreciation in during the fourth quarter of we recorded a goodwill write down of approximately million 
this write down eliminated all remaining unamortized goodwill related to the acquisition of parity 
the parity goodwill was determined to have been impaired because of our inability to generate future operating income from the assets acquired in the parity acquisition 
interest expense interest expense in increased million over as a result of the acquisition of andataco which significantly increased our net average borrowings 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
preferred stock dividends eitf addresses accounting for preferred stock which is convertible into common stock at a discount from the market rate at the date of issuance 
in accordance with this eitf  a preferred stock dividend attributable to such a beneficial conversion privilege should be recorded for the difference between the conversion price and the quoted market price of common stock at the date of issuance 
accordingly  during we recorded 
million as an embedded dividend attributable to the beneficial conversion privilege of certain classes of our convertible preferred stock as compared to million in in addition  for the year ended december   all classes of our convertible preferred stock required cumulative dividends at and aggregated 
million as compared to 
million in the increase was principally due to additional issuances of preferred stock in liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
this contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the consolidated financial statements  we have suffered substantial recurring net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  have negative working capital and a shareholders deficit at december   and are in default under our existing bank credit facility 
these matters  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in early  in an effort to bring us to profitability  we successfully recruited a new executive management team 
during most of  our management team formulated and implemented our current product strategy centered around our nexstor u line of storage area network san ready storage solutions 
this strategy included the transition from our older technology legacy products to the newer technology solutions  which we began shipping in the third quarter of during the second half of the year  the decline in revenues of our older products exceeded the increase in sales of our newer technology solutions  which contributed to our operating loss 
however  we have recently experienced growth in our indirect customer channel base original equipment manufacturers oems  value added resellers vars and system integrators 
since october  we have entered into various agreements with domestic and international oems  vars and system integrators 
in addition  we have received indications of approval from a number of other indirect customers 
in  indirect sales represented a small percentage of our total sales revenues 
in an effort to capitalize on this growth trend and simultaneously reduce operating costs  we recently shifted our sales and marketing strategy to provide an emphasis on our indirect sales function 
as part of this strategy  since january  we have reduced our direct sales personnel and related costs  and have begun to focus our direct sales team to certain designated markets 
our operating results are expected to be positively affected by an increase in indirect sales  however  there is no assurance that an increase will occur 
historically  we have been successful in securing significant amounts of equity and debt financing to support our operating deficits 
since late and through april   we obtained net cash proceeds of million from private investors  including million since december  of these amounts  million was received from h 
irwin levy  our chairman of the board and a principal shareholder  or companies controlled by mr 
levy collectively  mr 
levy 
additional cash of approximately million was obtained during january when we sold substantially all the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  borg adaptive technologies  inc see note to consolidated financial statements 
effective april   holders of all of our notes payable totaling million including  in accrued interest on that date  verbally agreed to exchange their notes for series h and series i convertible preferred stock the exchange with a stated value of million including million held by mr 
levy 
if the exchange is completed  as of april   our only outstanding debt  other than our trade payables and other operating liabilities  will consist of our bank line of credit  and our shareholder s equity will increase by million 
on april   our series g preferred stock held by mr 
levy with a stated value of million was converted into series i convertible preferred stock with a stated value of million 
the series h and i convertible preferred stock accrues dividends at per annum  payable quarterly  and is convertible into shares of our common stock based on a fixed conversion price of 
per share  the closing market price on the date prior to the exchange 
we are currently exploring various alternatives for raising additional debt or equity capital to finance our short term and long term plans as well as operating deficits expected to be incurred until we begin to generate positive operating cash flows 
we expect to be able to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our working capital needs during the next twelve months  as presently contemplated 
however  due to conditions in the technology related financial markets and other uncertainties  many of which are outside our control  there can be no assurance that such required additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to management  if at all  or that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future 
our revolving credit facility bank line of credit provides for borrowings based on the lesser of million or i of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  plus ii the lesser of million or of eligible inventory  as defined 
effective april   interest under the bank line of credit was increased from prime plus 
to prime at december  plus 
the bank line of credit matures in april  requires a facility fee of 
based on the average unused portion of the maximum borrowings  contains a default interest rate provision of an additional  is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  and provides for certain financial covenants  including minimum net worth and net income requirements 
as of december   the outstanding balance of the bank line of credit was million and an additional approximately 
million was available based on eligible collateral 
at december   we were not in compliance with our minimum net worth and net income covenants under our bank line of credit and are in technical default under the compliance provisions 
we are currently in discussions with the lender to amend those covenants 
although management believes we will be successful in these discussions  there can be no assurance of this success nor that management will be successful in obtaining a replacement lender with acceptable terms if we are not successful 
on may   we entered into an agreement with a private investment group granting us a one year million equity line or equity draw down facility 
the agreement does not obligate us to draw any of the funds 
once per draw down period  we may request a draw of up to million  subject to a formula based on average stock price and average trading volume  setting the maximum amount of any request for any given draw 
the amount of money that the investment group will provide to us and the number of shares that we will issue to the investment group in return for that money is settled on a weekly basis during a day trading period following the draw request based on a formula as defined in the stock purchase agreement 
the investment group receives a discount to the market price for the day period and we receive the settled amount of the draw down less a fee payable to the placement agent 
as of december   we have issued  shares of common stock and received million in net proceeds pursuant to this agreement 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern 
cash flow results operating activities net cash used by operating activities amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the most significant use of cash for both fiscal years was our loss from operations before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million in and million in the most significant source of cash for was the reduction of accounts receivable of million  which was more than offset by a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the loss from operations was partially offset by a million decrease in inventories  and a 
million decrease in accounts receivables 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  amounted to million principally due to million in net cash proceeds from the borg sale 
cash used for acquisitions totaled 
million and million during and  respectively

net cash provided by financing activities for amounted to million  and primarily consisted of net borrowings of million  million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and million from the issuance of common stock including million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during both years  we paid 
million in preferred stock dividends 
effect of inflation during recent years  inflation has not had an impact on our operations and we do not expect that it will have a material impact in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate bank line of credit
