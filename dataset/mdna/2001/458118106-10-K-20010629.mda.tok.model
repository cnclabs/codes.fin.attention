item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we achieved record financial results in fiscal strong volume growth and favorable pricing in both the communications and high performance logic product segment and the srams and other product segment  together with our efficient cost structure  resulted in all time highs for revenues  gross margin and operating income 
our financial condition strengthened considerably during the year 
we ended fiscal with little debt and million in cash and investments  excluding our shares in pmc sierra  inc pmc 
recent developments deteriorating business conditions  particularly in the communications infrastructure markets served by many of our largest customers  resulted in a decrease in revenues in our fiscal fourth quarter  compared to the preceding quarter 
on may   we announced that we expect revenues to decrease by approximately in the first quarter of fiscal  compared to the preceding quarter 
on june   we announced plans to reduce our workforce to align with the lowered outlook for revenues see subsequent events  below 
results of operations revenues 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the million recorded in fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  our revenues increased by million or 
the increase in revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased unit volumes and higher average selling prices in both of our product segments communications and high performance logic  and srams and other 
the increase in volume for the communications and high performance logic segment is mainly attributable to the introduction of new products  primarily for data networking and wireless communications infrastructure equipment markets  as well as continued high levels of demand for existing products serving these and other markets 
unit volumes for our srams and other segment also improved from fiscal to fiscal  due to continuing high levels of demand for industry standard products in this segment 
improvements in the mix of units sold  and in the level of demand for industry standard products related to available supply  resulted in a higher asp average selling price in fiscal compared to the preceding year 
unit volumes declined significantly for both product segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal some of our largest customers warned of slowing end demand  deteriorating financial prospects and large inventories of semiconductor components  including those families of integrated circuits that we supply 
we expect that unit volumes  product pricing particularly in the sram and other product segment and sales to major customer accounts will experience further substantial declines in the first quarter of fiscal  compared with the immediately preceding quarter 
while we believe that our products are being consumed in our customers systems at a higher rate than reflected in our estimated revenue for the first quarter of fiscal  we cannot determine with precision when customers will have fully consumed their excess inventories of our products 
during fiscal  we entered into a cross license with intel corp 
intel and received as consideration million 
of this amount  million was recognized as revenue in the second quarter of fiscal the remaining revenue associated with the cross license with intel is being recognized over seven years  the estimated remaining useful life of the relevant intellectual property 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  our gross profit increased by million 
on an operating basis excluding restructuring  asset impairment  and other special costs and benefits  gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
factors that contributed to the improvement in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal include higher unit volumes and revenue  increased manufacturing capacity utilization  improved product mix within the communication and high performance logic segment  higher sram and logic product pricing  and manufacturing cost reductions 
the latter included the sale of a wafer fabrication facility located in sydney  australia  that we had acquired in our merger with quality semiconductor  inc qsi  and the negotiation of significantly lower subcontractor prices for assembling certain of our products  in exchange for our concentrating production volumes with a smaller group of suppliers 
average gross margin for products within the srams and other segment were significantly below our overall gross margin in fiscal our gross margin percentage declined from a record in the third quarter of fiscal to during the fourth quarter  and is expected to decline to the mid s as a percentage of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal all margin percentages are on an operating basis  as described above 
the near term future declines in expected gross margin percentage relate primarily to reduced utilization of our fixed asset base as a result of expected revenue declines 
to a lesser extent  lower product prices particularly in the sram and other segment began to have an adverse impact on gross margins as we entered fiscal we expect that future improvement in quarterly gross margin percentage during fiscal will be primarily dependent upon a resumption of revenue growth 
the improvement in our gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher revenues primarily associated with increased unit sales  and cost savings associated with the consolidation of wafer fabrication production late in fiscal  including the closure of one fabrication facility 
consolidation of production allowed us to improve the utilization of our remaining fabrication facilities  resulting in a lower overall cost per unit produced 
our gross margin also improved in fiscal over fiscal because of a reduction in depreciation expense resulting from lower carrying values of impaired manufacturing assets 
special items impacting gross profit in fiscal included million in intel licensing revenue  which carried little related costs  and million in net positive adjustments and reversals relating to the completion in fiscal of restructuring activities commenced in fiscal and finalization of the related accounting 
in fiscal  we recorded a million charge to cost of sales which related mainly to excess sram manufacturing equipment million and certain technology licensing matters million  of which million was reversed later in fiscal upon settlement of certain of these matters 
the net carrying value of this equipment before writedown was million  and after writedown was million 
the excess sram manufacturing equipment charge represented a writedown to estimated fair market value based primarily on appraisals and third party estimates 
the charge was the result of prevailing economic conditions in the sram market  which had undergone declines in both demand and price 
the charge for manufacturing equipment resulted in annual depreciation expense savings of approximately million 
also in fiscal  we recorded an r d expense charge of million relating primarily to discontinuing certain technology development initiatives see research and development below 
additionally  we recorded a million charge in fiscal which related primarily to an asset impairment reserve recorded against the manufacturing assets of our wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  ore 
we determined that due to excess industry capacity and low prices for semiconductor products manufactured in the hillsboro facility  future undiscounted cash flows related to its wafer fabrication assets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
as a result  we wrote down these assets to estimated fair market value based primarily on appraisals and estimates from independent parties 
of the million  million was related to certain patent claims against us 
we subsequently reversed million in fiscal upon final settlement of these claims 
as a result of asset impairment charges in fiscal  which reduced the carrying value of manufacturing equipment  our annual depreciation expense was reduced by approximately million 
we incurred restructuring charges of million in fiscal related primarily to a provision for exit and closure costs associated with our san jose  calif  wafer fabrication facility  which we closed in fiscal we completed the sale of this facility in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million reserve adjustment  benefiting gross profit  upon the settlement of a legal dispute 
as a result of the restructuring actions  we realized annual cost savings in depreciation  labor  equipment and other costs of approximately million  which were fully realized in fiscal research and development 
for fiscal  research and development r d expenses increased by million to million compared to fiscal r d expenses decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in r d expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to higher spending for product  process  and applications r d to support the communications and high performance logic product segment and  to a much lesser extent  the srams and other segment 
the spending growth included higher personnel and profit dependent costs  increased expenditures on contract design services  the expansion of our remote design centers in georgia  texas  and australia  and higher cost allocations to r d from our manufacturing infrastructure related to new product introductions 
the decrease in r d expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to three principal factors 
first  expenses related to process technology development were reduced because of the closure of our san jose fabrication facility and the consolidation of all process development activities at the hillsboro facility 
second  the allocation of manufacturing costs associated with process r d decreased in fiscal as a result of improved manufacturing facility utilization at our remaining facilities 
with increased utilization of equipment for production activities  allocations of costs to r d activities decreased based upon the mix of activities performed 
third  expenses to develop x microprocessor products decreased in the second half of fiscal  as we wound down our x microprocessor activities 
r d expenses in fiscal also included million in charges  primarily related to discontinued product development efforts  including a graphics chip and a specialized logic chip 
cost savings associated with discontinuing these efforts were approximately million per quarter 
we expect that in fiscal  r d expense will remain relatively flat in absolute dollars from fiscal s levels  but increase in percentage terms 
considering the weak business environment as we enter fiscal  further growth in r d headcount is expected to be modest  with new product development focused in such areas as fifos and multi ported communications products  networking and switching products  ip coprocessors incorporating cam content addressable memory technology  timing and clock products  integrated communications processors  and telecommunications products  including those which provide gateways for voice traffic over the internet 
in addition  we are continuing to develop advanced manufacturing process technologies designed to enable performance advantages and to enhance production levels 
selling  general and administrative 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses rose by million to million compared to fiscal sg a expenses were essentially flat for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in sg a expense for fiscal to fiscal was mainly the result of higher profit and revenue dependent personnel expenses 
we have instituted cost control measures because of current weak business conditions as we enter fiscal see subsequent events  below 
we expect that sg a spending will decline in absolute dollar terms during fiscal  but increase in percentage terms when measured against a smaller revenue base 
merger expenses 
we incurred million in expenses related to the qsi merger in fiscal  including million in severance and employee retention costs 
in fiscal  we spent approximately million in connection with this merger 
gain on equity investments  net 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the merger between pmc and quantum effect devices  inc qed  we exchanged our qed shares for shares of pmc 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded a pretax net gain of million based on the closing share price of pmc on august   the date of the merger 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we sold  of our pmc shares  receiving million in proceeds and recognizing a pretax net loss of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain equity investments  principally our investment in pmc  that we judged to have experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we continue to hold  shares of pmc with a basis of per share 
as of may   the closing share price of pmc was 
in fiscal  we sold a portion of our qed shares and recorded a pretax gain of million 
interest expense 
interest expense during fiscal and was primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes  secured equipment financing agreements which amortize over the term of the agreements  and a mortgage 
substantially all of the notes were converted into common stock in the first quarter of fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
primarily as a result of the conversion  interest expense decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income other income  net interest income and other  net the increase in interest income from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was mainly the result of higher average investment balances  which grew as a result of cash generated from operations 
special items included in other income  net  in fiscal included net gains of million primarily related to the sale of our x design subsidiary and related intellectual property  and a gain of million on the sale of our san jose fabrication facility 
other income  net for fiscal and includes losses of million and million  respectively  related to our equity interest in clear logic  inc our clear logic investment was fully amortized in fiscal taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
this tax rate was lower than the federal rate primarily due to deferred gains on investments  the reversal in fiscal of most of the valuation allowance reserve recorded against our net deferred tax assets  and the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
in fiscal  our tax rate was  primarily due to the use of net operating losses and tax credit carryovers to reduce our tax liability 
in view of the cumulative losses incurred during fiscal  and the significant doubt as to whether our net deferred tax assets were realizable  we recorded a reserve for all of our net deferred tax assets in fiscal we realized no federal tax benefit in fiscal because of our inability to carry back losses 
during fiscal  we released the existing reserve for valuation allowances  with the exception of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards relating to qsi  based on our profitability in fiscal and expectations of future profitability 
historically  income taxes in state jurisdictions have not been significant  due mainly to tax credits 
we enjoy certain tax benefits in malaysia and the philippines  mainly as a result of tax holidays and certain investment incentives 
we currently expect our tax rate to be approximately for fiscal  excluding the impact of costs related to acquisitions 
our estimate is based on existing tax laws and our current projections of income and distributions of income among different tax entities  and is subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition is strong  as a result of substantial cash flow from operations during fiscal and  combined with cautious spending on manufacturing infrastructure 
our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments  excluding our shares of pmc  grew to million at april   a million increase compared to april  net cash provided by our operating activities totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily related to growth in operating income 
cash from operating activities in fiscal was relatively low due to our net loss in that year  partially offset by noncash items related to our restructuring and asset impairment activities 
we used million  million and million for investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal included million for net purchases of investments  and capital expenditures of million 
in fiscal  we received million in proceeds from the sale of property  principally our san jose wafer fabrication facility  which partially offset capital expenditures of million 
in fiscal  capital expenditures of million represented our most significant investing activity 
our financing activities used million in fiscal for fiscal and  they provided million and million  respectively 
significant financing activities in fiscal included repurchases of common stock million  which more than offset proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee option and purchase plans million 
in fiscal  proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee option and purchase plans million accounted for most of the cash provided by financing activities 
in fiscal  we entered into several leaseback transactions for previously purchased equipment which generated million in cash proceeds 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  depending upon business conditions  to be financed primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal and we may also investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
subsequent events acquisition of newave 
on april  we completed the acquisition of newave semiconductor corp 
newave 
newave  a privately held  santa clara  calif 
based company with design facilities in shanghai  china  had been engaged in the design and marketing of integrated circuits for the telecommunications markets 
we paid approximately million in cash and assumed stock options valued at million 
we plan to account for this acquisition as a purchase 
based on our preliminary analysis  we anticipate a charge in the first quarter of fiscal for in process research and development in connection with the transaction 
fiscal business developments 
on may   we announced that due to continued weak end demand for communications infrastructure equipment and to ongoing inventory reductions by our customers who supply networking and wireless infrastructure equipment  revenues for the first quarter of fiscal would likely fall by approximately from the level achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal on may   we also announced measures intended to contain costs and bolster our financial performance in light of these weak conditions 
on june   we further announced plans for a reduction in our workforce to align with the weak business environment 
the reduction  which we plan to complete during the first quarter of fiscal  is expected to consist of approximately employees  primarily in our facilities in malaysia and the philippines 
in connection with the reduction in workforce  we will record a million charge in the first quarter of fiscal for severance and other costs 
other 
on june   we repaid our mortgage loan payable related to our salinas facility  which had been due in april we paid a total of million to extinguish this obligation 
on june   an idt investee  monolithic system technology  inc  went public at approximately per share 
the company s holdings of approximately million shares had a previous carrying value of zero and are subject to a six month sales lockup 
factors affecting future results our operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
for example  we had net income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  compared to a net loss of million for fiscal fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  particularly in the sram market  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix of products sold  availability and costs of raw materials  and of foundry and other manufacturing services  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  economic conditions in various geographic areas  changes in demand for our products in the markets we serve  and costs associated with other events  such as underutilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  or other litigation 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the cost of manufacturing  tax and other assets 
as business conditions change  future writedowns or abandonment of these assets may occur 
also  we ship a substantial portion of our products throughout each quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any month do not occur  our operating results for that quarter would be harmed 
further  we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and our operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  our sales and business results would be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of our operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resultant pricing declines have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
such pricing declines adversely affect our operating results and force us and our competitors to modify capacity expansion programs 
as an example  in prior years  a significant increase in manufacturing capacity allocated to industry standard sram components caused significant downward trends in pricing  which adversely affected our gross margins and operating results 
we are unable to accurately estimate the amount of worldwide production capacity dedicated to or planned for the industry standard products  such as sram  that we produce 
our operating results can be adversely affected by such factors in the semiconductor industry as a material increase in industry wide production capacity  a shift in industry capacity toward products competitive with our products  and reduced demand or other factors that may result in material declines in product pricing 
although we are continuing to try to reduce our dependence on revenue derived from the sale of industry standard products  and while we carefully manage costs  these efforts may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effect the above or other industry related factors can have on our results 
demand for our products depends on demand in the communications  and to a lesser extent  computer markets 
the majority of our products are incorporated into customers systems in enterprise carrier class network  wireless infrastructure and access network applications 
a percentage of our products  including high performance logic components  serve in customers computer storage  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for our products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most of our products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer related markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  when all channels of distribution are considered  one customer in the communications market  cisco systems  inc  represents more than of our total revenues 
our product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  we have experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet our or our customers specifications  that have caused delivery delays and quality problems 
while production delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  we could experience manufacturing problems  capacity constraints and or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to our process technologies including die size reduction efforts  and ramping production and installing new equipment at our facilities 
we have wafer fabrication facilities in hillsboro  ore 
and salinas  calif 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
approximately of our total revenues are derived from products manufactured at our fabrication facility in salinas  which is located near an active earthquake fault 
if we were unable to use our facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  our operations would be materially adversely affected until we were able to obtain other production capability 
we do not carry earthquake insurance on our california facilities or related to our business operations  as adequate protection is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
the primary energy source for our manufacturing facilities is electric power 
while we do maintain limited backup generating capability  the amount of electric power that we can generate on our own is insufficient to fully operate these facilities 
we are dependent upon electric power generated by public utilities where we operate our manufacturing facilities 
utility power interruptions can occur at any time in any location 
we have periodically experienced electrical power interruptions in the philippines and california because utilities in these geographies have failed to provide adequate power infrastructure 
while to date we have successfully mitigated the impact of these interruptions  prolonged power interruptions at any of our locations could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
we do not maintain insurance coverage that would help protect against the impact of power interruptions  because we do not believe that such coverage is available on cost effective terms 
historically  we have utilized subcontractors for the majority of our incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than at our own malaysian and philippines assembly and test operations 
we expect to continue utilizing subcontractors extensively to supplement our own production volume capacity 
due to production lead times and potential subcontractor capacity constraints  any failure on our part to adequately forecast the mix of product demand could adversely affect our operating results 
our results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and process technology associated with the hillsboro fabrication facility will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
however  we may not be able to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner  our new products may not gain market acceptance  and we may not be successful in implementing new process technologies 
if we are unable to develop new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than our current products  our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages used by us require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to us due to capacity constraints 
our results of operations would be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials 
we may require additional capital on satisfactory terms to remain competitive 
the semiconductor industry is extremely capital intensive 
to remain competitive  we continue to invest in advanced manufacturing and test equipment 
we could be required to seek financing to satisfy our cash and capital needs  and such financing might not be available on terms satisfactory to us 
if such financing is required but unavailable on satisfactory terms  our operations could be adversely affected 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend by companies to resort to litigation to protect their semiconductor technology from unauthorized use by others 
we have been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected our operating results 
although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have a broad portfolio of patents 
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights could be asserted in the future and could require us to discontinue the use of certain processes or cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to incur significant litigation costs and damages and to develop non infringing technology 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could adversely affect us 
international operations add increased volatility to our operating results 
a substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from non us sales  as summarized below percentage of total revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal north america asia pacific japan europe total in addition  our offshore assembly and test operations incur payroll  facility and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our cost of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for our products 
our offshore operations and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions and import and export controls  and changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we also purchase certain semiconductor manufacturing tools  such as photolithography equipment  from overseas vendors 
such tools are typically quoted at a foreign currency price  often equivalent to several million us dollars per unit 
although we seek to mitigate currency risks through the use of hedge instruments  currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a substantial impact on our net us dollar cost for these tools 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in our manufacturing process 
any failure by us to control the use or discharge of hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our company  other semiconductor companies  or customers 
announcements by us or by our competitors regarding new product introductions may also lead to volatility 
in addition  our stock price can fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially in the technology sector 
our product portfolio includes a mix of proprietary or limited source products  and industry standard or multiple source products 
our products also employ a variety of semiconductor design technologies 
stock price volatility may also result from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market price of our investment in pmc sierra  inc in fiscal  pmc completed a merger with quantum effect devices qed 
as a result of the merger  we exchanged our qed ownership interest for pmc common stock  which is highly volatile 
in connection with the merger  as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded a pretax  unrealized gain of million during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold a portion of our pmc holdings  resulting in a realized  pretax loss of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain equity investments  principally our investment in pmc  that we judged to have experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
the amount of income and cash flow that we ultimately realize from this investment in future periods may vary materially from the previously recognized gain and the current unrealized amount 
we are continuing to monitor and evaluate the impact of the introduction of the single european currency euro 
during the transition period ending december   public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the legacy currency of the participating country 
beginning january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  with the legacy currencies being completely withdrawn from circulation on june  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of the euro s introduction on our pricing policies  foreign currency hedging tactics  and administrative systems and costs 
based on our evaluation  we do not currently expect the cost of any system modifications to be material and do not expect that the euro will have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio typically consists of short term securities that have managed maturity schedules 
as a result of these factors  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as a result of the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes in fiscal  we had only million in debt at april   most of it at fixed rates 
the tax ownership operating lease related to our manufacturing facilities in hillsboro has variable  london interbank offered rate libor based payments 
however  this synthetic lease is collateralized with investments that have similar  and thus offsetting  interest rate characteristics 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of international sales  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to help manage our foreign currency exchange exposures 
we do not enter in derivatives for trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and and determined that a change in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant near term impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows
