item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the statements in this management s discussion and analysis that are forward looking involve numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially 
certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under factors that may affect future results  as well as elsewhere in this report 
overview overview years ended march march march revenue    net income    loss diluted earnings per share the company designs and develops high performance memory products and memory intensive logic products 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronic products  including desktop and portable computers  networking  telecommunications  instrumentation and consumer devices 
the company s business strategy has been to be a supplier of these products  operating on a fabless basis by utilizing independent manufacturing facilities 
during fiscal  dram products accounted for approximately of net revenues  sram products accounted for approximately of net revenues and flash products accounted for approximately less than of net revenues 
this compares to  and of net revenues  respectively  for fiscal the market for memory products used in personal computers is characterized by price volatility and has experienced significant fluctuations and cyclical downturns in product demand  such as the severe price erosion of drams and srams in fiscal  and on june   the company announced that it expected that its revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately to below the million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of lower demand and lower average selling prices of some of its products 
while the company s strategy is to increase its penetration into the networking  telecommunications  instrumentation and consumer markets with its existing sram  dram and flash products and to develop and sell in volume quantities new products complementary to its existing products  the company may not be successful in executing such strategy 
a decline in demand in the personal computer industry or lack of success in developing new markets or new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
results of operations the percentage of net revenues represented by certain line items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated  are set forth in the table below 
percentage of net revenues for year ended march  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit loss operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations gain on investments write down of marketable s ecurities and other investments other income loss  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss before equity in income loss of investees equity in income loss of investees net income loss net revenues revenues years ended percentage change march march march    to to srams    drams    other total    revenues the company s net revenues increased to million in fiscal or approximately  from million in fiscal the increase in net revenues in fiscal was primarily due to a combination of sales of new products  overall increase in average selling prices and an increase in unit sales of the company s sram and dram products during the first three quarters 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s net revenues fell  largely due to a decrease in demand and in some cases a decrease in average selling prices 
the company s net revenues in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
the increase in net revenues in fiscal was due to a higher average selling price and an increase unit shipments of the company s sram and dram products 
net revenue from the company s dram product family in fiscal contributed million or approximately  up from million or approximately in fiscal during the first three quarters of fiscal  sales of the company s mbit dram in both the mbit x configuration and the mbit x configuration  increased significantly  along with an overall increase in the average selling prices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal demand for these products decreased as well as the average selling prices 
dram net revenues for fiscal were million or approximately of total net revenues 
net revenue from the company s sram product family in fiscal contributed million or approximately of the company s revenues up from million or approximately in fiscal during the first three quarters of fiscal  sales of the company s mbit sram in both the v and v fast asynchronous configurations  increased significantly along with an overall increase in the average selling prices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the demand for those products decreased but the average selling prices remained stable 
sram net revenues in fiscal were million  or approximately of total net revenues 
the company continues to focus its effort in selling in the non pc market 
net sales to non pc segments of the market  such as telecommunications  networking  datacom and consumer in fiscal accounted for approximately compared to approximately during fiscal and in fiscal international net revenues in fiscal were million or approximately of total net revenues for fiscal this was an increase of approximately over fiscal international net revenues in fiscal increased approximately over fiscal international net revenues are derived from customers in europe  asia and the rest of the world 
the largest percentage increase in international net revenues was to customers in asia  which increased approximately over fiscal year the increase was due to an overall increase in product demand and higher selling prices during the first three quarters of the year 
during fiscal  no single customer accounted for over of net revenues 
during fiscal  one customer accounted for approximately of net revenues 
two customers accounted for approximately and of net revenues during fiscal on june   the company announced that it expected that its revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately to below the million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of lower demand and lower average selling prices of some of its products 
generally  the markets for the company s products are characterized by volatile supply and demand conditions  numerous competitors  rapid technological change  and product obsolescence 
these conditions could require the company to make significant shifts in its product mix in a relatively short period of time 
these changes involve several risks  including  among others  constraints or delays in timely deliveries of products from the company s suppliers  lower than anticipated wafer manufacturing yields  lower than expected throughput from assembly and test suppliers  and less than anticipated demand and selling prices 
the occurrence of any problems resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
gross profit loss the company s gross profit for fiscal was approximately million  or of net revenues  as compared to million  or approximately of net revenues  for the same period in fiscal  and a loss of approximately million  or approximately of net revenues  in fiscal during third and fourth quarter of fiscal  the company took pre tax inventory charges of million in recognition of lower average selling prices and inventory in excess of demand due to the decline in unit shipments for the company s dram and sram products 
the dramatic improvement in gross profits during fiscal year was primarily the result of higher average selling prices  higher unit sales  and an increased mix of higher margin dram products 
during fiscal  the company recorded million pre tax inventory charges in recognition of lower average selling prices together with the decline in the unit shipments for the company s dram and sram products due to competitive market conditions 
the company is subject to a number of factors that may have an adverse impact on gross profits  including the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sold  and the timing of new product introductions and volume shipments 
in addition  the company may seek to add additional foundry suppliers and transfer existing and newly developed products to more advanced manufacturing processes 
the commencement of manufacturing at a new foundry is often characterized by lower yields as the manufacturing process is refined 
there can be no assurance that the commencement of such manufacturing will not have a material adverse effect on the company s gross profits in future periods 
research and development research and development years ended percentage change march march march to    to revenue    research and    development r d as a percent of revenues research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for engineering design  contracted development efforts  facilities costs  equipment and software depreciation and amortization  wafer masks and tooling costs  test wafers and other expense items 
research and development expenses were approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal as compared to million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal  and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the small decrease in spending between fiscal and was due to lower depreciation expense for r d equipment 
the small increase in spending between fiscal and was higher mask and tooling charges 
during fiscal  the company s development efforts focused on advanced process and design technology involving srams  drams and flash memory products 
the company believes that investments in research and development are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and accordingly  research and development expenses may increase in absolute dollars and may also increase as a percentage of net revenue in future periods 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administration years ended percentage change march march march to    to revenue    selling  general    and administration sg a as a percent of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses generally include salaries and benefits associated with sales  sales support  marketing and administrative personnel  as well as sales commissions  outside marketing costs  travel  equipment depreciation and software amortization  facilities costs  bad debt expense  insurance and legal costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were approximately million or approximately of net revenues as compared to approximately million or approximately in fiscal and approximately million or approximately of net revenues for fiscal the increase in spending between fiscal and was higher sales commissions principally due to the growth in net revenues  travel and an increase in allowances for bad debts 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million discretionary non recurring compensation expense related to the sale of maverick networks  inc maverick to broadcom corporation broadcom 
the decrease in spending in fiscal compared to fiscal was due principally to lower outside sales commissions 
selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in absolute dollars  and may also fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future primarily as the result of commissions  which are dependent on the level of revenues 
gain on investments gain on investments during fiscal was largely attributed to the sale of chartered and broadcom securities 
during fiscal  the company sold  shares of chartered and recorded a pre tax gain of million and sold  shares of broadcom and recorded a pre tax gain million 
in june  malleable completed a merger with pmc sierra  resulting in the company s selling its ownership interest in malleable in exchange for  shares of pmc sierra common stock with a fair market value of million 
upon completion of the transaction in june  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million 
subsequent to the transaction date  the company s investment in pmc sierra is accounted for as an available for sale security in accordance with sfas no 
in may  maverick an entity in which the company had a interest in completed a transaction with broadcom  resulting in the company selling its ownership interest in maverick in exchange for  shares of broadcom s class b common stock 
based on broadcom s closing share price on the date of sale  the company recorded a pre tax gain in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
subsequent to the transaction date  the company s investment in broadcom is being be accounted for as an available for sale marketable security in accordance with sfas during fiscal  the company sold  shares of broadcom stock and realized an additional pre tax gain of approximately million 
at march   the company owned  shares  after being adjusted for a for stock split in february  and recorded an additional unrealized gain of approximately million  which is net of deferred tax of approximately million tax  as part of accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
at march   the company owned  shares of broadcom 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in june  umc  a publicly traded company in taiwan  announced plans to merge four semiconductor wafer foundry units  usc  usic  united integrated circuit corporation and utek semiconductor corporation  into umc and subsequently completed the merger in january alliance received million shares of umc stock for its million shares  or ownership of usc  and approximately million shares of umc stock for its million shares  or ownership of usic 
at march  and  the company owned approximately and million shares  respectively or approximately and of umc  and maintained its and wafer capacity allocation rights in the former usc and usic foundries  respectively 
as the company no longer has an ability to exercise significant influence over umc s operations  the investment in umc is accounted for as a cost method investment 
during the fiscal fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million pre tax  non operating gain as a result of the merger 
the gain was computed based on the share price of umc at the date of the merger ie ntd  or us  as well as the approximately million additional gain related to the sale of the usc shares in april the company has accrued approximately million for the taiwan securities transaction tax in connection with the shares received by the company 
this transaction tax will be paid  on a per share basis  when the securities are sold 
according to taiwanese laws and regulations  of the million alliance s umc shares were subject to a six month lock up or no trade period 
this lock up period expired in july of the remaining  or million shares  approximately million shares will become eligible for sale two years from the closing date of the transaction ie january  with approximately million shares available for sale every six months thereafter  during years three and four ie to 
in may  the company received additional or million shares of umc by way of a stock dividend 
subsequent to the completion of the merger the company accounts for a portion approximately at march  of its investment in umc  which became unrestricted in january as an available for sale marketable security in accordance with sfas at march   the company recorded an unrealized gain of approximately million  which is net of deferred tax of million  as part of accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet with respect to the short term portion of the investments 
the portion of the investment in umc  which is restricted beyond twelve months approximately of the company s holdings at march   is accounted for as a cost method investment and is presented as a long term investment 
as this long term portion becomes current over time  the investment will be transferred to short term investments and will be accounted for as an available for sale marketable security in accordance with sfas the long term portion of the investments become unrestricted securities between and on march   orologic completed a transaction with vitesse  resulting in the company selling its ownership interest in orologic in exchange for  shares of vitesse 
based on vitesse s closing share price on the date of sale  the company recognized approximately million pre tax  non operating gain  which is in fiscal subsequent to the transaction date  the company s investment in vitesse is being be accounted for as an available for sale marketable security in accordance with sfas at march   the company owns  vitesse shares  after distribution made to alliance venture management in may write down of marketable securities and other investments in the past six months  marketable securities held by the company have experienced significant declines in their market value primarily due to the downturn in the semiconductor sector and general market conditions 
management has evaluated the marketable securities for potential other than temporary declines in their value 
such evaluation included researching commentary from industry experts  analysts and other companies  all of whom were not optimistic that the semiconductor sector would recover in the quarter or two or three 
based on the continuing depression in the in investments stock prices from those originally used to record the investment and coupled with the expectation that the stock prices will not significantly recover in the next to months  based on unfavorable business conditions for the companies in the semiconductor industry in general including lower fab capacity at umc  management determined that a write down was necessary as of march  as a result the company recorded a pre tax loss of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the quoted market price of the respective marketable securities as of march  at the end of the fourth quarter fiscal  the company wrote down several of its investments in alliance ventures and recognized a pre tax  non operating loss of approximately million 
this was recorded in the write down of marketable securities and other investments 
in january  the company entered into two derivative contracts agreements with bear stearns and received aggregate cash proceeds of million 
the agreements have payment provisions that incorporate a collar arrangement with respect to  shares of vitesse semiconductor common stock 
as such  under the agreements  the company must pay bear stearns an amount based on the market price of vitesse semiconductor common stock in january  the maturity date of the agreements 
if the stock price of vitesse semiconductor exceeds the ceiling of the collar  then the settlement amount increases by an amount determined by a formula included in the agreements generally equal to the excess of the value of the stock over the ceiling of the collar 
if the stock price of vitesse semiconductor declines below the floor of the collar  then the settlement amount also decreases by the amount determined by a formula included in the agreements generally equal to the excess of the floor of the collar over the value of the stock 
at march   the derivative contracts were in the money to the company based on vitesse semiconductor s market price of on that date 
under the current accounting practice  the company is required to offset the gain on the contracts with the loss on the vitesse stock  both were recorded in the write down of marketable securities in the fourth quarter of fiscal the pre tax gain on the contracts amounted to million  representing their intrinsic value at march  the company has adopted sfas no 
effective april  under sfas no 
 the derivative contracts must be accounted for based on their fair value 
these changes in fair value contracts must be reported in earnings until maturity 
other income expense  net other income expense  net represents interest income from short term investments and interest expense on short and long term obligations 
in fiscal  other expense  net was approximately  compared to a net income of  in fiscal the change from fiscal to fiscal was attributed to higher interest expense on short and long term borrowing 
in fiscal net expense was million 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate for fiscal years   and was   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately million primarily as a result of a write down of marketable securities and other investments of million in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal  the company recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately million  primarily the result of the gains on investments of broadcom  umc and vitesse 
for the year ended march   the company incurred a million pretax loss  million of which was incurred in the quarter ended june  as a result of the fiscal year loss  the lack of carryback potential  and the uncertainty regarding future results due to significant  rapid and unexpected product selling price declines that the company experienced during the first and subsequent quarters of fiscal  management could no longer conclude that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  a full valuation allowance of million was recorded during quarter ended june  equity in income of investees the company  through alliance venture management  invested approximately million during fiscal in five alliance venture funds  alliance ventures i  alliance ventures ii  alliance ventures iii  alliance ventures iv  and alliance ventures v 
alliance ventures i  whose focus is investing in networking and communication start up companies  has invested million in nine companies  with approximately million allocated to this fund 
alliance ventures ii  whose focus is in investing in internet start up ventures has approximately million invested to date in ten companies  with approximately million total designated for this fund 
alliance ventures iii  whose focus is on emerging companies in the networking and communication market areas has invested approximately million in companies and has been allocated up to million for new investments 
alliance ventures iv  whose focus is on emerging companies in the networking and communication market areas has invested approximately million in two companies and has been allocated up to million for new investments 
alliance ventures v  whose focus is on emerging companies in the networking and communication market areas has invested approximately million in three companies and has been allocated up to million for new investments 
several of the alliance venture investments are accounted for under the equity method due to the company s ability to exercise significant influence on the operations of investees resulting primarily from ownership interest and or board representation 
the total equity in the net losses of the equity investees of alliance ventures was approximately million for the year ended march  prior to the umc merger discussed elsewhere  the company had made several investments with other parties to form a separate taiwanese company  usc 
this investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting with a ninety day lag in reporting the company s share of results for the entity 
equity in income of usc reflects the company s share of income earned by usc for the previous quarter 
in fiscal  the company reported its share in the income of usc in the amount of million 
as a result of the merger in january  the company no longer recorded its proportionate share of equity income in usc  as the company no longer has an ability to exercise significant influence over umc s operations 
the investment in umc is accounted for as a cost method investment 
in fiscal  the company reported its share in the income of usc in the amount of million  as compared to million reported in fiscal the decrease in income between fiscal and is primarily due to lower net income and a decrease in the company s ownership percentage from approximately to 
factors that may affect future results the company s quarterly and annual results of operations have historically been  and will continue to be  subject to quarterly and other fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including  general economic conditions  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or its suppliers  anticipated and unanticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of the company s products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  increased research and development expenses associated with new product introductions  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company s products  seasonal customer demand  and the timing of significant orders 
results of operations could also be adversely affected by economic conditions generally or in various geographic areas  other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  a downturn in the market for personal computers  or order cancellations or rescheduling 
additionally  because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses for personnel and new product development to be able to support increased sales levels  the company s results of operations will be adversely affected if such increased sales levels are not achieved 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  product obsolescence and significant price competition and  as a result  are subject to decreases in average selling prices 
the company had experienced significant deterioration in the average selling prices for its sram and dram products during fiscal years   and the company is unable to predict the future prices for its products 
historically  average selling prices for semiconductor memory products have declined and the company expects that average selling prices will decline in the future 
accordingly  the company s ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent on its ability to increase unit sales volume of existing products and to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products 
declining average selling prices will also adversely affect the company s gross margins unless the company is able to significantly reduce its cost per unit in an amount to offset the declines in average selling prices 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase unit sales volumes of existing products  develop  introduce and sell new products or significantly reduce its cost per unit 
there also can be no assurance that even if the company were to increase unit sales volumes and sufficiently reduce its costs per unit  the company would be able to maintain or increase revenues or gross margins 
the company usually ships more product in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with shipments in the third month higher at the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause the company s quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  a disruption in the company s production or shipping near the end of a quarter could materially reduce the company s net sales for that quarter 
the company s reliance on outside foundries and independent assembly and testing houses reduces the company s ability to control  among other things  delivery schedules 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry periodically results in shortages of advanced process wafer fabrication capacity such as the company has experienced from time to time 
the company s ability to maintain adequate levels of inventory is primarily dependent upon the company obtaining sufficient supply of products to meet future demand  and any inability of the company to maintain adequate inventory levels may adversely affect its relations with its customers 
in addition  the company must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of products shipments  and there is a risk that because demand for the company s products is volatile and subject to rapid technology and price change  the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
this inventory risk is heightened because certain of the company s key customers place orders with short lead times 
the company s customers ability to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect the company s liquidity  as the company may be unable to adjust its purchases from its independent foundries to match such customer changes and cancellations 
the company has in the past produced excess quantities of certain products  which has had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company in the future will not produce excess quantities of any of its products 
to the extent the company produces excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected  as was the case in fiscal   and  when the company recorded pre tax charges totaling approximately million  million  million and million  respectively  primarily to reflect a decline in market value of certain inventory 
the company currently relies on independent foundries to manufacture all of the company s products 
reliance on these foundries involves several risks  including constraints or delays in timely delivery of the company s products  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs and loss of production due to seismic activity  weather conditions and other factors 
in or about october  a fire caused extensive damage to united integrated circuits corporation uicc  a foundry joint venture between umc and various companies 
uicc is located next to umc in the hsin chu science based industrial park  where company has products manufactured 
uicc suffered an additional fire in january  and since october  there have been at least two other fires at semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the hsin chu science based industrial park 
there can be no assurance that fires or other disasters will not have a material adverse affect on umc in the future 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the hsin chu science based industrial park  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity could adversely affect the company s foundries ability to supply the company s products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
although the company continuously evaluates sources of supply and may seek to add additional foundry capacity  there can be no assurance that such additional capacity can be obtained at acceptable prices  if at all 
the occurrence of any supply or other problem resulting from these risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  as was the case during the third quarter of fiscal  during which period manufacturing yields of one of the company s products were materially adversely affected by manufacturing problems at one of the company s foundry suppliers 
there can be no assurance that other problems affecting manufacturing yields of the company s products will not occur in the future 
there is an ongoing risk that the suppliers of wafer fabrication  wafer sort  assembly and test services to the company may increase the price charged to the company for the services they provide  to the point that the company may not be able to profitably have its products produced at such suppliers 
the occurrence of such price increases could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
the company conducts a significant portion of its business internationally and is subject to a number of risks resulting from such operations 
such risks include political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  foreign currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
current or potential customers of the company in asia  for instance  may become unwilling or unable to purchase the company s products  and the company s asian competitors may be able to become more price competitive relative to the company due to declining values of their national currencies 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s results of operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
additionally  other factors may materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company relies on domestic and offshore subcontractors for die assembly and testing of products  and is subject to risks of disruption in adequate supply of such services and quality problems with such services 
the company is subject to the risks of shortages of goods or services and increases in the cost of raw materials used in the manufacture or assembly of the company s products 
the company faces intense competition  and many of its principal competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than does the company  any of which factors may place such competitors and potential competitors in a stronger competitive position than the company 
the company s corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake faults  and the company is subject to the risk of damage or disruption in the event of seismic activity 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
it further provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair value  cash flow and foreign currency hedges  and establishes respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the fair value of the instruments 
the statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  effective april   we have adopted sfas no 
 and we are required to adjust hedging instruments to fair value in the balance sheet  and recognize the offsetting gain or loss as transition adjustments to be reported in net income or other comprehensive income  as appropriate  and presented in a manner similar to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
current pending litigation  administrative proceedings and claims are set forth in item legal proceedings and in item licenses  patents and maskwork protection  above 
the company intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation and claims and  subject to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and based upon discovery completed to date  management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
however  should the outcome of any of these actions be unfavorable  the company may be required to pay damages and other expenses  or may be enjoined from manufacturing or selling any products deemed to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
moreover  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company has from time to time received  and believes that it likely will in the future receive  notices alleging that the company s products  or the processes used to manufacture the company s products  infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and the company is subject to the risk that it may become party to litigation involving such claims the company currently is involved in patent litigation 
in the event of litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims such as the current patent litigation  or claims against the company for indemnification related to such third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in favor of the company  could result in significant expense to the company and divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from other matters 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  the company might be required to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  depending upon the number of infringing products and the extent of sales of such products  the company could suffer significant monetary damages 
in the event of a successful claim against the company and the company s failure to develop or license a substitute technology  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company also  as a result of an antidumping proceeding commenced in february  must pay a cash deposit equal to of the entered value of any srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan  in order to import such goods into the us although the company may be refunded such deposits in the future see item legal proceedings  above  the deposit requirement  and the potential that all entries of taiwan fabricated srams from october  through march  will be liquidated at the bond rate or deposit rate in effect at the time of entry  may materially adversely affect the company s ability to sell in the united states srams manufactured wafer fabrication in taiwan 
the company manufactures wafer fabrication srams in singapore and has manufactured srams in the united states as well  and may be able to support its us customers with such products  which are not subject to antidumping duties 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to do so 
the company  through alliance venture management  invests in startup  pre ipo initial public offering companies 
these types of investments are inherently risky and many venture funds have a large percentage of investments decrease in value or fail 
most of these startup companies fail  and the investors lose their entire investment 
successful investing relies on the skill of the investment managers  but also on market and other factors outside the control of the managers 
recently  the market for these types of investments has been successful and many venture capital funds have been profitable  and while the company has been successful in its recent investments  there can be no assurance as to any future or continued success 
it is likely there will be a downturn in the success of these types of investments in the future and the company will suffer significant diminished success in these investments 
there can be no assurance  and in fact it is likely  that many or most  and maybe all of the company s venture type investments may fail  resulting in the complete loss of some or all the money the company invested 
as a result of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s results of operations  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies are subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
if revenues or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters the company s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from march   and approximately million in net working capital  a decrease of approximately million from approximately million at march  additionally  the company had short term investments in marketable securities whose fair value at march  was million 
refer to notes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
during fiscal year  operating activities used cash of approximately million 
this was primarily the result of net loss  the impact of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and the growth of inventory and accounts payable  offset by the non cash investment losses 
cash used in operating activities of approximately million in fiscal year was primarily the result of net income  the impact of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  non cash investment gains related primarily to the merger of usc and usic into umc and broadcom  net of deferred taxes  offset in part by growth in inventory and accounts receivable  accounts payable and taxes payable 
cash used in operating activities of approximately million in fiscal year was primarily due to the operating loss of million

the company believes these sources of liquidity  and financing opportunities available to it will be sufficient to meet its projected working capital and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products  wafer capacity or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling some our short term investments  selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our shareholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including equity investments in or loans to foundries in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  the formation of joint ventures to own and operate foundries  as was the case with chartered semiconductor  umc or tower  or the usage of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
additionally  the company has entered into and will continue to enter into various transactions  including the licensing of its integrated circuit designs in exchange for royalties  fees or guarantees of manufacturing capacity

refer to notes      and for further details 
in the past six months  marketable securities held by the company have experienced significant declines in their market value primarily due to the downturn in the semiconductor sector and general market conditions 
management has evaluated the marketable securities for potential other than temporary declines in their value 
such evaluation included researching commentary from industry experts  analysts and other companies  all of whom were not optimistic that the semiconductor sector would recover in the quarter or two or three 
based on the continuing depression in the in investments stock prices from those originally used to record the investment and coupled with the expectation that the stock prices will not significantly recover in the next to months  based on unfavorable business conditions for the companies in the semiconductor industry in general including lower fab capacity utilization at umc  management determined that a write down was necessary as of march  as a result  the company recorded a pre tax loss of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the quote market price of the respective marketable securities as of march  foreign currency risk based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows over the next fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
as of june   the company owned approximately million shares of umc  a publicly traded company in taiwan 
since these shares are not tradeable in the united states they are subject to foreign currency risk 
the market value of these holdings on june  based on the price per share of ntd and the ntd us dollar exchange rate of ntd per us is us million 
the value of these investments could be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations which could have a material impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the company in the future
