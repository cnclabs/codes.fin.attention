the restatement reflects a reduction in revenues  an increase in bad debt expense  and an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts 
the related adjustments are limited to the company s retail segment 
the restatement also reflects an increase to the gain reported in the company s results from discontinued operations from the sale of medgenesis in the third quarter of fiscal the changes to the financial statements resulting from the restatement are described below 
continuing operations revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management determined that software system and process errors in its retail segment resulted in the overstatement of revenue 
following the implementation of new software systems in early fiscal  certain transactions that had been canceled or rejected at the pharmacy level were transferred from the pharmacy operating system  without adjustment  to the retail revenue accounting system effectively resulting in a duplicate revenue entry 
as a result  revenue was overstated in the company s accounting records 
the overstatement of revenue caused by these errors totaled  in fiscal    and  for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively and  in fiscal   and  for the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
the company has taken steps to correct its systems and processes to prevent duplicate revenue entries 
in addition  management identified a large uncontracted payor in the company s retail segment that began paying claims in fiscal using a significantly lower rate schedule than the payor had previously used 
as a result  the company s traditional methods of estimating the revenue allowance for payor discounts did not accurately account for the significant reduction in reimbursement 
the resulting overstatement of revenue in the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal totaled    and  for the first  second and third quarters  respectively 
the company has taken steps to improve its methods for determining the revenue allowance for payor discounts 
bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts during fiscal  management learned that personnel at the company s retail segment had fallen behind in posting cash receipts to customer accounts receivable records and were preparing aging reports that contained significant inaccuracies  which prevented timely and accurate monitoring of open accounts receivable 
management determined that these inaccurate aging reports they had relied upon to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable at june  and the first three quarters of fiscal had caused them to underestimate the amount of the allowance at those dates 
as a result  management has reassessed its estimate for doubtful accounts receivable and increased the allowance at june  and at the end of each of the first three quarters of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts and related bad debt expense was increased by  at june   and   and  at the end of each of the first  second and third quarters  respectively  of fiscal the company has taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the information on which it will base future estimates of doubtful accounts 
discontinued operations gain on sale of medgenesis the financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal year have also been restated to reflect a correction in the computation of the gain on sale of medgenesis in january the restated gain was million rather than million as previously reported by the company 
in the original determination of the gain  the net book value of medgenesis assets was overstated because certain liabilities had not been properly assigned to medgenesis  which resulted in the gain on sale reflected in discontinued operations being understated by million

the company distributes pharmaceuticals and provides specialized patient management services nationwide for people with long term chronic conditions such as organ transplants  hiv aids  and diseases treated with biotech injectable medications 
chronimed works directly with patients  providers  insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  government agencies and payors to improve clinical and financial outcomes 
chronimed is comprised of two operating segments mail order and retail 
this view best describes the business and reflects how it is managed and resourced 
the mail order segment includes the biotech injectables program  organ transplant medications  and home service medical the home service medical business was sold as of september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the retail segment focuses primarily on hiv aids through the statscript specialty pharmacy stores 
during the year  the company disposed of or shut down certain lines of business together  the disposed businesses 
within the mail order segment  the home service medical hsm business was sold and the diabetes service centers were closed in the first quarter of fiscal within the retail segment  the remaining clinical partners business ceased operations in the second quarter of fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal as restated revenue total revenue for fiscal was up to million from million in fiscal  reflecting strong existing businesses as well as growth from three acquisitions in the second half of the year  which together will be referred to as the acquired businesses 
the existing business and the acquired businesses together will be referred to as the on going business 
the acquired businesses include four retail pharmacies of american prescription providers app acquired in february and a single location pharmacy in sherman oaks  california oaks acquired in april in the retail segment  and the organ transplant pharmacy of sangstat medical sangstat acquired in april in the mail order segment 
overall  these three acquisitions contributed one fourth million of the company s million year on year growth excluding the disposed businesses  as noted below 
by revenue source  fiscal compares to fiscal as follows sources of revenue growth thousands fiscal year as restated change mail order segment on going business   disposed businesses   total mail order   retail segment on going business   disposed businesses  total retail   total company   the mail order segment grew year on year  despite the september sale of the segment s home service medical hsm business and the closure of its diabetes service centers 
excluding these businesses in both years  the year on year growth was 
this growth was driven primarily by the addition of new patients from the biotech injectables contract with aetna that became effective july  the sangstat acquisition in april strengthened the company s position in the transplant market and contributed approximately million in fourth quarter revenue 
the retail segment grew for the year due to continued additions of new patients at existing stores and the acquisition of the app and oaks specialty pharmacies 
the newly acquired stores accounted for approximately one half of the fiscal year growth in the on going business  while same store revenue accounted for the remainder of the revenue growth  with a increase for the year 
the retail segment faced significant reimbursement pressure in fiscal  which lowered the revenue growth  rate and reduced gross margins 
the company has begun to expand its retail product offerings beyond its current hiv aids focus to include organ transplant drugs and biotech injectable medications as a means to enhance future growth and profitability 
cost of revenue and gross profit total gross profit dollars decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margins as a percentage of revenue declined percentage points  from in fiscal to in fiscal however  exclusive of the disposed businesses  higher revenue led to a gross profit dollars increase of million  from million in fiscal to million in  while margins declined percentage points  from to in the respective years 
mail order margins as a percentage of sales declined slightly due to a change in product mix toward lower margin products  a continuing supply shortage of a high margin product beginning in january   and lower than average reimbursement rates under the company s contract with aetna 
two primary factors contributed to a significant decline in retail margins 
first  a large uncontracted payor significantly reduced its reimbursement schedule  which caused an approximate two percentage point decrease in the segment s margins 
second  continued pricing pressures from other payors at existing stores lowered the overall segment margins by an additional two percentage points 
chronimed anticipates that payors will continue to exert downward pressure on the prices we are able to charge as payors seek to contain healthcare costs  which will negatively affect margins in the future 
however  we expect the pricing pressure to be less significant in fiscal than in fiscal the company is working to offset this pricing pressure in a number of ways  including major selling and marketing efforts to drive the more profitable transplant business into both the retail and mail segments  enhanced programs with manufacturers and wholesalers to reduce product costs  and a store by store focus on payor and drug mix to improve gross margins

the company s g a expenses include both corporate g a expenses corporate management  information systems  accounting  human resources and direct segment g a expenses division management  customer service  billing  pharmacy fulfillment

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company consolidated its selling and marketing efforts into one organization serving both the mail order and retail segments 
the company believes this integrated approach will increase the effectiveness of its selling and marketing efforts

the decline is attributed primarily to the cost of the company s pursuit of strategic alternatives in the first three quarters of fiscal million and certain costs incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the contemplated spin off of the medgenesis diagnostics products business million 
when chronimed announced its intention to spin off medgenesis in the third quarter of fiscal  it also announced the discontinuance of its exploration of strategic alternatives 
the company incurred no such related costs in fiscal aside from these items  corporate g a expenses increased  a favorable comparison against a increase in revenue 
mail order segment g a expense grew by  from million to million

the expense growth was in line with revenue growth  as a percentage of revenue  these expenses increased only slightly from to 
the absolute dollar growth of million in the on going business is attributed to the app and oaks acquisitions by the retail segment during fiscal and increasing labor and facility costs in the specialty pharmacy stores

the company has taken steps to ensure timely and accurate reviews of its reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
interest income the increase in interest income from an expense of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal is due primarily to million of interest earned from the invested proceeds from the sale of medgenesis in january   and million of interest earned on a note receivable from express med arising from the sale of hsm 
the medgenesis sale proceeds were later used to fund acquisitions in the third app and fourth quarters oaks and sangstat of fiscal the company expects to return to a net borrowing position as it continues its business growth 
other income loss the million loss in fiscal reflects the company s loss on sale of available for sale securities that had been received as consideration in the sale of the company s medgenesis business

the retail segment grew for the year due to continued growth from new pharmacies and from new patients in existing stores 
cost of revenue total gross profit dollars increased million in fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but declined in fiscal as a percentage of revenue from to 
the gross profit dollar increase came from significant revenue growth in the retail segment 
gross profit as a percent of revenue decreased in both segments in fiscal mail order declines were caused by the high volume contracted pricing program with aetna and on going managed care pricing pressure  most notably in the biotech injectables program 
retail margins also decreased  as the retail market was also negatively affected by the cost containment efforts of managed care providers 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased million  or  in fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of this increase came from four specific charges that were unusual or infrequent in nature  to be discussed below 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  including the specific charges that were unusual or infrequent in nature 
first  a million expense is included in fiscal g a related to the company s strategic planning endeavor  including its engagement with an investment banker

third  g a expenses also include million of costs associated with the disposition of the company s diagnostic products business medgenesis  which was completed in january fourth  concurrent with the company s restatement as described above  management determined that the information on which it had based its previous allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was incorrect

as a percentage of revenue  selling and marketing expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest income the decrease in net interest income from million in fiscal to net interest expense of million in fiscal is due to a decline in interest income from the orphan medical receivable  which was paid in full in fiscal  and to short term borrowings incurred throughout fiscal to finance chronimed s growth 
other income in fiscal the company recognized a pre tax gain of million  recorded as other income in the financial statements  as a result of selling its publishing business to john wiley and sons  a new york publisher  for million 
income taxes the income tax rate changed from a expense on an operating profit in fiscal to a benefit on an operating loss in fiscal due to certain potential non deductible expenses incurred as part of the spin off efforts in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to the company s statutory rate 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had million of working capital  compared to million as of june  during  the company utilized million of cash from operating activities 
the average days sales outstanding dso of the company s accounts receivable improved from days at june  to days at june  faster payment from the company s largest payor  the discontinuance of the disposed businesses  and the higher proportion of retail sales  which generally are paid quickly  led to this improvement  along with the write off of old balances during the fourth quarter as part of the company s extensive review of accounts receivable
