accessory sales were lower in by  due to this decision and due to weaker responses to the holiday catalogs  especially in december additionally  sales from wine futures and delivery income were lower by approximately  and  respectively 
futures decreased primarily due to higher pricing and to lower quality wines from that vintage 
delivery income declined as a result of greater use of free shipping offers in as compared to acquisition sales declined by  as a result of significantly weaker response rates to these mailings 
the company plans to continue testing new lists and creative formats and offers to increase these response rates 
internet sales and catalog sales contributed to the sales increase from to internet sales  excluding shipping revenue  accounted for of geerlings wade s revenues compared to only in membership revenue increased  from  in to  in  or

the average number of cases purchased per customer increased from cases per year in to cases per year in in  the average number of cases purchased per customer decreased to 
in large part  the increase in in the average annual number of cases purchased was a result of fewer sales in to first time buyers  who generally buy less than one case at the time of their first purchase 
all markets that were operating in and except arizona  colorado  michigan and texas reflect sales declines between and between and all markets except new york  virginia and washington reflected sales growth 
sales from memberships were  and of overall revenues in  and  respectively

sales from delivery income were  and in  and  respectively 
the average case price for cases sold by the company increased from in to in  a increase 
average case price decreased in to or below the average price of per case 
the decrease in case price between and is due to lower average prices of about for wines sold to existing customers  attributable primarily to a shift in product mix offered by the company and to more price mark downs for wines offered in the odds ends mailings from to the company does not believe that it will need to lower prices to compete in the market place 
however  this does not preclude price adjustments that may be necessary to track price trends in the marketplace precipitated by market factors such as a drop in the price of wine from suppliers or major changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in  geerlings wade continued discounting selected products to reduce inventory and maintain a manageable number of stock keeping units

during these periods  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in to in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from favorable exchange rates and from improved purchasing by the company in and gross profits for all sales per case of wine sold increased per case during to per case from per case in in  the gross profit per case was there are several factors that cause the company s gross margins to vary 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates influence the cost at which the company is able to buy wine 
in addition  the company sells its more expensive wines at a lower gross margin percentage than its less expensive wines 
consequently  the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales diminishes if the average price point of the company s product mix increases 
nationally branded wines  sold on winebins 
com and geerwade 
com  are sold at gross margins which are significantly lower than the average gross margins for the company s privately sourced wine 
therefore  if the company materially increased the sale of nationally branded wine  its gross margin percentage would be adversely affected 
there are no plans to materially change the mix between privately sourced and nationally branded wines 
selling  general and administrative expenses

from to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from  to  as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses equaled in  in and in selling  general and administrative costs increased in several areas in as compared to the largest contributor to the increase was delivery expense  which rose  this increase was the result of using couriers other than ups for all of in nevada  florida and connecticut and to increasing sales in high cost delivery states such as texas and north carolina 
the company continues to devote considerable efforts in an attempt to lower delivery expenses 
costs are also impacted by the company s need to comply with laws and regulations related to the retail sale of wine 
in  the company operated from licensed facilities in separate states 
operating these separate locations forced the company to incur unusually high overhead expenses as a percentage of sales 
rent expense increased by  in due to the addition of the north carolina retail facility and to increased rents in various states 
in  the company also expensed  related to a severance agreement with jay essa  who resigned as chief executive officer in april other minor increases for overhead and variable costs contributed to the remaining selling  general and administrative expense increase for marketing expenses increased marginally between and marketing expenses  which are referred to as advertising costs in the financial statement footnotes  increased  from  in to  in this increase includes the  additional expense the company recognized as a result of a change in accounting estimate for the amortization of acquisition mailing expenses 
expenses for acquisition mailings were higher by an additional  as a result of mailing more acquisition mail in than in however  response rates to these mailings were lower in and generated fewer sales and new customers than in the increase in acquisition mailing expenses was offset by mailing fewer catalogs  curtailing space and radio advertising for its websites and terminating outbound telemarketing 
marketing costs increased  or  from  in to  in the majority of the increase in marketing expenses resulted from spending approximately  for advertising to promote geerlings wade s internet sites  particularly in connection with the november launch of the winebins 
com site

in  the company mailed to older buyers less frequently but with special offers to encourage repeat purchases 
this practice seeks to maximize the response rates to these mailings while minimizing costs for marketing to these lower performing segments 
additionally  in  the company launched a promotional program for new customers to increase the conversion rates of one time buyers to frequent buyers 
this program entails special mailings and  in  contacts by sales representatives 
response rates to acquisition mailings weakened in due to increased competition from internet and direct mail wine retailers  deeper circulation in which weaker buyers are mailed and rental list fatigue 
the company plans to focus on increasing response rates to acquisition mailings in following the company s decision in the second quarter of to standardize the wines it sells in each state  the company has been able to standardize its customer mailings and save significant per unit printing expenses in however  to manage inventory better by selling previously promoted wines  the company plans to remarket wines promoted on the back page of about one third of its house mailing brochures 
the company expects that this will add to printing costs but facilitate inventory management 
the company anticipates that its marketing expenses in connection with its e commerce sites will be marginally higher in than in the company plans to use its traditional acquisition mailings to acquire new customers in but intends to distribute such mailings to a lower number of prospective customers than it did in the company plans to further develop its catalogs devoted primarily to wine with mailings scheduled for spring and several mailings for the holiday season of in  geerlings wade plans to mail brochures and four odds ends mailings  preferred customer and member mailings  seven region studies and one futures mailing to its customers 
as described above  the company plans throughout the year to mail regular special offers to new customers and customers who have not purchased for some time

under the company s merchandising plan for  the company committed to purchasing large quantities of wine 
the company was unable to sell all this wine at the same turn rate as it had in  which resulted in higher inventories 
in addition  as a result of the alcoholic beverage regulatory framework within which the company operates  the company is required to maintain separate inventories in each of the markets in which it operates a licensed facility and is not permitted to transfer inventory between such facilities 
in the second quarter of  the company opened a licensed facility in greensboro  north carolina 
the inventory for this facility added to the overall inventory levels

based upon the current level of operations  anticipated cost savings and revenue growth  the company believes that cash flow from operations and available cash will be adequate to meet the company s working capital needs for the company s liquidity sources will not be sufficient to permit the company to grow in the manner it would like to unless the company pursues alternative sources of liquidity 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain alternate sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all

risk factors that may affect future results regulation 
the alcoholic beverage industry is subject to extensive specialized regulation under state and federal laws and regulations  including the following matters licensing  the payment of excise taxes  advertising  trade and pricing practices  product labeling  sales to minors and intoxicated persons  changes in officers  directors  ownership or control  and  relationships among product producers  importers  wholesalers and retailers 
while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  in the event that it should be determined that the company is not in compliance with any applicable laws or regulations  the company could become subject to cease and desist orders  injunctive proceedings  civil fines  license revocations and other penalties which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
in addition  the alcoholic beverage industry is subject to potential legislation and regulation on a continuous basis including in such areas as direct and internet sales of alcohol 
there can be no assurance that new or revised laws or regulations  increased licensing fees  specialized taxes or other regulatory requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
while to date the company has been able to obtain and retain licenses necessary to sell wine at retail  the failure to obtain renewals or otherwise retain such licenses in one or more of the states in which the company operates would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
the company s growth strategy includes expansion of its business into additional states  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining licenses in any additional states 
in addition  geerlings wade offers its customers the opportunity to purchase one and three year memberships 
this membership program has from time to time generated regulatory scrutiny  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue its membership program in its current form in existing markets or that markets in which the company may become licensed in the future will allow the sale of memberships  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
limited operating history  management of growth

although the company was profitable in and  the company was not profitable in   and and there can be no assurance that it will operate profitably in the future 
in addition  the company has only limited management  operational and financial resources to accommodate continued growth  should it occur 
the company s ability to manage growth effectively will require it to continue to implement and improve its operational and financial systems and to hire and train new employees 
these demands are expected to require additional management resources and the development of additional expertise by existing management 
the failure to manage growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that geerlings wade will be able successfully to attract and retain the skilled and experienced personnel required to manage its business 
liquidity 
the company s current liquidity sources are not sufficient to permit the company to grow in a manner that would be most advantageous for stockholders 
the company intends to pursue alternative sources of liquidity  but there can be no assurance that the company will obtain alternate sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
effectiveness and cost of mailings  cost of paper 
the company targets potential new customers and solicits orders from existing customers through direct mail marketing campaigns 
direct mail marketing campaigns are capital intensive and the cost effectiveness of such campaigns depends  to a large extent  upon the accuracy of assumptions and judgments made by the company 
there can be no assurance that such direct marketing campaigns will be completed on a cost effective basis 
the failure of any such marketing campaign to identify new customers or to generate new purchases from existing customers on a cost effective basis may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
increases in the cost of paper or printing could have a negative impact on the company s business and results of operations to the extent that the company is unable to pass on such increases directly to customers 
the company relies on the services of outside vendors to prepare and distribute its mailings in accordance with company specifications and schedules 
the failure of such outside vendors to perform such services according to company specifications or to adhere to company mailing schedules may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
increases in postage rates  dependence on shippers 
the company s marketing efforts have traditionally been conducted through direct mail campaigns 
as a result  increases in postage rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
except in massachusetts and new jersey  the company is dependent upon delivery services provided by ups or other licensed delivery companies 
a work stoppage  strike or other interruption in service experienced by ups or other delivery companies  such as the ups driver strike in  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
additionally  increases in shipping rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations

dependence on wine selection and sourcing 
to a large extent  the company s success depends upon its wine selection and sourcing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consistently develop a selection of wines that will enable the company to maintain or expand its customer base 
many of the company s wines are sourced by mr 
peter van hoof  one of the company s primary negociants for europe  and mr 
guy davis  one of the company s primary negociants for the us the loss of services of either of these parties could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations 
in the event that a wine proves to be unpopular for any reason or the company orders an excessive quantity of one or more wines  it may encounter liquidity problems under these circumstances  which may have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations 
dependence on consumer spending  geographic concentration of customers 
the success of geerlings wade depends upon a number of factors related to the level of consumer spending  including the general state of the economy  federal and state tax rates and consumer confidence 
changes in consumer spending in both the national and regional economies can affect both the quantity and the price of wines that consumers are willing to purchase 
competition  changes in consumer tastes 
the company competes with a broad range of wine specialty stores  retail liquor stores  online wine retailers  other direct mail wine merchants and certain supermarket stores  many of which may have significantly greater resources than the company 
additionally  the company s wines compete with other alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully compete with its current or future competition 
although consumption of premium wines in the united states has increased  there can be no assurance that changes in consumer preferences or tastes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
health issues 
since  federal law has required health warning labels on all alcoholic beverages 
although an increasing number of research studies suggest that health benefits may result from the moderate consumption of wine  these suggestions have been widely challenged and a number of groups advocate increased governmental action to restrict consumption of alcoholic beverages 
restrictions on the sale and consumption of wine or increases in the taxes imposed on wine in response to concerns regarding health issues may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
there can be no assurance that there will not be legal or regulatory challenges to the industry as a whole  and any such legal or regulatory challenge may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
exchange rates  currency fluctuations 
the company sources many of its wines from certain european countries and australia and makes payment for such purchases in local currencies 
from time to time  the company engages in currency hedging activities related to firm commitments for the purchase of inventories in an effort to fix costs and manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in exchange rates or currency fluctuations that disfavor the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
excise taxes  customs duties and tariffs 
the federal government and various states impose excise taxes  duties and tariffs on wine 
increases in the federal excise tax on wine or increases in state excise tax levels may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and its results of operations 
in  approximately of the total cases of wine sold by the company were imported 
increases in duty or tariff levels may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
agricultural conditions  grape supply 
winemaking and grape growing are subject to a variety of agricultural risks 
various diseases and pests  drought  frosts and certain other weather conditions may have a material adverse effect on the quality and quantity of grapes available to producers  thereby having a material adverse effect on the cost of domestic or imported wines available to the company and on the prices of wine established by the company s competition 
dependence on computers 
the company relies on software  hardware  the internet and telecommunications equipment and services to transact  process  record  keep  analyze and manage all aspects of its business 
in the event any of these major components or services fail for an extended period of time  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  sales and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations on vendor accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies

the gains and losses on these contracts are included in earnings when the underlying foreign currency denominated transaction is recognized 
the company realized  in gain related to these contracts in losses related to these instruments for fiscal were not material to the company 
looking forward  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
however  there can be no assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately
