forward looking statements include information concerning our future financial condition and business strategy 
statements that contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  prospects  estimates  should  may or similar expressions are forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
while we believe these expectations and projections are reasonable  forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us 
the following discussion of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this report 
overview in connection with the transactions  pca acquired the containerboard group of pactiv corporation  formerly known as tenneco packaging inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tenneco inc  which consisted of its containerboard and corrugated products business and which we refer to in this report as the group 
from its formation in january and through the closing of the acquisition on april   pca did not have any significant operations 
accordingly  the historical financial results for periods prior to april  described below are those of the group 
the group operated prior to april  as a division of pactiv  and not as a separate  stand alone entity 
as a result  the historical financial information included in this report does not necessarily reflect what the group s financial position and results of operations would have been had the group been operated as a separate  stand alone entity during the periods prior to april  the acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed assets 
purchase accounting was not applied because  under the applicable accounting guidance  a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a result of the participating veto rights held by pactiv after the closing of the transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the transactions 
general historically  prices for containerboard have reflected changes in containerboard supply that result from capacity additions and reductions  as well as changes in demand 
containerboard demand is dependent upon both domestic demand for corrugated products and linerboard export activity 
according to pulp paper week  after giving effect to price increases in  average prices in december for linerboard and corrugating medium were and higher  respectively  than december prices 
pulp paper week  in its january  publication  reported that prices for linerboard and corrugating medium decreased per ton  or  and per ton  or  respectively  compared to december levels 
the march  pulp paper week publication reported that prices remained unchanged from january levels

year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  net sales net sales increased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the pro forma year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard to third parties 
corrugated products volume was essentially flat in compared to record volume in of billion square feet 
containerboard volume to external domestic and export customers increased to  tons for the year ended december  from  tons in the comparable period of according to pulp paper week  average industry linerboard and semi chemical medium prices for lb

gross profit increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the pro forma year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from of sales in to of sales in the current year primarily due to the sales price increases described above 
corporate overhead for the year ended december   decreased by million  or  from the pro forma year ended december  the reduction primarily reflects the difference in cost between the overhead charged to the group by tenneco and pactiv and overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended december  included three and one half months of corporate overhead  through april   charged by tenneco and pactiv and eight and one half months of corporate overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased salary and other general selling related expenses 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable pro forma period in  primarily due to voluntary prepayments pca made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
pca s effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the pro forma year ended december  the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
pro forma year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased by million  or  for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was the result of increased sales volume of both corrugated products and containerboard and the increased sales prices of corrugated products and outside sales of containerboard

the increase was the result of increased sales volume of both corrugated products and containerboard  the increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard to third parties and reduced corporate overhead expenses 
gross profit increased million  or for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from of sales in to of sales in primarily due to the sales price and volume increases described above 
corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended december   decreased by million  or from the comparable period in the reduction primarily reflects the difference in cost between the overhead charged to the group by tenneco and pactiv and overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
corporate overhead for the pro forma year ended december  included three and one half months of corporate overhead  through april   charged by tenneco and pactiv and eight and one half months of corporate overhead expenses incurred by pca as a stand alone entity 
corporate overhead for the comparable period in consisted exclusively of corporate overhead charged by tenneco and pactiv 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of year remediation expenses yk 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense increased by million  or  for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily due to borrowings under the senior credit facility and the issuance of million of the senior subordinated notes 
this indebtedness was incurred to finance the transactions 
pca s effective tax rate was for the pro forma year ended december  and for the comparable period in the tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the transactions as a division of pactiv  the group did not maintain separate cash accounts other than for petty cash 
the group s disbursements for payroll  capital projects  operating supplies and expenses were processed and funded by pactiv through centrally managed accounts 
in addition  cash receipts from the collection of accounts receivable and the sales of assets were remitted directly to bank accounts controlled by pactiv 
because of pactiv s centrally managed cash system  in which the cash receipts and disbursements of pactiv s various divisions were commingled  it was not feasible to segregate cash received from pactiv  such as financing for the business  from cash transmitted to pactiv  such as a distribution 
accordingly  the net effect of these cash transactions with pactiv is represented as a single line item within the financing section of the statement of cash flows 
similarly  the activity of the interdivision account presents the net transfer of funds and charges between pactiv and the group as a single line item 
since april   pca has maintained its own cash accounts 
operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities increased million  or  for the year ended december  from the comparable pro forma period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income 
cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million  or  from to the increase was primarily due to the replacement of leased assets with owned  depreciable assets in connection with the april  transactions 
investing activities cash used for investing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and a reduction in proceeds from timberland sales 
net cash used for investing activities decreased million  or  for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in  primarily attributable to a prepaid lease payment made in december to acquire timberland as part of a lease buy out and timberlands sale proceeds received in the fourth quarter of as of december   pca had commitments for capital expenditures of million 
pca believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments 
financing activities cash used for financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december   primarily reflecting increased voluntary prepayments made by pca on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
cash used for financing activities increased million  or  for the pro forma year ended december  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the voluntary prepayments pca has made on its term loans under the senior credit facility 
after the transactions following the transactions  pca s primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under pca s new revolving credit facility 
pca s primary uses of cash are for debt service and capital expenditures 
pca expects to be able to fund its debt service and capital expenditures from these sources 
pca incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the transactions 
on april   pca had approximately  million of indebtedness outstanding which included  million of senior secured bank debt  million of subordinated notes and million of preferred stock 
concurrently with the transactions  pca issued the notes and preferred stock and entered into the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility initially provided for three term loans in an aggregate amount of  million and a revolving credit facility with up to million in availability 
upon the closing of the acquisition  pca borrowed the full amount available under the term loans and million under the senior revolving credit facility  the latter of which was repaid immediately thereafter 
in october and november  pca completed the sales of approximately  acres of timberland 
total proceeds received from the sales were million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
effective december   pca elected to reduce its availability under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
on june   pca completed the refinancing of its million senior credit facility 
on january   pca became a publicly traded company with an initial public offering of its common stock 
on march   pca used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem all of its outstanding shares of senior exchangeable preferred stock due on november   pca completed the sale of approximately  acres of timberland to southern timber venture  llc 
the company received million in cash and a equity ownership interest in southern timber venture  llc 
pca recorded a pre tax gain of million  and a portion of the gain was not recognized as a result of pca s continuing ownership interest 
the following table provides the weighted average interest rate as of december  for each of the term loans and the revolving credit facility weighted average borrowing arrangement interest rate term loan a term loan b senior revolving credit facility revolver eurodollar n a revolver base rate n a three year revolving credit facility the borrowings under the senior revolving credit facility are available to fund pca s working capital requirements  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
the term loan a must be repaid in quarterly installments from december through the term loan b must be repaid in quarterly installments from december through the senior revolving credit facility will terminate in the three year revolving credit facility will terminate in in and  pca made voluntary prepayments totaling approximately million and million  respectively  using free cash flow from operations of million and proceeds from the sales of timberland of million to permanently reduce its borrowings under the term loans 
the instruments governing pca s indebtedness and the preferred stock contain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  the ability of pca and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  incur liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of pca 
these limitations could limit corporate and operating activities 
pca estimates that it will make approximately million in capital expenditures in these expenditures will be used primarily for cost reduction  business growth  and environmental compliance 
pca believes that cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the next months  and that cash generated from operations and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
pca s future operating performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service  extend or refinance the senior credit facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond pca s control 
environmental matters we are subject to  and must comply with  a variety of federal  state and local environmental laws  particularly those relating to air and water quality  waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater 
because environmental regulations are constantly evolving  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  costs to maintain compliance with those laws 
in particular  the epa recently finalized the cluster rules which govern pulp and paper mill operations  including those at the counce  filer city  valdosta and tomahawk mills 
over the next several years  the cluster rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants  and require us to spend money to ensure compliance with those new rules 
as is the case with any industrial operation  we have  in the past  incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination  as required by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as the federal superfund law  and analogous state laws 
cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties we currently own or operate  former facilities and off site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances 
because liability under these laws is strict  meaning that liability is imposed without fault  joint and several  meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution  and retroactive  we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material 
under the terms of the contribution agreement  pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre closing off site waste disposal 
pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property in filer city  michigan unrelated to current mill operations 
because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict  meaning that liability is imposed without fault  joint and several  meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution  and retroactive  we could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material 
from january through december  remediation costs at our mills and converting plants totaled about million 
as of december   we maintained a reserve of million for environmental remediation liability as well as a general overall environmental reserve of million  which includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as on going and anticipated remedial projects 
total capital costs for environmental matters  including cluster rule compliance  were million for and we currently estimate that they will be million for  of which million is for to cluster rule requirements 
impact of inflation pca does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations during the past three years 
new accounting standards for a description of changes in accounting principles affecting pca  see note to pca s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  pca has not had any material market risk due to the fact that its debt financing and risk management activities were conducted by pactiv or tenneco 
as a result of the transactions  pca is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
pca periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
under the terms of the senior credit agreement dated as of april   pca was required to maintain for at least two years after the closing of the transactions interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum interest rate with respect to at least of the outstanding term loans under the senior credit agreement 
upon the refinancing of the senior credit agreement on june   this requirement was deleted 
pca currently has interest rate collar agreements that protect against rising interest rates and simultaneously guarantee a minimum interest rate 
the original notional amount of these collar agreements was million 
as pca has made debt prepayments  the need for these collar agreements has diminished 
accordingly  pca has reduced the notional amount of the collars to million as of december  the weighted average floor of the interest rate collar agreements is and the weighted average ceiling of the interest rate collar agreements is 
the interest rate on approximately of pca s variable rate debt at december  is capped 
pca receives payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate libor or commercial paper exceeds the ceiling 
correspondingly  pca makes payments under the collar agreements if the applicable interest rate drops below the floor 
in both cases  the amounts received or paid are based upon the notional amount and the difference between the actual interest rate and the ceiling or floor rate 
the weighted average duration of the interest rate collar agreements is approximately two and one quarter years 
pca s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its variable rate debt instruments 
if interest rates libor or commercial paper for these borrowings increase one percent  pca s interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease  by approximately million and million annually as of december  and  respectively  until the applicable interest rate exceeds the ceiling rate 
at that point  only and of the variable rate debt as of december  and  respectively  would result in additional interest expense 
as of december   the weighted average libor rate was and the weighted average commercial paper rate was 
as of december   the interest rate on the term loans was based on a weighted average libor rate of 
the effect of an interest rate change to the fair market value of the outstanding debt is insignificant 
this analysis does not consider any other impact on fair value that could exist in such an interest rate environment 
in the event of a change in interest rates  management could take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in pca s financial structure
