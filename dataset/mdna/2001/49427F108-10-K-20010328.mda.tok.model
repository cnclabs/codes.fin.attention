overview and background the company  which owns  develops  operates  and acquires office and industrial real estate  primarily in southern california  commenced operations upon the completion of its initial public offering in january and operates as a self administered reit 
the company owns its interests in all of its properties through the operating partnership and the finance partnership and conducts substantially all of its operations through the operating partnership 
the company owned an and general partnership interest in the operating partnership as of december  and  respectively 
the finance partnership is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from rental income  including tenant reimbursements 
the company s revenue growth in was due primarily to operating results from million of development projects completed and added to the company s portfolio of stabilized properties in and and was also due to a increase in net operating income from the company s core portfolio 
the company defines its core portfolio as stabilized properties owned at january  and still owned at december  management believes that the most significant part of the company s revenue growth within the next two to three years will come from its substantial development pipeline of approximately million rentable square feet of office space to be developed over the next three to four years 
management also believes that continued success of the real estate market in the company s principal markets will result in strong demand for office and industrial space 
consequently  management currently expects that the company s revenue in the next one to two years will also grow as a result of re leasing  at generally higher lease rates  approximately million square feet of office space and million square feet of industrial space currently subject to leases expiring during the next two years 
factors which may affect future results of operations as of the total net rentable square footage of the company s stabilized portfolio is located in california  the company s operating results are and will continue to be affected by uncertainties and problems associated with the deregulation of the electric industry in california 
such deregulation has resulted in higher utility costs in some areas of the state and intermittent service interruptions 
as of the date of this report  the company has not experienced any material trends or effects arising from this regional issue 
approximately based on net rentable square footage of the company s current leases require tenants to pay utility costs directly  therefore  eliminating the company s exposure 
the remaining of the company s leases provide that the tenants reimburse the company for utility costs in excess of a base year amount

the company considers funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  funds from operations should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as clarified by the november nareit national policy bulletin which became effective on january   which may differ from the methodologies used by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to funds from operations published by such other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the properties financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the properties liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the properties cash needs  including the company s ability to pay dividends or make distributions
