overview deltek is a leading provider of enterprise software products that enable project oriented organizations and professional service firms to more effectively manage  operate and grow their operations 
from through  without considering revenues from the company s acquisition of harper and shuman  substantially all of the company s revenues were derived from licenses of its system business software  designed primarily for organizations providing products or services under contracts with the federal government  and services related to system in  the company began development of deltek costpoint  an advanced client server based  enterprise wide business software system  which was commercially released in june and which represented approximately of the company s license fees for the year ended december  the primary software product suites that we currently market consist of deltek crm and deltek proposals  a front office customer relationship management solution for professional service environments  deltek costpoint  an advanced client server based business software system designed for all types of complex project oriented organizations  deltek advantage  an integrated  project focused accounting system designed for professional services firms  deltek gcs premier  project accounting software for small to mid sized organizations providing products or services under contracts with the federal government  and deltek time collection formerly et enterprise  an advanced employee timekeeping system 
the company s revenues consist of fees derived from the licensing of its software products  service revenues from consulting and other services  and revenues from the resale of third party equipment and the sublicensing of third party software 
the company generally recognizes license fees from its products upon delivery 
for certain of its software products  the company had typically granted its customers a right of return for any reason for a full or partial refund of the license fee during a refund period  which is generally to days from the date of the initial software delivery 
beginning with the third quarter of  the company modified the refund provision for new contracts to be for a material defect only within the to day timeframe 
this had the effect of allowing the company to immediately recognize revenue since it believes it has no material defects in its generally released products 
prior to this change  revenue had been deferred for the stated refund period of the contract 
due to the decline in deltek costpoint sales  the impact on revenue was not significant for the company occasionally has provided  and may in the future provide  longer refund periods for larger  more complex deltek costpoint installations 
implementation and other consulting services are provided on a time and materials basis  billed monthly and recognized as the services are performed 
ongoing support services are provided for fees that are payable in quarterly or annual installments and initially represent between and of the related software license fee on an annual basis 
revenues 
table of contents from ongoing support services are recognized over the quarter or annual period in which the services are provided 
training is billed by the hour or per class and recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from third party equipment and software are derived from the resale and sublicensing of third party hardware and software products in connection with the license and installation of the company s systems and are generally recognized on delivery 
the company derives substantially greater profit margins from license fees than from service revenues or third party equipment and software revenues 
the mix of revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and such fluctuations can have a material effect on margins 
over the past five years  the percentage of the company s total revenues represented by service revenues has increased  and the company anticipates that it will continue to do so 
in april  deltek acquired substantially all assets of a e management services  inc  including its complete suite of rfp proposal automation and tracking software  for the cash purchase price of million 
net assets acquired were nominal and the entire purchase price was allocated to purchased intangibles and goodwill on a preliminary basis 
these intangibles are being amortized over five years 
a e management s rfp front office automation solution is designed to help the architecture  engineering  construction  and other professional services organizations win more contracts by automating the process of collecting  updating  researching and retrieving data critical to achieving marketing and proposal automation success 
in august  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of semaphore  inc for a purchase price of approximately million in cash subject to certain working capital adjustments and million of non cash considerations 
semaphore  inc provides advanced financial and project management software and services for architecture  engineering  construction  and other professional services firms 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased intangibles and goodwill on a preliminary basis 
these intangibles and goodwill are being amortized over five years 
see notes to consolidated financial statements regarding pro forma information that might have been achieved if these transactions had been in effect since the beginning of in april  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of saleskit and assumed certain related liabilities 
the purchase price consisted of million of cash in addition to three year warrants with an estimated fair value of  the warrants are exercisable for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset purchase 
the company assigned million of the saleskit purchase price to in process research and development based upon an independent appraisal and expensed this amount in in the opinion of management  the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
in may  the company completed its acquisition of harper and shuman by exchanging approximately  shares of its common stock for all of the common stock of harper and shuman 
the acquisition constituted a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all prior period consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of harper and shuman as though it had always been a part of deltek

interest income 
interest income results from investment and  to a lesser extent  from installment financing 
interest income for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the same period in this increase is due to better returns on marketable securities 
income tax provision 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  as compared to the pro forma effective tax rate of for the same period in the tax rate for the year ended december  was affected by the nondeductible nature of a majority of the transaction costs for the acquisition of harper and shuman 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations almost exclusively from cash flow from its operations 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million 
for the year ended december   the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million 
accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  were million as of december   compared to million as of december  accounts receivable days sales outstanding were days as of december   compared to days as of december  investing activities utilized million for the year ended december  this amount included million in sold marketable securities  million in purchased property and equipment and million of capitalized software production costs 
acquisitions for the year utilized an additional million 
financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  from the issuance of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
this was offset by million of common stock purchased and retired 
the company believes that its current liquidity  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy the company s anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the foreseeable future 
however  depending on its rate of growth  profitability and other factors  some of which are not in the company s control  the company believes additional financing may be required to meet its working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs  including acquisitions  in the future 
the company may consider additional appropriate acquisitions should such opportunities present themselves 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  that any such financing will be on terms satisfactory to the company 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we may continue to experience a downturn in sales from several of our core back office software products due to our inability to move their related technologies to a completely web based architecture 
to maintain our competitive position  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
it directors of many companies now believe that all of their enterprise software applications should be deployable over the web 
other than employee time collection and the business intelligence reporting tools components of deltek costpoint  many of our software applications cannot be operated over the internet without the use of remote control software technology 
it may take several years to rebuild many of these application products in technologies that will fully support web based  thin client architecture 
the company s inability to port to or run on new or increasingly popular operating systems  or the company s failure to successfully enhance and improve its products in a timely manner  and position and or price its products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
future revenue growth is dependent in part on our successful introduction of our new psa application suite 
the company s new psa application suite development effort began during third quarter of year and is directly targeted at the emerging market for psa applications 
our new psa system is intended to automate accounting  billing  employee time and expense  crm  proposals  resource planning and scheduling  human resources  knowledge management  and project e business 
deltek plans to deliver early releases of this new application suite later this year 
growth from software sales is dependent  in part  on our ability to successfully launch this and additional new products and our ability to retain and hire sales personnel 
see business products 
adverse economic conditions may result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth 
the revenue growth and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services  particularly in the product segments in which we compete 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate and government customers  our business also depends on general economic and business conditions 

table of contents a softening of demand for computer software caused by a weakening of the economy may result in decreased revenues or lower revenue growth rates 
in particular  one of the challenges the company continues to face in promoting future growth in license revenues is the successful refocusing of its marketing and sales efforts to the psa area of its applications business 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively promote future revenue growth in its systems software and business applications areas 
we may not be able to overcome loss of growth previously attributable to businesses that purchased software in order make their systems yk compliant 
management believes that the growth in demand for our products in prior years was due in part to our customers needs to update their it systems in preparation for the year our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to overcome such loss of growth through development and sale of our new products 
several factors may require the company to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement 
these factors include whether the license agreement relates partially or entirely to then unavailable software products  whether enterprise transactions include both currently deliverable software products and software products that are under development or other undeliverable elements  whether the customer demands services that include significant modifications  customizations or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance  whether the transaction involves acceptance criteria that may preclude revenue recognition or if there are identified product related issues  such as known defects  and whether the transaction involves payment terms or fees that depend upon contingencies 
because of the factors listed above and other specific requirements under gaap for software revenue recognition  the company must have very precise terms in its license agreements in order to recognize revenue when it initially delivers software or performs services 
although the company has a standard form of license agreement that meets the criteria under gaap for current revenue recognition on delivered elements  it negotiates and revises these terms and conditions in some transactions 
negotiation of mutual acceptance terms and conditions can extend the sales cycle  and sometimes we do not obtain terms and conditions that permit revenue recognition at the time of delivery or event as work on the project is completed 
recent accounting pronouncements could adversely impact our profitability by delaying some revenue recognition into future periods 
over the past several years  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position or sop  software revenue recognition sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters primarily from a conceptual level and do not include specific implementation guidance 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance with sops  and sop the company adopted sop on january  and has changed certain business policies to meet the requirements of this sop 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab which explains how the sec staff believes existing revenue recognition rules should be applied or analogized to for transactions not addressed by existing rules 
in addition  in october  the sec staff issued a frequently asked questions and answers faq document  which further elaborates on the sec staff s views regarding issues addressed in sab the company was required to and adopted the provisions of sab in its fourth quarter of and believes that adopting sab will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
the accounting profession continues to discuss certain provisions of sop no 
and sab with the objective of providing additional guidance on potential interpretations 
these discussions and the issuance of 
table of contents implementation guidelines and interpretations  once finalized  could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  which could cause us to recognize lower revenues 
as a result  we may change our business practices significantly in order to continue to recognize a substantial portion of our license revenues 
these changes may reduce demand  extend sales cycles  increase administrative costs and otherwise adversely affect the company 
we may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results that may adversely impact the price of our stock 
our operating results for any quarter are subject to significant variation depending upon a number of factors including the following the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  demand for our products  the size and timing of specific sales  the delay or deferral of customer implementations  the level of product and price competition that we encounter  the length of our sales cycles  our ability to attract and retain personnel  the timing of new hires  the timing of our new product introductions and product enhancements and of our competitors  the mix of products and services we sell  the activities of and acquisitions by our competitors  the timing of our international user conference  general economic conditions  our ability to develop and market new software products and enhancements  our ability to control costs  and our ability to collect receivables 
our future quarterly operating results from time to time may not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
our operating results  particularly our quarterly results  could be significantly affected by the loss or delay of individual orders as well as changes in revenue recognition rules 
our revenues from license fees are difficult to predict because of the length and variability of our sales cycles typically three to months 
our operating expenses  on the other hand  are based on anticipated revenue trends 
a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed 
to the extent we incur expenses before obtaining anticipated revenues  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to accurately forecast timing of sales  which may adversely affect our business 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  such as the date when they estimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
management aggregates these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline 
management compares the pipeline at various points in time to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis may provide some guidance to management in business planning and budgeting  these pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts or in the pipeline itself could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business or results of operations 

table of contents internet enabled products present unique risks 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
we may not be able to effectively compete in the internet related products and services market 
in addition  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  demand  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation  remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we compete with a number of companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
as our larger competitors  such as oracle  peoplesoft and sap  begin to experience a deceleration in their core business and refocus their marketing and sales efforts to the middle market in which we actively markets our products  we expect such competitors to implement increasingly aggressive pricing programs 
in addition  certain competitors such as oracle  peoplesoft  sap and siebel  have well established relationships with our current and prospective customers and with major accounting and consulting firms that may have an incentive to recommend such competitors over us 
we also face indirect competition from the internal mis departments of our potential customers 
in the front office systems market we face competition from customer s internal information technology departments  systems integrators  as well as from other application software providers such as siebel and goldmine  which offer a variety of products and services to address this market 
many of our customers and potential customers have attempted to develop front office systems in house  either alone or with the help of systems integrators 
we may not be able to compete successfully in this market 
there can be no assurance that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing or new competitors 
in addition  increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see business competition 
our future success is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees 
our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  research and development  consulting  customer service  sales and marketing personnel 
although we currently are investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to expand our direct sales force and our technical and customer support staff  we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
we could be adversely affected if we are unable to recruit qualified personnel or if senior managers or other such personnel were to leave our employ and qualified replacements were not available 
competition for skilled personnel in the software industry is intense  particularly in the washington dc metro area 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain the personnel we require to develop and market new and enhanced products or to market and service its existing products and conduct our operations successfully 
any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may incur increased compensation costs in order to attract and retain skilled employees 
our success will also depend in part on the continued services of our key employees  particularly our senior management personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees and do not maintain any key person life insurance 
the resignation or loss of kenneth e 
delaski  the company s president and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face risks associated with new product development  rapid technology change  and potential liability 
the business application software market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
our future success will depend  to a substantial degree  upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and emerging and evolving industry standards 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing the development of new products and enhancements or that any new product or enhancement it may introduce will achieve market acceptance 

table of contents the development of new  technologically advanced software products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from or integration with older products in order to minimize disruption in sales of existing products 
there can be no assurance that our development efforts will progress satisfactorily or keep pace with industry developments 
we allocate resources for research and development projects based on planned product introductions and enhancements  however  actual expenditures may significantly differ from amounts allocated 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  delays in the introduction of our products  due to factors internal and external to us 
additionally  because our software products are complex  there can be no assurance that  despite testing  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
the sale and support of our software products entails the risk of product liability claims 
in addition  the failure to perform services to a customer s expectations may result in our not being paid for services rendered  may damage our reputation and may result in a claim being brought against us 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance  however  a successful claim for product or service liability brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
see business products and product development 
we may be subject to risks from acquisition activities 
as part of our growth strategy  we have acquired or invested in  and from time to time may acquire or invest in  complementary businesses  technologies and product lines 
in order to successfully integrate acquired products into our sales and marketing channels  we must train our sales force on acquired products and integrate employees of the acquired companies with respect to sales commission  territories  product positioning and training 
in addition  certain of such acquired assets  licenses or technology may require significant additional development  such as the completion of product functionality  before the commercial release of products 
additional risks from acquisitions include disruption of our ongoing business  diversion of management from day to day operations  amortization of acquired intangible assets  impairment of relationships with customers  employees and strategic partners  loss of personnel  difficulty of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and potential liabilities arising from any acquisition 
our inability to address such risks or fulfill expectations regarding revenues from acquired businesses  products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our continued success depends upon our ability to manage growth 
we are currently experiencing growth through acquisitions  which have placed  and will continue to place  a strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources and demands on our systems and controls 
this growth has resulted in an increasing level of responsibility for our management personnel 
our ability to manage our growth successfully will also require us to continue to expand and improve our operational  management and financial systems and controls on a timely basis 
if our management is unable to manage growth effectively  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we face the uncertainty of expansion into new markets 
we believe that our future success is dependent  in part  on our ability to successfully penetrate the professional service automation market  to adapt our product development and marketing strategies to meet the developing needs of our marketplace  and to expand internationally 
although we have an ongoing program to further customize and add functionality to our products in order to address the specific needs of customers in new markets  our limited resources may restrict our ability to track developments in these markets  to develop appropriate products  and to effectively pursue product development and marketing activities and strategies in multiple markets simultaneously 
there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in new markets 
our inability to successfully expand the markets for our products or develop marketing strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are partially dependent upon organizations with federal government contracts 
a significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers that provide products and services under federal government contracts 
we believe that  at least in the near term  such organizations will continue to represent a large percentage of our customers and account for a significant percentage of our total revenues 
while such organizations are subject to the same general economic conditions as other businesses  demand for their 
table of contents products and services is also dependent upon applicable procurement policies and the availability of appropriated funds 
any significant downsizing  consolidation or liquidation of such organizations as a result of changes in procurement policies  budget reductions or reallocations or other causes could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we continue to rely on third party software development tools 
we license from third parties certain software development tools that we utilize in the development of our products 
accordingly  we are dependent upon such third parties abilities to deliver quality products  correct errors  support their current products  develop new and enhanced products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
should these third party development tools become unavailable  or should their developers fail to adequately support or enhance them  we would be required to establish relationships with alternative third party providers and to rewrite our products using different development tools 
although we believe that other development tools with comparable functionality are currently available from other third parties  there can be no assurance that  if needed  replacement products could be obtained on reasonable terms 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we could successfully rewrite our products using different development tools or that it would not encounter substantial delays in doing so 
our inability to rewrite our products using different development tools on a timely and cost effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights and be subject to risks of infringement 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its our proprietary software 
we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our rights in our software 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy  design around or reverse engineer aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
furthermore  we have no patents  and existing copyright law affords only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our proprietary software against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
there are currently no claims pending against us relating to the infringement of any proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance  however  that third parties will not claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources from day to day operations or cause delays in the delivery or implementation of our products 
in addition  such claims could require us to discontinue the use of certain software codes or processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  and develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the alleged infringing technology 
there can be no assurance we would be able to develop alternative technologies or to obtain such licenses or  if a license were obtainable  that the terms would be commercially acceptable to us 
in the event of a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our principal shareholders have the ability to exercise control 
our principal shareholders  kenneth e 
delaski  our chairman  president  and chief executive officer  and donald delaski  director  together with their affiliates  in the aggregate own approximately of the outstanding shares of the common stock as of march  as a result  these shareholders  acting together  are able to effectively control substantially all matters requiring approval by our shareholders including the election of the board of directors and significant corporate transactions 
such influence by such shareholders could delay or prevent a change in control  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

table of contents a substantial number of our shares are eligible for resale  which could adversely affect the market price 
substantially all of our restricted securities are available for resale pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended the securities act including the shares owned by the principal shareholders 
in october  pursuant to contractual obligations to do so  we registered an aggregate of  shares of common stock and  shares of common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding warrants under the securities act 
sales of substantial amounts of such restricted or registered securities could adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
the market price of our common stock is volatile which could materially impact your investment 
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile 
we believe factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements of new products and acquisitions by us or by our competitors  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  changes in accounting treatments or principles and other factors may cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
the market price of our common stock also may be affected by our ability to estimate our pipeline  or to meet market analysts expectations  and any failure to meet such expectations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  securities prices for many technology companies fluctuate widely for reasons  which may be unrelated to operating results of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  class action litigation has often been instituted against such company 
any such litigation instigated against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources from day to day operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition
