item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview simon transportation provides nationwide  predominantly temperature controlled truckload transportation for numerous major shippers 
in recent years  much of the company s growth has resulted from earning core carrier status with major shippers and meeting the demands of these shippers for additional equipment 
the company has grown to million in revenue for its fiscal year ended september   from million in revenue for fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of 
during fiscal  the company experienced strong revenue growth  with revenue increasing approximately 
pretax earnings decreased substantially  however  as the company experienced financial and operating difficulties 
for much of the year  the industry wide driver shortage contributed to a substantial number of unseated tractors 
to address this problem  the company raised driver wages by a total of four cents per mile 
although management believes the higher wages made the company more competitive in attracting and retaining drivers  the combination of unproductive equipment and higher wages adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company s financial results also were affected by unusually high accident claims and repair expense during the second fiscal quarter 
during fiscal year  management deferred deliveries of new tractors to better match the anticipated availability of drivers 
this reduced revenue growth for the year to compared with historical levels 
the company continued to experience financial and operating difficulties due to driver turnover rates far in excess of historical averages and the fact that driver pay increases effective in fiscal were not offset by increases in the freight rates charged by the company 
in july  the company reduced its shop and administrative personnel by approximately 
during fiscal year  revenue growth was 
despite this growth  the company struggled to restore profitability because of high fuel prices  and increased driver turnover 
accident claims  repair expenses  recruiting costs  and low miles per tractor hurt the company s profitability and were exacerbated by the highest turnover in simon s history 
during fiscal year  in connection with the change in controlling ownership and management  the company changed its method of accounting for its accrual for accident and workers compensation claims 
effective october   the company adopted a fully developed claims expense estimate based on an actuarial computation of the ultimate liability 
both the method formerly used by the company and the fully developed method are acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was million  net of an income tax benefit of million 
the company operated as an s corporation from october  to november  as a result  the company s net taxable earnings were taxed directly to the company s existing stockholders rather than to the company 
the pro forma statement of earnings data included in the selected financial and operating data set forth the company s net earnings for such periods as if the company had been subject to federal and state income taxes at a combined effective rate of for fiscal year in addition to the ongoing income tax effect  the termination of the company s s corporation status resulted in a one time  non cash charge of approximately million during fiscal year in recognition of deferred income taxes

at september   the company had other outstanding long term debt and capitalized lease obligations including current portions of approximately million  most of which comprised obligations for the purchase of revenue equipment 
as of september   the company s future commitments under noncancelable operating leases amounted to million 
in january  the company amended its credit facility 
the amended agreement provides for a million term loan in addition to the million line of credit 
the term loan matures september  and the line of credit matures september  borrowings under the line of credit and term loan are secured by the company s salt lake city terminal facility 
in addition  a portion of borrowings under the agreement are guaranteed by the company s majority stockholder

seasonality the company experiences some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume  as shipments have historically decreased during the first calendar quarter 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
forward looking statements 
fuel availability and cost the company actively manages its fuel costs by requiring drivers to fuel at company terminals or  whenever possible en route  at service centers with which the company has established volume purchasing arrangements 
the company controls fuel purchases by using its proprietary software and qualcomm communications ability to schedule fueling stops and amounts purchased based upon fuel prices at locations on drivers routes 
the company historically has been able to pass through most increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of higher rates and fuel surcharges 
the company has fuel surcharge agreements with a majority of its customers 
however  the recent increases in fuel prices are not fully offset by these surcharges 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recoverable 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
the company experienced the highest driver turnover in its history in fiscal  measuring from the time the driver is assigned a tractor 
the company s driver turnover in fiscal is believed to be higher than the industry generally 
this shortage caused the company to implement a driver pay increase effective november  the company could be forced to further increase the compensation it pays to drivers or curtail the company s growth  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment has experienced greater supply than demand in  and if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
acquisitions 
in december  the company announced the signing of a definitive acquisition agreement 
the agreement has not been consummated as of the date of this report and is subject to certain conditions to closing  including due diligence 
this acquisition  and any other acquisition by the company  involves numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating operations  diversion of management time  exposure to successor liability issues  and the potential loss of customers  key employees  and drivers of the acquired company  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are fluctuations in fuel prices and interest rates on our debt financing 
we are not engaged in any fuel hedging transactions 
thus  we are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices but are not exposed to any market risk involving hedging costs 
the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are interest rates on our debt financing 
our variable rate debt consists of a revolving line of credit  and an equipment finance term loan carrying interest rates tied to libor or the eurodollar rate 
these variable interest rates expose us to the risk that interest rates may rise 
at september   assuming borrowing equal to the million drawn on the line of credit and  on other outstanding variable rate loans  a one percentage point increase in the libor and eurodollar rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  the balance of our equipment financing carries fixed interest rates and includes term notes payable and capitalized leases totaling approximately million 
these fixed interest rates expose us to the risk that interest rates may fall 
a one percentage point decline in interest rates would have the effect of increasing the premium we pay over market interest rates by one percentage point or approximately  annually
