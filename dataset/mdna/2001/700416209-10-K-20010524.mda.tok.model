item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
park is a leading global designer and producer of advanced electronic materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and electronic interconnection systems 
the company s customers for its advanced printed circuit materials include leading independent circuit board fabricators  electronic manufacturing service companies and large electronic equipment manufacturers in the computer  telecommunications  transportation  aerospace and instrumentation industries 
the company s electronic materials operations accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximately and of net sales worldwide in the and fiscal years  respectively 
the company s foreign operations accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximately and of net sales worldwide in the and fiscal years  respectively 
park is also engaged in the specialty adhesive tape business and advanced composite business  both of which operate as independent business units 
in addition  park operated a plumbing hardware business  which it decided to close and liquidate in the fiscal year fourth quarter 
the company s specialty adhesive tape  advanced composite and plumbing hardware businesses accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales worldwide in the fiscal year and approximately and of net sales worldwide in the and fiscal years  respectively 
the company s sales growth during the last three fiscal years is attributable to strong growth in sales by its electronic materials operations in north america  excluding the loss of sales to delco electronics  discussed below  and its electronic materials operations in europe and asia 
the company s ongoing efforts to expand its higher technology  higher margin product lines have been significant factors in the growth of the company s sales of electronic materials  and the company introduced several new electronic materials products during the past three fiscal years 
while the company s sales increased during each of the last three fiscal years  the earnings growth that the company achieved during its fiscal year did not continue in the fiscal year  primarily as a result of an earnings decline in the company s north american electronic materials operations  which was caused by the loss of sales to delco electronics 
nevertheless  the company s earnings growth resumed in the fiscal year  despite the significant losses incurred by the company s mass lamination busi ness in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics and despite the significant charges related to the closure and the write down of the assets of the plumbing hardware business and the fiscal year operating loss of that business 
in the fiscal year  the company s earnings reached record levels as a result of the surge in demand for the company s electronic materials products throughout the global electronics markets served by the company and the company s continuing emphasis on its higher technology product lines 
growth of the company s electronic materials business was constrained in various geographic regions during the last three fiscal years by the company s available manufacturing capacity  although the company has been expanding the manufacturing capacity of its electronic materials facilities in recent years 
nevertheless  all the company s electronic materials facilities were operating at full capacity during the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year  the company completed expansions of its electronic materials operations in singapore and france  acquired additional manufacturing capacity in california  and commenced significant additional expansions of its electronic materials operations in california and new york  which it expects to complete in its fiscal year 
during the fiscal year  the company commenced a significant expansion of its higher technology product line manufacturing facility in arizona  which was recently completed 
during the company s fiscal year and for several years prior thereto  more than of the company s total sales were to delco electronics corporation  a subsidiary of general motors corp 
however  in march  the company was informed by delco that delco planned to close its printed circuit board fabrication plant and completely exit the printed circuit board manufacturing business 
as a result  the company s sales to delco declined during the three month period ended may   were negligible during the three month period ended august   were nil during the remainder of the fiscal year and during the and fiscal years and are expected to be nil in future years 
in may  the company and its nelco technology  inc nti subsidiary in arizona filed a complaint against delco electronics corporation and the delphi automotive systems unit of general motors corp 
in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that delco breached its contract to purchase semi finished multilayer printed circuit boards from nti and that delphi interfered with nti s contract with delco  that delco breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the contract  that delco engaged in negligent misrepresentation and that delco fraudulently induced nti to enter into the contract 
the company and nti sought substantial compensatory and punitive damages 
in november  a jury awarded damages to nti in the amount of  and in december the judge in the united states district court for the district of arizona entered judgment for nti on its claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with damages in the amount of  both parties filed motions for post judgment relief and a new trial  all of which the judge denied  and both parties have filed notices to appeal the decision to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in san francisco 
although the company s electronic materials business was not dependent on this single customer  the loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on this business in the last three fiscal years and may have a material adverse effect on this business in the fiscal year ending march  and in subsequent fiscal years 
on april   the company announced that it was selling the assets and business of nti and announced that it expects to record a charge of approximately million in its fiscal year first quarter ending may  in connection with the sale of nti and the closure of a related support facility also located in arizona 
the company also announced in late april that as a result of a severe correction and downturn in the global electronics industry  the company s electronic materials sales volumes during the first two months of the fiscal year are running at approximately one half of the sales levels during the fiscal year and that the company expects to report a loss in its fiscal year first quarter 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was largely responsible for the dramatic improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended february  the north american  asian and european markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials were extremely strong during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in all three geographic areas performed well as a result 
the company s results of operations and margins improved in the fiscal year principally as a result of the optimal utilization of the electronic materials business manufacturing resources and the business increase in its market share with certain key customers and increase in its sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite businesses increased during the fiscal year as the result of higher volume of materials shipped 
sales by the specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite businesses increased to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
sales of the plumbing hardware business  which the company closed and liquidated in the first half of the fiscal year  declined from million in the fiscal year to million in the fiscal year 
the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
the increase in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was due to increases in sales by both the asian and european operations of the company 
the gross margin for the company s continuing worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the increase in the gross margin was attributable to efficiencies achieved by operating facilities at levels close to their designed capacity in the fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products as a percentage of total sales and increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year 
this decrease was a result of the partially fixed nature of these expenses and the company s increased sales in the fiscal year 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  increased to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the increase in investment income was attributable to increased cash available for investment and higher prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with million during the fiscal year 
the company s interest expense was related primarily to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due issued in february see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a change in the company s income mix among the tax jurisdictions in which the company does business 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations offset  in part  by the higher effective tax rate 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year the company s electronic materials business was largely responsible for the improvement in the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended february  the north american  european and asian markets for sophisticated printed circuit materials strengthened during the fiscal year  and the company s electronic materials operations located in each region performed well as a result 
however  the absence of business with delco electronics during the fiscal year adversely affected the company s sales volume in north america and negatively affected the company s margins 
the company s results of operations and margins improved in the fiscal year principally as a result of the electronic material business enhanced capacity utilization and the business increase in its market share with certain key customers and increase in its sales of higher technology  higher margin products 
however  the company s electronic materials business also experienced inefficiencies resulting from the operation of certain of its facilities at levels in excess of their designed manufacturing capacity  difficulty associated with the integration of a small acquisition which was consummated in the fiscal year second quarter  price pressure exerted by customers  and  most important  significant pre tax losses at its arizona based business unit which formerly supplied delco electronics corporation with semi finished circuit boards  or mass lamination product  all of which negatively affected the company s margins during the year 
operating results of the company s specialty adhesive tape  advanced composite materials and plumbing hardware businesses declined severely during the fiscal year 
this decline was attributable to a million pre tax charge for the closure of the plumbing hardware business and the related write down of the assets of that business and to the million operating loss of the plumbing hardware business during the year 
results of operations sales for the fiscal year ended february  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  sales of the electronic materials business for the fiscal year were million  or of total sales worldwide  compared with million  or of total sales worldwide  for the fiscal year 
this increase in sales of electronic materials was principally the result of higher volume of electronic materials shipped and an increase in sales of higher technology products 
sales of the specialty adhesive tape  advanced composite materials and plumbing hardware businesses declined during the fiscal year due to reduced volume of plumbing hardware products shipped  which more than offset the sales increases by the specialty adhesive tape and advanced composite businesses 
this resulted in an overall decline of in the specialty adhesive tape  advanced composite materials and plumbing hardware businesses sales to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended february   sales of the company s continuing operations  excluding the plumbing hardware business which the company decided to close during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended february  the company s foreign operations accounted for million of sales  or of the company s total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year  compared with million of sales  or of total sales worldwide  during the fiscal year 
sales by the company s foreign operations during the fiscal year increased from the fiscal year 
the increase in sales by the company s foreign operations in the fiscal year was principally due to an increase in sales by the company s european electronic materials operations 
the gross margin for the company s worldwide operations was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the gross margin for the company s continuing worldwide operations  excluding the plumbing hardware business  was during the fiscal year compared with for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross margin was attributable to the increases in sales volumes over the fiscal year  the continuing growth in sales of higher technology  higher margin products and increases in market share with certain key electronic materials customers 
however  the favorable impact of these factors was partially offset by the absence of sales volumes with delco electronics  inefficiencies caused by operating certain facilities at levels in excess of their designed manufacturing capacity  difficulty associated with the integration of a small acquisition which was consummated in the fiscal year second quarter  price pressure exerted by customers and the significant losses incurred by the company s mass lamination business in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics 
selling  general and administrative expenses  measured as a percentage of sales  were during the fiscal year and the fiscal year and  excluding the plumbing hardware business closure and asset write down charge and operating loss  were during the fiscal year and during the fiscal year 
the decline resulted from proportionately greater sales compared to the fiscal year 
for the reasons set forth above  profit from operations for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year  while profit from the company s continuing operations  excluding the plumbing hardware business  for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
interest and other income  principally investment income  declined to million for the fiscal year from million for the fiscal year 
the decrease in investment income was attributable to the reduction in cash available for investment and a decline in the prevailing interest rates during the fiscal year 
the company s investments were primarily short term taxable instruments and government securities 
interest expense for the fiscal year was million compared with million during the fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense was attributable to the reduction in interest capitalized to fixed assets 
the company s interest expense was related primarily to its million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due issued in february see liquidity and capital resources elsewhere in this item the company s effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was compared with for the fiscal year 
this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a change in the company s income mix among the tax jurisdictions in which the company does business 
net earnings for the fiscal year increased to million from million for the fiscal year 
basic and diluted earnings per share increased to and  respectively  for the fiscal year from and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
this increase in net earnings and earnings per share was primarily attributable to the increase in the profit from operations  which was constricted by the higher effective tax rate  the charge for the closure and the related write down of the assets of the plumbing hardware business  the operating loss of the plumbing hardware business and the loss incurred in the fiscal year by the business unit in arizona which formerly supplied delco electronics corporation with semi finished multilayer circuit boards 
without the plumbing hardware business closure and asset write down charge and operating loss  net earnings for the fiscal year would have increased to million from million for the fiscal year  and basic and diluted earnings per share would have increased by and  respectively  for the fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources at february   the company s cash and temporary investments were million compared with million at february   the end of the company s fiscal year 
the increase in the company s cash and investment position at february  was attributable to increased cash provided from operating activities  as discussed below 
the company s working capital was million at february  compared with million at february  the increase at february  compared with february  was due principally to higher cash and temporary investments and inventories  offset in part by higher current liabilities 
the increase in inventories and current liabilities at february  compared with february  was a result principally of increased operating activity in support of higher sales volumes 
the company s current ratio the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at february  compared with to at february  during the fiscal year  the company generated funds from operations of million and expended million for the net purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash provided by net earnings  before depreciation and amortization  of million combined with a net decrease in non cash working capital items resulted in million of cash provided from operating activities 
a major portion of the fiscal year s capital expenditures related to the expansions of the company s electronic materials facilities in arizona  california and new york 
these expansions will increase the company s capacity and capability for the production of sophisticated printed circuit materials 
net expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in the  and fiscal years  respectively 
the company expects the capital expenditures in the fiscal year to be less than the expenditures in the fiscal year but greater than the expenditures in the fiscal year 
at february   the company s only long term debt was the convertible subordinated notes due the notes issued at the end of the fiscal year 
during the company s fiscal year   principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  and immediately after the end of the fiscal year   principal amount of notes was converted into  shares of the company s common stock  all at a conversion price of per share 
on march   the company redeemed  principal amount of notes for a redemption price of  including accrued interest for each  principal amount note pursuant to a previous announcement that on march  it would redeem all of the outstanding notes that were not converted on or before march  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the company believes its financial resources will be sufficient  for the foreseeable future  to provide for continued investment in working capital and property  plant and equipment and for general corporate purposes 
such resources would also be available for appropriate acquisitions and other expansions of the company s business 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local government requirements relating to the protection of the environment 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accord with environmental laws and regulations 
however  mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies  which were generally in compliance with applicable laws at the time of the operations in question  the company  like other companies engaged in similar businesses  is a party to claims by government agencies and third parties and has incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs associated with environmental matters 
additional claims and costs involving past environmental matters may continue to arise in the future 
it is the company s policy to record appropriate liabilities for such matters when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in the  and fiscal years  the company charged approximately million  million and million  respectively  against pretax income for remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs including legal fees 
while annual expenditures have generally been constant from year to year  and may increase over time  the company expects it will be able to fund such expenditures from cash flow from operations 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors  including regulatory approval of cleanup projects  remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties 
at february  and february   the recorded liability in accrued liabilities for environmental matters was million 
management does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the liquidity  capital resources  business or consolidated financial position of the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s commitments and contingencies  including those related to environmental matters 
factors that may affect future results 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
certain portions of this report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from park s expectations or from results which might be projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking statements 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in forward looking statements 

the company s customer base is concentrated  in part  because the company s business strategy has been to develop long term relationships with a select group of customers 
during the company s fiscal year ended february   the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales 
the company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
a loss of one or more of such key customers could affect the company s profitability 
see business electronic materials operations customers and end markets in item of this report  legal proceedings in item of this report and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this report for discussions of the loss of a key customer early in the fiscal year 

the company s business is dependent on certain aspects of the electronics industry  which is a cyclical industry and which has experienced recurring downturns 
the downturns  such as occurred in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ended march  and in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year ending march   can be unexpected and have often reduced demand for  and prices of  electronic materials 

the company s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including various factors beyond the company s control 
such factors include economic conditions in the electronics industry  the timing of customer orders  product prices  process yields  the mix of products sold and maintenance related shutdowns of facilities 
operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products and the costs associated with the start up of new facilities 

the company s production processes require the use of substantial amounts of gas and electricity  the cost and available supply of which are beyond the control of the company 
changes in the cost or availability of gas or electricity could materially increase the company s cost of operations 

rapid technological advances in semiconductors and electronic equipment have placed rigorous demands on the electronic materials manufactured by the company and used in printed circuit board production 
the company s operating results will be affected by the company s ability to maintain and increase its technological and manufacturing capability and expertise in this rapidly changing industry 

the electronic materials industry is intensely competitive and the company competes worldwide in the market for materials used in the production of complex multilayer printed circuit boards 
the company s principal competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the company  and the company s operating results will be affected by its ability to maintain its competitive position in the industry 

there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of the prin cipal materials used by the company in its manufacture of electronic materials products 
substitutes for these products are not readily available  and in the recent past there have been shortages in the market for certain of these materials 

the company typically does not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments 
instead  it relies primarily on continual communication with its customers to anticipate the future volume of purchase orders 
a variety of conditions  both specific to the individual customer and generally affecting the customer s industry  can cause a customer to reduce or delay orders previously anticipated by the company 

the company  from time to time  is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities for electronic materials 
the anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted 
in addition  such expansions will increase the company s fixed costs 
the company s future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner 

the company s business is capital intensive and  in addition  the introduction of new technologies could substantially increase the company s capital expenditures 
in order to remain competitive the company must continue to make significant investments in capital equipment and expansion of operations 
this may require that the company continue to be able to access capital on terms acceptable to the company 

the company may acquire businesses  product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the company 
the integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the company s management resources and technical  financial and operating systems 
in addition  implementation of acquisitions can result in large one time charges and costs 
a given acquisition  if consummated  may materially affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

the company s international operations are subject to risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 

a portion of the sales and costs of the company s international operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the company s success is dependent upon its relationship with key management and technical personnel 

the company s future success depends in part upon its intel lectual property which the company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions  trade secret protections  copyrights and patents 

the company s production processes require the use  storage  treatment and disposal of certain materials which are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and the company is subject to a variety of regulatory requirements relating to the handling of such materials and the release of emissions and effluents into the environment 
other possible developments  such as the enactment or adoption of additional environmental laws  could result in substantial costs to the company 

the market price of the company s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the electronic materials industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the company 

the company s results could be affected by changes in the company s accounting policies and practices or changes in the company s organization  compensation and benefit plans  or changes in the company s material agreements or understandings with third parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s primary foreign currency exchange exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries using currencies other than the us dollar as their functional currency 
the company does not believe that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates to the company s short term investment portfolio 
this investment portfolio is managed by outside professional man agers in accordance with guidelines issued by the company 
these guidelines are designed to establish a high quality fixed income portfolio of government and highly rated corporate debt securities with a maximum weighted maturity of less than one year 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
based on the average maturity of the investment portfolio at the end of the fiscal year a increase in short term interest rates would not have had a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company
