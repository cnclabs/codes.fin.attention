see  business regulation 
as a holding company with no other business operations  we rely primarily on fees generated by our management agreement with our insurance subsidiaries and dividend payments from vesta fire to meet our cash requirements including our debt service and to pay dividends to our stockholders

cash flows the principal sources of funds for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums  investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets 
such funds are used principally for the payment of claims  operating expenses  commissions and the purchase of investments 
as is typical in the insurance industry  we collect cash in the form of premiums and invest that cash until claims are paid 
cash collected from premiums and cash paid for claims is included in cash flow from operations  while the cash impact from our investing activities is included in cash flow from investing activities 
in periods such as and  where we are exiting certain lines of business such as commercial lines and reinsurance assumed lines we are funding the payout of commercial and reinsurance assumed claims through the liquidation of invested assets  consistent with the historical insurance business model 
however  this generates cash outflows from operations that can be misleading 
on a consolidated basis  net cash used in operations for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
of those amounts  for the years ended december  and  approximately  million and million  respectively represented the cash outflows from our reinsurance assumed and commercial lines  funded with the liquidation of their corresponding invested assets 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively as we funded the discontinuance of the reinsurance assumed and commercial lines of business 
we also utilized the excess cash generated by our investing activities to retire debt and other financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively as we aggressively repurchased outstanding debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments vesta s principal assets are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary risk exposures on assets are interest rate risk on fixed maturity investments  and mortgage and collateral loans and equity price risk for domestic stocks 
in addition  our outstanding annuity liabilities are subject to interest rate risk  although  many of our products contain surrender charges and other features that reward persistency and penalize early withdrawal of funds 
vesta manages its exposure to market risk by selecting investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the related insurance 
the following table sets forth the estimated market values of our fixed maturity investments  mortgage and collateral loans  annuities  and equity investments resulting from a hypothetical immediate basis point adverse change in interest rates and a decline in market prices for equity exposures  respectively from levels prevailing at december  amount in thousands fixed maturity investments  equity investments  mortgage and collateral loans  annuity liabilities  the decrease in fair values based on an adverse change in interest rates for fixed maturity investments  mortgage and collateral loans  and annuity liabilities  was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
the decrease in fair value of equity securities based on a decrease in the market prices of all equity securities was estimated as of the fair value
