item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not earnings or cash flows 
griffin does not have an obligation to prepay any fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and therefore  interest rate risk and changes in the fair market value of fixed rate debt should not have a significant impact on earnings or cash flows until such debt is refinanced  if necessary 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
griffin had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  griffin s variable rate debt was repaid in january from the proceeds received from the sale of imperial s sscs 
griffin is exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on market values of griffin s cash equivalent short term investments 
these investments generally consist of overnight investments that are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned and cash flow from these investments 
griffin does not currently have any derivative financial instruments in place to manage interest costs  but that does not mean that griffin will not use them as a means to manage interest rate risk in the future 
griffin does not use foreign currency exchange forward contracts or commodity contracts and does not have foreign currency exposure in operations 
griffin does have investments in companies based in the united kingdom  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could affect the results of equity investments in griffin s statement of operations  and the ultimate liquidation of those investments and conversion of proceeds into united states currency is subject to future foreign currency exchange rates
