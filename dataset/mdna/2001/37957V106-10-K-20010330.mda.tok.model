overview globespan  inc is a leading provider of advanced integrated circuits that enable broadband digital communications to homes and business enterprises 
we design  develop and supply these integrated semiconductor chips  or chip sets  for use in dsl networks  which utilize the existing network of copper telephone wires known as the local loop for the high speed transmission of data 
our products target the rapidly growing market for high speed data transmission applications such as internet access  telecommuting and networking among branch offices 
these transmission applications are expanding to include voice and video transmissions over the same copper wire 
we sell our integrated circuits to equipment manufacturers for incorporation into products that are sold to telecommunications service providers and end users worldwide 
in an effort to provide system level products to our customers  we have developed system on chip solutions that integrate the functionality of multiple discrete components  memory  microprocessors and software onto a single chip 
these system level products allow our customers to reduce the time it takes for their products to reach the market and to focus their resources on adding features and functions to differentiate their product offerings from those of their competitors 
our recent acquisitions provide us with additional design and product development resources and expertise 
we are utilizing these skills and resources to add greater networking functionality to our chip sets and to capture more of the system functions used in dsl system solutions in our products 
we have shipped our chip set solutions to a broad base of leading communications equipment manufacturers including  alcatel  cisco systems  intel corporation  lucent technologies  nec corporation  nokia corporation  and nortel networks  among others 
historically  a significant portion of our net revenues in any quarter or annual period has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
in the years ended december   and  our customers who individually represented more than of our net revenues accounted for   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
in our top three customers were cisco systems  lucent technologies and nortel networks  which accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  our top three customers were cisco systems  lucent technologies and ascom hasler ag  which accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  our top three customers were cisco systems  nec corporation and ascom hasler ag  which accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
we do not have long term purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
because fluctuations in orders from our major customers could cause our net revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or annual period  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
members of the group comprising our largest customers change frequently due to our lack of long term contracts with our customers  the timing of our customers product implementations  demand cycles in the sales of our customers products and our long sales cycle 
in particular  the amount of revenues we derive from our customers depends upon their success in selling dsl equipment to telecommunications service providers for use in dsl service deployments 
our largest customers in any particular period have varied with the timing of dsl deployments and the identity of the telecommunications service provider initiating the deployment 
further  since we are a worldwide supplier  our net revenues and customers may be influenced by local economic conditions that influence our customers level of business with us 
our long sales cycle is another factor in the frequent change of our principal customers 
in general  our customers will evaluate our products for three to six months prior to incorporating our products into their products and beginning volume production 
as a result  our principal customers will vary depending on their stage in the sales cycle 
historically  a significant portion of our net revenues has been derived from customers outside of north america  and we expect this trend to continue 
in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
in  approximately of our net revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers based in europe  were derived from customers based in asia and were derived from customers based in other international markets 
substantially all of our net revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
competition and technological change in the rapidly evolving dsl market has and may continue to influence our quarterly and annual net revenues and results of operations 
average selling prices of our chip sets and associated gross margins tend to be higher at the time we introduce new products and decline over time due to competitive pressures 
we expect this pattern to continue with existing and future products 
further  our gross margins are impacted by our customer concentration and product mix 
for example  purchases from our major customers are generally at lower average selling prices and certain of our products  such as discrete components  are generally lower margin products 
our product development and marketing strategy is focused on generating design wins with dsl equipment manufacturers 
the sales cycle for design wins includes detailed testing and evaluation of our products  followed by a product development cycle 
due to these cycles  which may be up to months or longer  and because the end user market for dsl services is an emerging market  we invest significant resources in research and development and marketing in advance of generating substantial revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
our backlog has fluctuated from quarter to quarter and has not been predictive of quarterly results 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect and we are unable to predict or adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses and inventory levels may increase as a percentage of net revenues and total assets  respectively 
our net losses have resulted from our significant investment in research and development  in building sales and marketing and general and administrative infrastructure and from the effects of purchase accounting for our acquisitions 
these expenses have exceeded our gross profits 
we expect to continue to invest significant resources in this infrastructure in advance of realizing revenues associated with these expenses 
each of the acquisitions we made in was accounted for as a purchase acquisition 
under purchase accounting  we recorded the market value of our shares of common stock issued in connection with the purchases and the amount of direct transaction costs as the cost of acquiring the companies 
that cost was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including various identifiable and intangible assets such as in process research and development  acquired technology  acquired trademarks and trade names and acquired workforce  based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets to intangible assets 
we estimate that the purchase of ficon  t 
sqware  icompression  atecom and the intangible assets of pairgain will result in annual amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges of approximately to million  using useful lives of two to four years 
as a result  purchase accounting treatment of our recent acquisitions will result in a net loss for the foreseeable future  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our stock 
we will continue to seek out other acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future

our net revenues were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent increases of from to  and from to the net increase in revenues was primarily due to the increases in unit volume shipments to existing customers  the expansion of our customer base and the introduction of new products  and  to a lesser extent  net revenues from acquired businesses 
net revenues from customers outside of north america represented   and of our net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net revenues from customers outside of north america represent a portion of our net revenues due to the third party manufacturing of our customers product at offshore locations and the implementation of dsl in international markets 
we expect that net revenues generated from customers outside of north america will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an increase of from to and from to our gross margin was  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin each year was related to lower average selling prices due to increased unit volume shipped 
the increase in gross profit dollars was the result of higher net revenues 
we expect gross margins may decrease in the future due to a number of factors  including pressures on average selling prices  product mix and customer mix 
during  in consideration for modifying pricing terms for the sale of our products under certain cooperative development agreements with paradyne networks  we agreed to pay a license fee to paradyne networks on products sold to all customers up to an aggregate amount of million 
as of march  we had incurred and paid approximately  to paradyne networks under that arrangement 
in connection with terminating the cooperative development agreements and entering into a new supply agreement effective december with paradyne networks  we agreed to pay paradyne networks the remaining million  which was recorded as termination charge 
this amount was paid and recorded through cost of goods sold in research and development 
research and development expenditures are comprised primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include related supplies  license fees for acquired technologies used in research and development  equipment expenses and depreciation and amortization 
included in research and development expenditures for the year ended december  is million of non cash compensation 
during the year ended december   we exchanged our common stock with employee principals of an acquired entity which was considered compensation and we granted certain employees stock options at less than fair market value 
the deferred stock compensation recorded is being amortized over the respective vesting periods ranging from six months to four years 
our research and development expenditures were million including non cash compensation of million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent increases of excluding non cash compensation from to and from to the increase in research and development spending during is attributable primarily to the increase in the number of employees engaged in research  design and development activities during research and development expenditures represented excluding non cash compensation  and of net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenues was due to our increased revenue 
the dollar amount of our research and development expense may increase in the future due to planned additional increases in personnel and related support expenses  prototyping costs and depreciation resulting from increased capital investment 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  general and administrative personnel as well as general non personnel related expenses 
included in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  is million of non cash compensation 
during the year ended december   we exchanged our common stock with employee principals of an acquired entity which was considered compensation  we granted certain employees stock options at less than fair market value and we granted options to non employees 
the deferred stock compensation recorded is being amortized over the respective vesting periods ranging from six months to four years 
the non employee options  valued at million  were recorded to expense when they were issued as the performance required to earn those options was complete 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million including million of non cash compensation  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts represent increases of excluding non cash compensation from to and from to selling  general and administrative expense represented excluding non cash compensation  and of net revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in dollars resulted from the increase in sales  marketing and administrative personnel and related expenses including expenses from our acquisitions  increased commissions and administrative costs 
the decrease in the percentage of selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues was due to higher net revenues 
the dollar amount of our selling  general and administrative expense may increase in the future due to increases in personnel  higher commissions and administrative costs 
in process research and development 
during the year ended december   we completed several acquisitions that had development projects which were not yet complete at the date of the acquisitions 
the amount allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d  of million was expensed upon acquisition  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technical feasibility  had no alternative future use and successful development was uncertain 
the increase in the dollar amount and percentage is the result of expensing ipr d acquired 
see financial statements note amortization of intangible assets 
during the year ended december   we completed several acquisitions 
the increase in dollar amount and percentage of amortization expense is the result of our amortizing the intangible assets acquired on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
amortization expense prior to is related to the core technology we acquired from lucent technologies in our expense for amortization was million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest expense non cash 
as part of the purchase price for the microelectronics group of pairgain  we issued a subordinated redeemable convertible note with a beneficial conversion feature measured by the price of our common stock at closing of the acquisition and the conversion price as defined 
we amortized the difference between the price of our common stock at the closing of the acquisition and the conversion price of approximately million through august   the date we repaid the note 
the increase in dollar amount and percentage is the result of the amortization 
interest income expense  net 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  offset by interest expense of million  resulting in net interest income of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  which resulted from interest earned on invested cash  net of interest expense on bank borrowings and other debt  and other non operating expenses 
the increase in interest income  net of 
million was primarily the result of higher cash balances during  and a reduction in interest expense from outstanding debt  offset by million of interest expense related to the subordinated redeemable convertible note 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was  excluding the tax effect of non cash interest expense and the extraordinary gain related to the subordinated redeemable convertible note issued in connection with the pairgain acquisition 
the effective rate is impacted by permanent differences which resulted from the company s acquisitions  and an increase in the valuation allowance 
during and  the company incurred losses and therefore had established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
extraordinary gain 
in connection with the repayment of the subordinated redeemable convertible note issued by us to pairgain  the company recognized a gain of million on the redemption of the beneficial conversion feature 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hedging activities  which amended statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of statement the company will be required to adopt these statements for the year ending december  statements and establish methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
because we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities  adoption of these statements is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets at december  were million  an increase of million  or  from december  total assets of million 
the increase from december  is primarily a result of intangible assets from our acquisitions during  as well as increases in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories  primarily as a result of the significant growth in our revenues during as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  of which million was in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  of which million was in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher revenues during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the increase in net cash used from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to the timing of expenditures 
net cash generated from investing activities amounted to million for the year ended december  net cash received from the acquisition of businesses of million  proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of million and the sale of an intangible asset of 
million  were offset by purchases of property and equipment and purchases of marketable securities of million and million  respectively for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash used primarily related to investments in marketable securities and preferred stock during the year ended december  and capital expenditures during the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily consisted of net proceeds from a follow on public offering and other proceeds from the issuances of common stock of million  offset by a million repayment of a subordinated redeemable convertible note issued by us in connection with our acquisition of the microelectronics group of pairgain and other miscellaneous items 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in the years ended december and  respectively and was provided by the issuance of common and preferred stock  other debt and bank borrowings 
we believe that our sources of capital  including internally generated funds and the net proceeds from our follow on public offering  net of the repayment of the subordinated redeemable convertible note  will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least one year 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses and products and technologies that are complimentary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we can not raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
although we experienced no significant year disruptions we will continue to monitor developments the year issue refers generally to the problems that some software may have in determining the correct century of the year 
in late  we completed our year compliance project 
as a result of our efforts  we experienced no significant disruptions related to year we are not aware of any material problems resulting from year issues  either with our products  our internal systems  or the products and services of suppliers 
the incremental costs related to the year project were not material to the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
we have not experienced any significant issues and will continue to monitor throughout year our critical computer applications  and those of our suppliers  to ensure that any year matters that may arise are addressed promptly 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   substantially all of our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposits  or high quality commercial paper
