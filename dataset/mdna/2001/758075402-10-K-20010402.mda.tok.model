results of operations earnings summary core earnings were per share for the fourth quarter of and per share for fiscal year  in each case a new record for redwood 
increases in core earnings per share were for the fourth quarter and for the full year of as compared to the same periods in core earnings are earnings from ongoing operations before mark to market adjustments and non recurring items 
reported earnings per share were for the fourth quarter and for the year we paid per common share in dividends in year book value rose from to per share during revenues summary most of our revenue comes from the monthly mortgage payments that homeowners make on their mortgage loans 
to a lesser degree  we also earn revenues from commercial mortgage loans 
total revenues increased from million in to million in our average balance of earning assets remained constant at billion  while our average asset yield increased from to 
asset yields increased because we shifted our asset mix towards higher yielding products  coupon rates on our adjustable rate mortgages rose in conjunction with increases in short term interest rates  premium amortization expenses declined as mortgage prepayment rates slowed  and credit provision expenses declined due to strong portfolio credit performance 
from to  revenues declined from million to million 
asset yields increased from to  but average earning assets declined from billion to billion as we utilized a significant portion of our capital to repurchase our common stock 
asset yields rose  despite a decrease in mortgage coupon rates  due to a significant decline in premium amortization expenses 
premium amortization expenses declined as a result of significantly reduced premium balances and slower mortgage prepayment rates 
in  we expect that revenues may decline from the million that we earned in  although we currently expect that interest expenses may decline faster than revenues and that our net interest income may benefit in the short term 
we expect revenues to decline as asset yields decline along with falling short term interest rates and as premium amortization expenses increase along with faster mortgage prepayment rates 
our average earning assets could decline  leading to reduced revenues  should we acquire additional credit enhancement interests or other assets that require a greater amount of capital per dollar of revenue generated 
declining revenues from such a change in asset mix would not necessarily imply a decline in net interest income  for liabilities would decline under such a strategy as well 
if we raise additional equity capital in  we plan to acquire additional assets  and revenues would likely increase

the following discussion of our assets contains statistics that in some cases have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by servicing entities and information service providers 
residential credit enhancement portfolio we actively added to our residential credit enhancement portfolio during  increasing our commitments by over 
pricing in this market was attractive due to reduced competition 
we were able to structure a number of attractive transactions involving seasoned loans which generally have less credit risk than newly originated loans 
in many of our transactions  with both new and seasoned loans  we were able to work with sellers to underwrite loans prior to securitization and to remove the more risky loans from the loan pools that we agreed to finance 
substantially all of the billion of loans that we added to our credit enhancement portfolio in and were a quality loans 
credit enhancement revenues were million in  million in  and million in much of this revenue goes directly to net interest income  as we utilize a relatively high percentage of equity to fund this portfolio 
increases in revenues were largely a result of increases in our credit enhancement portfolio 
our credit enhancement portfolio increased from under billion at the end of to billion at the end of and billion at the end of the principal value of our credit enhancement interests increased from million to million to million  and our net basis in these assets increased from million to million to million at the end of   and  respectively 
the yield on our net credit enhancement assets decreased from in to in to in given favorable credit results  yields on credit enhancement assets should increase over time 
our yields on the credit enhancement interests that we acquired from to have been growing 
our returns on these assets were further increased when we resecuritized these assets in december our average yield for all of our credit enhancement assets has decreased over time as we have acquired new credit enhancement interests and booked them at relatively low initial yields 
in addition  we have increased the percentage of second and third loss positions in our mix of credit enhancement assets  these assets have less risk but also lower yields 
given favorable credit results  we would expect to be able to increase the yields of our newer assets over time 
after a few years  we may be able to resecuritize these interests  thus further increasing their yields

we charged these losses against our credit reserve for these assets 
we designate a portion of the purchase discount that we book upon acquisition as credit reserve to provide for estimated future credit losses 
this effectively reduces our discount balances  and thus reduces discount amortization income and the yields that we recognize on these assets 
our designated credit reserve for our credit enhancement portfolio was million at the end of  million at the end of  and million at the end of some of our credit enhancement assets are themselves credit enhanced by securitized interests held by others often the originator that are junior to us  ie  we do not always hold a first loss position 
the first loss positions held by others are a form of credit reserve for us with respect to loan losses within our credit enhancement portfolio 
the principal value of interests junior to our positions at december  was million 
together with our credit reserve of million  our effective protection against credit losses in our credit enhancement portfolio at december  was million  or basis points of the current balance of the loans at that time  on average 
reserves  credit protection  and risks vary by asset  so we are still subject to loss on certain assets even with this high level of average overall credit protection 
if future credit losses exceed our expectations  we will increase our credit reserve on a specific asset basis 
we can do this by lowering the yield that we recognize on the asset by designating more of the purchase discount as reserve or  under new eitf accounting rules to be adopted in  by reducing our basis in an asset by marking it to market through the income statement

at december   our loans were most concentrated in the following states california  new york  new jersey  texas  and massachusetts 
no other state had more than 
most of the loans that we credit enhance are seasoned 
generally  the credit risk for these loans is reduced as property values have appreciated and the loan balances have amortized 
in effect  the current loan to value ratio for seasoned loans is often much reduced from the loan to value ratio at origination

many of our seriously delinquent loans cure without going into foreclosure

we ended the year with a credit reserve for this portfolio of million 
the year end reserve equals basis points 
of our year end loan balances 
the reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our mortgage loans  including current and projected economic conditions  delinquency status  and credit protection 
we are cautious about credit in the current economic environment  but we are comforted by the quality and seasoning of our portfolio and the size of our reserves 
we currently expect realized credit losses to increase somewhat in the future  based on current delinquency levels  the natural seasoning of the portfolios losses are more likely to occur in years two through five  and the weakening economic environment 
losses on our assets have historically been substantially lower than our original expectations

as short term interest rates drop  our cost of funds should generally decline more quickly than our asset yield 
while decreases in short term interest rates should be beneficial for earnings in  our primary focus is on increasing our normalized rate of income generation through growth in our high quality jumbo residential credit enhancement and retained loan portfolios and through retention of free cash flow in excess of our dividend requirements 
our average return on capital employed before overhead expenses was in  this measure equals net interest income divided by total capital 
returns have improved as we reduced our capital at holdings  improved our capital utilization rate  reduced our premium amortization expenses  and increased our residential credit enhancement and retained portfolios relative to our investment portfolio 
the competitive environment also has improved markedly since and as other financial institutions pulled back from the residential real estate finance market 
this allowed us to expand our activities through acquisition and credit enhancement of loans at attractive pricing levels 
we believe that our current marginal return on new capital employed may equal or exceed the average return on capital employed of that we earned in the fourth quarter of equity in earnings of rwt holdings for the year  a portion of our commercial loan origination and portfolio finance activities were conducted at holdings  our owned  unconsolidated affiliate 
most of our commercial loan revenues were earned by redwood 
redwood s share of holdings loss for the year was million 
see management s discussion and analysis for holdings below 
for year and beyond  holdings will be consolidated into redwood for accounting purposes as a result of redwood s acquisition of the remainder of holdings it did not already own 
this consolidation will reduce expenses 
operating expenses we incur operating expenses at redwood and at our unconsolidated affiliate  holdings 
a significant portion of these operating expenses in prior years were associated with business units that have since been closed 
combined operating expenses rose from to as we started new residential mortgage  finance and commercial mortgage loan origination operations at holdings 
some of these operations were restructured in  and the operating expenses incurred in include costs associated with the closing of these operations 
total combined operating expenses declined from million in to million in expenses associated with ongoing operations rose from million in to million in as we expanded our loan based activities and paid higher performance based compensation as earnings and dividends increased 
table operating expenses all dollars in thousands closed business redwood holdings combined ongoing units q     q     q     q      q    q    q    q    we focused during on reducing fixed costs  and we expect to benefit from these cost reductions going forward 
a large portion of our expenses are variable compensation expenses that depend on earnings per share and dividends per share and stock option expenses that depend on our stock price 
despite a reduction in fixed costs  our total ongoing combined operating expenses will likely increase in if our performance is strong 
we believe that we currently have the staff and systems that we will need to manage a much larger company 
thus  we believe that we are likely to benefit from substantial operating leverage in the event that we can raise additional equity capital in with growth in our portfolios and capital employed following an equity offering  we believe revenue growth will exceed growth in operating expenses 
this could would result in an increase in earnings per share and dividends per share

the result was to lower reported earnings by per share and to increase book value exclusive of the effect of reported earnings by per share

we will mark these through the income statement if the discounted present value of current cash flows deteriorates relative to our original assumptions 
only negative income statement mark to market adjustments are allowed under eitf any initial mark to market adjustments that we take upon adoption of eitf will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  any subsequent eitf adjustments will be included in our income statement under net realized and unrealized gains and losses with our other mark to market adjustments 
for each of our credit enhancement interests and other assets subject to eitf with the exception of one set of assets described below  we currently believe that projected cash flows have improved relative to our original assumptions  and  in most cases  market values have increased 
we have been marking to market  through our balance sheet  the assets that we retained from our resecuritization of the credit enhancement interests that we acquired from to the market values for these assets that we have been using for our balance sheet estimates are lower than our basis 
they reflect what we believe is an estimate of realizable sale value that is conservative and takes into consideration the unique and complex nature of the assets and their illiquidity 
we currently project that credit losses for these assets will be somewhat higher than we had originally projected 
accordingly  upon adoption of eitf  we will mark these assets  through our income statement  to the estimated market values that we use for our balance sheet 
we currently estimate that this mark to market adjustment would be approximately million if we make the adjustment in the first quarter of this adjustment will lower earnings in the quarter that we adopt eitf and will increase the asset yield and cumulative future earnings that we will recognize over the remaining life of these assets relative to what they would have been without the adjustment 
since we have already been marking these assets to market on our balance sheet  book value per share will be unaffected by this change in accounting principle 
with falling interest rates in the first half of  we would generally expect that the net market values of our asset and liabilities could increase as spread earnings opportunities increase 
net market values may decline later in the year should interest rates stabilize and spreads return to normalized levels 
shareholder wealth in the years since the founding of redwood  cumulative shareholder wealth  as described below  has grown at a compound rate of per year 
we define shareholder wealth as growth in tangible book value per share  plus dividends received  plus reinvestment earnings on dividends 
in calculating shareholder wealth  we assume that dividends are reinvested through the purchase of additional shares of redwood at book value 
with this assumption  shareholder wealth creation at redwood can be compared to book value per share growth at a non reit company that retains its earnings and compounds book value within the company 
this is a measure of management value added  not a measure of shareholder returns 
book value per share was in september when redwood commenced operations 
we increased book value to per share by december  through the retention of cash by keeping dividends lower than cash flow  changes in market values of assets  issuance of stock at prices above book value  and repurchases of stock below book value 
since we mark to market most of our assets through our balance sheet  reported book value is a good approximation of real intrinsic value in the company 
cumulative dividends paid during this period were per share  and reinvestment earnings on those dividends were per share 
thus  cumulatively  shareholder wealth has increased from per share to per share during this year period 
a company that earned an after tax return on equity and retained all its earnings would have shown a similar amount of shareholder wealth growth during this period

as a result  we currently expect to be able to make an additional net investment in our portfolio operations and or to be able to pay a dividend in excess of our minimum dividend requirements in the next year 
at december   we had over a dozen uncommitted facilities for short term collateralized debt  with credit approval for over billion of borrowings 
we had no difficulty securing short term borrowings on favorable terms during outstanding borrowings under these agreements were billion at year end and billion at year end we had three committed borrowing facilities for residential assets totaling million and two borrowing facilities for commercial assets totaling million 
there are certain restrictions regarding the collateral for which these committed facilities can be used  but they generally allow us to fund either our commercial mortgage loans or our residential credit enhancement interests 
we had no difficulty during in meeting the debt covenant tests required by our committed bank credit facility agreements  or in extending these facilities or negotiating new lines 
outstanding borrowings under these committed agreements  including borrowings by holdings  were million at year end and million at year end under our internal risk adjusted capital system  we maintain liquidity reserves in the form of cash and unpledged liquid assets 
these liquidity reserves may be needed in the event of a decline in the market value or in the acceptability to lenders of the collateral we pledge to secure short term borrowings  or for other liquidity needs 
we maintained liquidity reserves at or in excess of our policy levels during at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and highly liquid unpledged assets available to meet potential liquidity needs 
total available liquidity equaled of our short term debt balances 
at december   we had million of liquid assets  equaling of our short term debt balances 
at this time  we see no material negative trends that would affect our access to short term borrowings or bank credit lines  that would suggest that our liquidity reserves would be called upon  or that would be likely to cause us to be in danger of a covenant default 
however many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our liquidity in the future 
the billion of long term debt on our december  balance sheet is non recourse debt 
the holders of our long term debt can look only to the cash flow from the mortgages specifically collateralizing this debt for repayment 
by using this source of financing  our liquidity risks are limited 
our special purpose financing subsidiaries that issue this debt have no call on our general liquidity reserves  and there is no debt rollover risk as the loans are financed to maturity 
the market for aaa rated long term debt of the type that we issue is a large  global market that has been relatively stable for many years 
at this time  we know of no reason why we would not be able to issue more of this debt on reasonable terms in if we should choose to do so 
excluding short and long term collateralized debt  we are capitalized entirely by common and preferred equity capital 
our equity base increased from million to million during as a result of internal operations and stock issuance of million 
we do plan to raise new equity capital in the future when opportunities to expand our business are attractive and when such issuance is likely to benefit earnings and dividends per share 
we have not  to date  issued unsecured corporate debt 
in the future  we may consider issuing longer term unsecured corporate debt to supplement our capital base and improve the efficiency of our capital structure 
the amount of portfolio assets that can be supported with a given capital base is limited by our internal risk adjusted capital policies 
our risk adjusted capital policy guideline amounts are expressed in terms of an equity to assets ratio and vary with market conditions and asset characteristics 
at december   our minimum capital amounts were of residential credit enhancement portfolio interests  of net retained interests in residential retained loan portfolio after long term debt issuance  of short term debt funded residential whole loans  of investment portfolio securities  and of commercial retained loan portfolio 
our total risk adjusted capital guideline amount for assets on our balance sheet was million of asset balances at december  capital required for commitments for asset purchases settling in was million 
total capital was million  our capital exceeded our internal risk adjusted capital policy guideline minimum amount by million at december  at december   our capital base of million supported at risk assets excluding long term funded residential loans owned by financing trusts of million funded with short term debt of million 
excluding non recourse debt and related assets  our equity to assets ratio was and our debt to equity ratio was times at year end at year end  our equity to assets ratio was and our debt to equity ratio was times

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rwt holdings  inc holdings was incorporated in delaware in february and commenced operations on april  holdings start up operations have been funded primarily by redwood trust  which has a significant investment in holdings 
prior to january   redwood owned all of holdings non voting preferred stock 
redwood trust s senior management owned all of holdings voting common stock 
we refer you to note the company in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of rwt holdings  inc and taxable subsidiaries for additional information on holdings initial capitalization 
on january   redwood acquired the common stock of holdings and intends to operate holdings in the future as a wholly owned taxable subsidiary with consolidated financial statements 
holdings originated commercial mortgage loans for sale to institutional investors through its redwood commercial funding  inc rcf subsidiary 
rcf originated million of commercial mortgage loans in  million in  and million in after loan sales and payoffs  remaining commercial mortgage loans originated by rcf totaled million at december   of which million were owned by redwood and million were owned by holdings 
in  holdings sold million of commercial loans  some of them to redwood 
in addition  holdings sold the remaining residential loans that its wholly owned residential mortgage finance subsidiaries had previously acquired 
net gains on sales recognized by holdings in totaled million which were offset by unrealized losses on assets of million 
holdings had two other operating businesses  redwood financial services  inc rfs and redwood residential funding rrf 
due to a variety of start up difficulties with these units  operations were closed at rfs in the third quarter of and at rrf in the fourth quarter of these closures resulted in restructuring charges of million during the year ended december   and a significant reduction in the headcount and ongoing operating expenses at holdings 
this contributed to holdings recording a net loss of million in in  the initial start up expenses associated with these operations resulted in a net loss of million 
holdings recorded a net loss of million in this was based on net interest income of million  net gains on sales of million and operating expenses of million 
most of the commercial loans originated by rcf were owned by redwood for most of the year  so holdings did not benefit from the net interest income on these loans 
at december   holdings had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state income tax purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the risks inherent in all financial institutions interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment  and credit risks in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor to provide our shareholders an opportunity to realize an attractive total rate of return through stock ownership in our company 
we seek  to the best of our ability  to only assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do undertake 
market value risk at december   we owned mortgage securities and loans totaling billion that we account for on a mark to market basis in the case of mortgage loans  on a lower of cost or market basis for purposes of determining reported earnings 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons and had fixed rate coupons 
all of our billion in notional amounts of interest rate agreements are marked to market for income statement purposes 
market value fluctuations of these assets and interest rate agreements not only affect our earnings  but also can affect our liquidity  especially to the extent they are funded with short term borrowings 
at december   we owned million of assets that are marked to market on our balance sheet 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the reported value of our stockholders equity base interest rate risk at december   we owned billion of assets and had billion of liabilities 
the majority of the assets were adjustable rate  as were a majority of the liabilities 
on average  our cost of funds has the ability to rise or fall more quickly as a result of changes in short term interest rates than does the earning rate on our assets 
in addition  in the case of a large increase in short term interest rates  periodic and lifetime caps for a portion of our assets could limit increases in interest income 
the risk of reduced earnings in a rising interest rate environment may be mitigated to some extent by our interest rate agreements hedging program and by any concurrent slowing of mortgage prepayment rates that may occur 
at december   we owned hybrid mortgage assets with fixed rate coupons for to years and adjustable rate coupons thereafter totaling billion 
we had debt with interest rate reset characteristics matched to the hybrid mortgages totaling billion 
at december   we owned billion of adjustable rate mortgage assets with coupons that adjust monthly as a function of one month libor interest rates  funded with equity and with debt that also adjusts monthly as a function of one month libor interest rates 
the spread between the coupon rates on these assets and the cost of funds of our liabilities has been stable 
for other parts of our balance sheet  our net income may fluctuate as the yield curve between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies  and as the differences between us treasury rates  the th district cost of funds rate cofi  and libor rates vary 
at december   we owned billion of adjustable rate mortgage assets with interest rates that adjust every six months as a function of six month libor interest rates funded with equity and with debt that had an interest rate that adjusts monthly as a function of one month libor interest rates 
adjustable rate assets with earnings rates dependent on one year us treasury rates with annual adjustments totaled billion at december  these treasury based assets were effectively funded with equity and with billion of liabilities with a cost of funds dependent on one year us treasury rates with annual adjustments 
the remainder of the liabilities associated with these assets had a cost of funds dependent on one month libor rates or the daily fed funds rate 
at december   we owned a total of million of fixed rate assets funded  in part  with short term variable rate debt which is only partially hedged 
holding these positions should mitigate earnings declines caused by lower yields on equity funded assets as interest rates fall 
as interest rates rise  net earnings on these assets should fall  but this would likely be offset  in part  by the beneficial effect of higher yields on equity funded assets 
interest rates and related factors can affect our spread income and our mark to market results 
changes in interest rates also affect prepayment rates see below and influence other factors that may affect our results 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt 
even if the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are well matched  maturities may not be matched 
in addition  trends in the liquidity of the us capital markets in general may affect our ability to rollover short term debt 
at december   we had billion of short term debt 
prepayment risk at december   mortgage premium balances were million 
most of this premium  million  was associated with our residential retained loan portfolio  and the rest  million  with our investment portfolio 
total mortgage discount balances were million  primarily all of which was associated with our credit enhancement portfolio 
of this total discount amount  we are currently amortizing million into income over time in a manner dependent on mortgage prepayment rates 
the remainder  million  we have designated as a credit reserve to provide for future losses 
we will realize this portion of our discount as income only if future credit losses are less than projected 
our net premium balance for our whole balance sheet  after removing the designated credit reserve  was million 
credit risk our principal credit risk comes from residential mortgage loans in our retained portfolio and credit enhancement portfolio and from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
a small amount of our investment portfolio is currently exposed to credit risk  the bulk of this portfolio has very high credit ratings and would not normally be expected to incur credit losses 
we have credit risk with counter parties with whom we do business 
it should be noted that the establishment of a credit reserve for gaap purposes for our residential retained portfolio or a designated credit reserve under the effective yield method for our credit enhancement portfolio does not reduce our taxable income or our dividend payment obligations as a reit 
for taxable income  many of our credit expenses will be recognized only as incurred 
thus  the timing of recognition of credit losses for gaap and tax  and for our earnings and our dividends  may differ 
the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our credit enhancement portfolio  we effectively are provided with a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets 
we designate a portion of our discount as a credit reserve 
in addition  first loss and other credit enhancement interests that are junior to our positions that we do not own act as a form of credit reserve for us on a specific asset basis 
for our retained residential mortgage loan portfolio  we establish a credit reserve based on anticipation of losses 
for our investment portfolio  most of the assets do not have material credit risk  and no credit reserves are generally established 
when we acquire any assets for this portfolio where credit risk exists  we will establish the appropriate reserve as necessary 
for our commercial retained portfolio  we take credit reserves on a specific asset basis when specific circumstances may warrant such a charge for a particular loan 
management constantly monitors the performance of all of its assets and takes appropriate actions to mitigate potential losses to the extent possible 
regardless of how we account for future credit loss expectations  there can be no assurance that our estimates will be prove to be correct  and thus we may need to adjust the amounts of credit reserves we have established 
capital risk our capital levels  and thus our access to borrowings and liquidity  may be tested  particularly if the market value of our assets securing short term borrowings declines 
through our risk adjusted capital policy  we assign a guideline capital adequacy amount  expressed as a guideline equity to assets ratio  to each of our mortgage assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio will fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by our collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for residential mortgage securities rated below aa  residential credit enhancement interests  retained interests from our sequoia securitizations of our residential retained portfolio assets  and commercial mortgage whole loans are generally higher than for higher rated residential securities and residential whole loans 
capital requirements for these less liquid assets depend chiefly on our access to secure funding for these assets  the number of sources of such funding  the funding terms  and on the amount of extra capital we decide to hold on hand to protect against possible liquidity events with these assets 
capital requirements for most of our retained interests in sequoia generally equal our net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of our mortgage assets is our aggregate capital adequacy guideline amount 
generally  our total guideline equity to assets ratio capital amount has declined over the last few years as we have eliminated some of the risks of short term debt funding through issuing long term debt 
in the most recent quarters  however  the guideline ratio has increased as we have acquired new types of assets requiring more capital  such as commercial mortgage loans and residential credit enhancement interests 
we do not expect that our actual capital levels will always exceed the guideline amount 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  our capital guideline amount may rise  as the potential interest rate risk of our mortgages would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps and slowing prepayment rates 
we measure all of our mortgage assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
our actual capital levels  as determined for the risk adjusted capital policy  would likely fall as rates increase as the market values of our mortgages  net of mark to market gains on hedges  decreased 
such market value declines may be temporary as well  as future coupon adjustments on adjustable rate mortgage loans may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which our actual capital levels decreased below our capital adequacy guideline amount  we would generally cease the acquisition of new mortgage assets until capital balance was restored through prepayments  interest rate changes  or other means 
in certain cases prior to a planned equity offering or other circumstances  the board of directors has authorized management to acquire mortgage assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of our risk adjusted capital policy 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends must equal at least for years and after of our net income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
quantitative information about market risk the information presented in the table on the following pages includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets  fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities and also utilize interest rate sensitive derivative financial instruments 
we designate some of these assets as trading 
the designation of an asset as trading does not necessarily imply that we have a short term intended holding period for that asset 
the table below includes information about the possible future repayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities and constitutes a forward looking statement 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as assumed 
other events will occur and will affect the outcomes 
furthermore  future sales  acquisitions  calls  and restructurings could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average interest rates for each year  based on the existing characteristics of the portfolio 
the maturity of cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance  actual prepayment speeds will vary
