item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunications and internet services in major population centers throughout russia  ukraine and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states cis 
we organize our operations into four business groups  as follows competitive local exchange carrier clec services  using local access overlay networks in moscow  kiev and st 
petersburg  long distance services using a fiber optic and satellite based network  data and internet services  using a fiber optic and satellite based networks with more than points of presence in russia and the cis 
our data and internet services product portfolio is currently comprised of a business to business services  such as data communications  dedicated internet access  web design  web hosting  co location and data warehousing and b business to consumer services  such as dial up internet access  web content and a family of internet portals  and mobile services using mobile networks in kiev and odessa  ukraine 
additionally  we hold a minority interest in mct corp 
mct  which in turn has ownership interests in twenty four mobile operations located throughout russia and in uzbekistan and tajikistan 
we treat our ownership interest in mct as an investment and are not actively involved in the day to day management of the operations 
most of our revenue is derived from high volume business customers and carriers 
our business customers include large multinational companies  local enterprises  financial institutions  hotels and government agencies 
we believe that the carriers  including mobile operators  which contribute a substantial portion of our revenues  in turn derive a portion of their business from high volume business customers 
thus  we believe that the majority of our ultimate end users are businesses that require access to highly reliable and advanced telecommunications facilities to sustain their operations 
in the aftermath of the august russian financial crisis  a significant number of our business customers scaled back or closed their operations in russia  and many local companies closed down operations in russia because of an inability to satisfy their payment obligations to creditors  including us 
terminations of service and reduction in services reduced our recurring revenues during the period following the crisis 
additionally  sales of equipment declined significantly  as new customers preferred to lease rather than buy equipment under those market conditions 
we also experienced and continue to experience significant price pressure on our recurring revenue  applied particularly by moscow cellular operators  which include some of our largest customers 
we have traditionally competed for customers on the basis of network quality  customer service and range of service offered 
in the past several years  other telecommunications operators have also introduced high quality services to the segments of the business market in which we operate 
competition with these operators has intensified in the last several quarters  resulting in declining prices  which adversely affected our revenues 
in addition  some of our competitors do not link their prices to the dollar ruble exchange rate  so when the ruble devalues  their prices effectively become lower than our prices 
in order to compete with these carriers in the regions outside moscow and st 
petersburg  we were forced to lower our tariffs  which resulted in reduced revenues and reduced margins 
since the ruble exchange rate with the dollar has become relatively stable during  price pressures associated with devaluation have eased considerably 
we cannot be certain that the exchange rate will remain stable in the future 
since early  we appear to have witnessed a recovery in the russian market  but with downward pricing pressures persisting  both because of competitive pressures in russia and because of a global trend toward lower telecommunications tariffs 
in late and early  the increases in traffic volume did not keep pace with the reduction in prices 
however  in recent months our volume increases are beginning to exceed the reduction in tariffs on certain types of voice traffic 
this is a contributory factor to the increase in our quarterly revenue during we expect that this trend will continue as long as there are improvements in the russian economy 
although we expect competition to continue to force the general level of tariffs downward  we expect to mitigate partially the effects of this pressure by seeking  where possible  further reductions in the settlement and interconnection rates that we pay to other telecommunications operators 
our ability to reduce our cost of revenue by reducing these payments has enabled us  on most types of traffic to maintain  or even improve  our margins 
in general  we expect settlement and interconnection rates to continue to decline in line with tariffs 
we intend to incrementally expand the fiber optic capacity along our heavy traffic and high cost routes to reduce our unit transmission costs and ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for internet and data services 
as part of this strategy  during  we acquired the rights to use up to stm fiber optic capacity on the moscow to stockholm route  significantly reducing our unit cost per e fiber optic link on this route 
in addition to the traditional voice and data service provision  we are actively pursuing a strategy of developing non traditional telecom service offerings including those related to the internet  such as web hosting  web design  and vertical and horizontal internet portal development 
to this end  we have acquired infoart stars and the agama family of web properties to add to our russia on line internet portal  which also incorporates some of our other acquisitions  referat 
ru  absolute games and fintek 
we have seen a significant increase in our dial up internet subscriber numbers and we expect the increase to continue  albeit with an increasing emphasis on regional subscribers  as additional dialup capacity in moscow is not readily available 
together  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues for year ended december  our largest customer  vimpelcom  together with its affiliate kb impulse  accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  no other customer  except for sovintel  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues  accounted for over of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  we provide services to our largest customers  including vimpelcom and sovintel  pursuant to agreements which specify the services we must maintain for these customers and the tariffs that we charge for these services

in december  we acquired an ownership interest in mct in exchange for our ownership of vostok mobile bv  a netherlands registered private limited holding company that owns our russian mobile operations  including our abandoned ventures 
initially  we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of mct and we expect to be later diluted to not less than as a result of subsequent equity offerings to be undertaken by mct 
as part of the transaction  we also purchased for cash million of mct debt convertible into its equity securities 
at december  we owned approximately of mct 
the acquisition of the equity interest in mct  effectively completes a major part of the formal plan of restructuring  that we initiated when we abandoned certain mobile business operations in russia  as approved by the board of directors of gts in the third quarter of as part of this plan of restructuring  we had been seeking to dispose of our ownership interests in certain mobile operations in russia and we did not intend to provide any additional financial assistance to such businesses  other than debts assumed 
we took a charge to earnings of million in the third quarter of  of which approximately million was recorded as a liability 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge and liability of million relating to the cancellation of certain network capacity 
there were no amounts charged against these liabilities in the year ended december  there was million recorded against these liabilities during these charges resulted from a western owned financial institution attaching the collateral held in regard to a debt facility between the financial institution and the mobile ventures  and the disposition costs and cancellation of certain network capacity 
we accounted for the exchange of our subsidiary vostok mobile bv for an equity interest of approximately in mct at book value since the related fair values were not readily determinable  accordingly  no gain or loss was recognized 
concurrent with the exchange of ownership interests  certain assets and our rights to certain obligations of our russian mobile ventures were assigned to mct 
prior to the transaction the book value of our interest was adjusted for the effect of the concurrent transactions and the remaining portion of the abandonment and restructuring reserve

as the result of our acquisitions in and the prior years we acquired significant intangible assets  including goodwill 
goodwill is amortized over five years and the majority of our intangible assets are amortized over the same period 
we continue to apply the appropriate assessments of the book value of these assets 
results of operations golden telecom  inc was formed in june to be the holding company for all of gts s businesses in the commonwealth of independent states 
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared as if golden telecom  inc had been in existence throughout and in addition  we have included a discussion of edn sovintel llc  our primary non consolidated operation  which entity is material to our business 
we believe that this discussion is helpful to develop an understanding of the factors contributing to our overall financial condition and results of operations

revenue from clec services decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the clec services division of teleross revenue decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is mainly due to a reduction in monthly fees and a decrease in traffic related revenue  largely as a result of pricing concessions made to our largest customer 
the clec services division of golden telecom bts revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was mainly due to increased traffic revenue from end users and other carriers  partially offset by reduced tariffs 
data and internet services 
revenue from data and internet services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is largely the result of increases in internet revenue from both dial up and dedicated subscribers 
the significant increase in dial up internet subscribers and revenue has been achieved primarily through organic growth and through the acquisitions of glasnet  nevalink and commercial information networks kis

this decrease was primarily due to lower turnover taxes as a result of decreased revenue together with a reduction in the bad debt expense 
income taxes our effective rate of income tax differs from the us statutory rate due to the impact of the following factors different income tax rates and regulations apply in the countries where we operate  amortization of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes  and in the year ended december  we recorded a million abandonment and restructuring charge that was not deductible for income tax purposes

at december  investments available for sale were million 
our total restricted cash was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
the decrease in the amount of restricted cash was largely due to the effects of the exchange of vostok mobile bv for the equity interest in mct corp

during the twelve months ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities 
during the twelve months ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities

the lease has an initial term of ten years with an option to renew for an additional five years 
full prepayments were made to the lessor in april and august these prepayments have been offset against the lease obligation in the financial statements of the company 
some of our operating companies have received debt financing through direct loans from affiliated companies 
in addition  certain operating companies have borrowed funds under a million back to back  seven year credit facility from a western owned bank licensed to operate in russia 
under this facility  we provide full cash collateral  held in london and recorded on our balance sheet as restricted cash  for onshore loans made by the bank to our russian registered joint ventures

golden telecom ukraine entered into a year supplier loan agreement with siemens ag siemens loan agreement whereby siemens ag provided to golden telecom ukraine a loan of million for the purchase from siemens ag of network equipment and services for use in the gsm network in odessa  ukraine  deployed in the third quarter of in accordance with the terms of the siemens loan agreement  golden telecom ukraine is required to make eight semi annual payments plus accrued interest beginning may  the agreement carries interest at a rate equal to the six month united states dollar libor plus 
the siemens loan agreement became effective with the execution of a payment guarantee by golden telecom  inc in october in order for us to compete successfully  we will require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations and ventures  including losses from operations 
we will also require capital for our acquisition and business development initiatives 
the net proceeds from our ipo and our private placement will be applied to these funding requirements 
we also expect to fund these requirements through our cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings that we may conduct  and debt financing facilities 
in the future  we may execute especially large or numerous acquisitions  inside and outside of the cis  which may require us to raise additional funds through a dilutive equity issuance  through additional borrowings with collateralization and through the divestment of non core assets  or combination of the above 
in the case these especially large or numerous acquisitions do not materialize  we expect our current sources of funding  including the net proceeds from our ipo and the related investment  to finance our capital requirements for the next to months 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates because of changes and fluctuations in our anticipated acquisitions  investments  revenue  operating costs and network expansion plans and access to alternative sources of financing on favorable terms 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
as a result  we may be subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants  our interest obligations may increase significantly and our shareholders may be adversely diluted 
our failure to generate sufficient funds in the future  whether from operations or by raising additional debt or equity capital  may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our anticipated expenditures  to sell assets  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
although we have achieved positive cash flow from operations  we cannot assure you that our operations will sustain positive operating cash flow or achieve operating profitability in the future 
if we cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations or working capital requirements  and the value of our shares of common stock may decline

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and treasury and currency exposure management our treasury function has managed our funding  liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our investment treasury operations are conducted within guidelines that have been established and authorized by our audit committee 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any treasury management transactions of a speculative nature 
the ruble and the hryvna are generally non convertible outside russia and ukraine  respectively  so our ability to hedge against further devaluation by converting to other currencies is significantly limited 
further  our ability to convert rubles and hryvna into other currencies in russia and ukraine  respectively  is subject to rules that restrict the purposes for which conversion and the payment of foreign currencies are allowed 
given that much of our operating costs are indexed to or denominated in us dollars  including employee compensation expense  capital expenditure and interest expense  we have taken specific steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the appropriate foreign currency 
although local currency control regulations require us to collect virtually all of our revenue in local currency  certain ventures generally either price or invoice in us dollars or index their invoices and collections to the applicable dollar exchange rate 
customer contracts may include clauses allowing additional invoicing if the applicable exchange rate changes significantly between the invoice date and the date of payment  favorable terms for early or pre payments and heavy penalty clauses for overdue payments 
maintaining the dollar value of our revenue subjects us to additional tax on exchange gains 
although we are attempting to match revenue  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our cash and cash equivalents are held largely in interest bearing accounts  in us dollars  however we do have bank accounts denominated in russian rubles and ukrainian hryvna

we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign currency exchange rate risk and we also periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign currency exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
fair value of our debt obligations at december  and  approximates total value
