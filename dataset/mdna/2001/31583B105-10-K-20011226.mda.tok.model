the bank uses underwriting and construction loan guidelines for financing primarily individual  owner occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved 
construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase or to be paid off upon receiving financing from another financial institution 
construction loans are based on the appraised value of the property  as determined by an independent appraiser  and an analysis of the potential marketability and profitability of the project 
construction loans generally have terms of up to months  with extensions as needed 
loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant 
construction loans afford the bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on arm loans secured by existing residential properties 
these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending 
construction development loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result of the foregoing  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of  and accrued interest on  the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  the bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time

delinquencies and classified assets 
delinquent loans 
the board of directors performs a monthly review of all delinquent loans 
the procedures taken by the bank with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency 
the bank s policies generally provide that delinquent mortgage loans be reviewed and that a written late charge notice be mailed no later than the twentieth day of delinquency 
the policies also require telephone contacts for loans more than days late to ascertain the reasons for the delinquency and the prospects of repayment 
face to face interviews and collection notices are generally required for loans more than days delinquent and on a case by case basis for mortgage loans 
after days  the bank will either set a date by which the loan must be brought current  enter into a written forbearance agreement  foreclose on any collateral or take other appropriate action 
the bank s policies regarding delinquent consumer loans are similar except that telephone contacts and correspondence will generally occur after a consumer loan is more than days delinquent 
it is the bank s general policy to discontinue the accrual of interest on all first mortgage loans days past due 
consumer loans continue to accrue interest until a determination is made by the bank that the loan may result in a loss 
property acquired by the bank as a result of a foreclosure on a mortgage loan is classified as real estate owned and is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance or fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value

federal regulations require the bank to classify loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities  considered by the ots to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
the bank s classification policies provide that assets will be classified according to ots regulations 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are required to be designated special mention by management 
when the bank determines that an asset should be classified  it generally does not establish a specific allowance for such asset unless it determines that such asset may result in a loss 
the bank however  establishes valuation allowances in amounts deemed prudent for the pools of classified assets 
valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize probable losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
the bank s policies provide for the establishment of a specific allowance equal to of each asset classified as loss or to charge off such amount 
a savings institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews the problem loans in its portfolio on a monthly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations  and believes its classification policies are consistent with ots policies 
as of september   the bank had classified assets of  classified loans of  were categorized as substandard  consisting of residential mortgage loans and auto loans 
there were no assets classified as doubtful 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan and lease losses based on management s evaluation of probable incurred credit losses in its loan portfolio 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collection may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  peer group information and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
although the bank maintains its allowance at a level which it considers adequate to provide for probable losses  there can be no assurances that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts

the following table sets forth the company s allocation of its allowance for loan losses 
this allocation is based on management s subjective estimates 
the amount allocated to a particular category should not be interpreted as the only amount available for future charge offs that may occur within that category  it may not be indicative of future charge off trends and it may change from year to year based on management s assessment of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio

as of september   the bank qualified as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code and met the qualified thrift lender test 
qualified thrift lender test the hola requires every savings association to satisfy a qualified thrift lender qtl test 
under the hola  a savings association will be deemed to meet the qtl test if it either i maintains at least of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments on a monthly basis in nine out of every months or ii qualifies as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code 
for purposes of the qtl test  qualified thrift investments consist of mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  education loans  small business loans  credit card loans and certain other housing and consumer related loans and investments 
portfolio assets consist of a savings association s total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets  the association s business properties and a limited amount of the liquid assets maintained by the association pursuant to ots requirements 
a savings association that fails to meet the qtl test must either convert to a bank charter or operate under certain restrictions on its operations and activities 
additionally  within one year following the loss of qtl status  the holding company for the savings association will be required to register as  and will be deemed to be  a bank holding company 
a savings association that fails the qtl test may requalify as a qtl but it may do so only once 
as of september   the bank satisfied the qtl test  with a ratio of qualified thrift investments to portfolio assets of  and qualified as a domestic building and loan association  as defined in the internal revenue code 
liquidity requirements the ots issued a final rule  effective july   eliminating the requirement that each savings association maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets of at least of its liquidity base 
the change was made to implement a recent change to the hola 
the rule  nevertheless  requires each savings association and service corporation to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation 
federal reserve system federal reserve regulations  as presently in effect  require depository institutions to maintain non interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts  as follows for transaction accounts aggregating million or less  the reserve requirement is of total transaction accounts  and for transaction accounts aggregating in excess of million  the reserve requirement is million plus of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the first million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements 
these reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the federal reserve 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing requirements 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the federal reserve board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the ots requires all regulated thrift institutions to calculate the estimated change in the bank s net portfolio value npv assuming instantaneous  parallel shifts in the treasury yield curve of to basis points either up or down in basis point increments 
the npv is defined as the present value of expected cash flows from existing assets less the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of net expected cash inflows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the ots provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule cmr as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the ots simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the ots model estimates the economics value of each type of asset  liability  and off balance sheet contact under the assumption that the treasury yield curve shifts instantaneously and parallel up and down to basis points in basis point increments 
the ots provides thrifts the results of their interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information provided by the bank  to estimate the sensitivity of npv 
the ots model utilizes an option based pricing approach to estimate the sensitivity of mortgage loans 
the most significant embedded option in these types of assets is the prepayment option of the borrowers 
the ots model uses various price indications and prepayment assumptions to estimate sensitivity of mortgage loans 
in the ots model  the value of deposit accounts appears on the asset and liability side of the npv analysis 
in estimating the value of certificate of deposit accounts  the liability portion of the cd is represented by the implied value when comparing the difference between the cd face rate and available wholesale cd rates 
on the asset side of the npv calculation  the value of the customer relationship due to the rollover of retail cd deposits represents an intangible asset in the npv calculation 
other deposit accounts such as transaction accounts  money market deposit accounts  passbook accounts  and non interest bearing accounts also are included on the asset and liability side of the npv calculation in the ots model 
the accounts are valued at of the respective account balances on the liability side 
on the assets side of the analysis  the value of the customer relationship of the various types of deposit accounts is reflected as a deposit intangible 
the npv sensitivity of borrowed funds is estimated by the ots model based on a discounted cash flow approach 
the cash flows are assumed to consist of monthly interest payments with principal paid at maturity 
the ots model is based only on the bank s balance sheet 
the assets and liabilities at the parent company level are short term in nature  primarily cash and equivalents  and were not considered in the analysis because they would not have a material effect on the analysis of npv sensitivity 
the following table sets forth the company s september  interest rate sensitivity of npv  the most recent available from the ots
