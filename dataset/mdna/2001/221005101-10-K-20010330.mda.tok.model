item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from what is discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed above under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that address large markets  including cardiovascular disease  stroke and cancer 
we currently have two product candidates in phase ii clinical trials 
one of our lead product candidates  partnered with pfizer  is uk  formerly rnif  a recombinant protein in phase iib clinical trials for the treatment of reperfusion injury associated with ischemic stroke 
our other lead product candidate  known as rnapc  is a recombinant protein that we are developing for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism  and for the treatment of unstable angina 
we have completed a successful phase ii clinical trial for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and  subject to government regulations  plan to initiate a phase iii clinical trial for this indication in the second half of we also have a number of research programs aimed at discovering novel drugs to modulate proteases involved in cancer and other diseases 
we currently have no products for sale and are focused on research and development and clinical trial activities 
we have not been profitable on an annual basis since inception and we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as we progress in our research and development programs 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities  payments received from collaborators and interest income 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect that our sources of revenue  if any  for the next several years will continue to primarily consist of payments under collaborative agreements and interest income 
however  we do not expect to record any revenue under any of our existing collaborative agreements in the process of developing our product candidates will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval activities 
in particular  if we initiate phase iii clinical trials for rnapc  either independently or with a collaborator  we expect that our research and development expenses will increase significantly 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
results of operations revenues 
our total operating revenues in decreased to million from million in and million in revenues from collaborative agreements in  which decreased by million from the amount  included million related to our agreement with schering plough for the discovery and commercialization of an oral anticoagulant for chronic thrombosis and  related to our agreement with schering plough for the design and development of an oral inhibitor of a key protease associated with hepatitis c virus replication 
a million license fee received from schering plough for the hepatitis c inhibitor program was also recognized in research grant revenues of  were recognized in in connection with our research and development activities for our malaria research program 
revenues from collaborative agreements in  which decreased by  from  included i million related to our oral anticoagulant agreement with schering plough  ii million related to our hepatitis c agreement with schering plough  iii  related to the now terminated research and development agreement with vascular genomics inc  or vgi  and iv  related to our license and development agreement with pfizer to collaborate on the development of uk  we did not recognize any license fees or milestone payments in  compared to million in furthermore  because we discontinued tissue factor manufacturing in  we had no product sales in  compared to  in we were awarded a government grant in september to fund our malaria research program  which resulted in revenues of  in the year  we do not expect to receive any research and development funding or other revenues under our agreements with schering plough 
in the event that we enter into new collaborative agreements  we may recognize related revenue  however  we cannot predict whether we will enter into new collaborative agreements during even if we do enter into new collaborative agreements  we may not recognize revenue under these agreements in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  which accounted for of our total costs and expenses in  in and in  increased to million in from million in this  increase was primarily attributable to increased clinical development costs for rnapc research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was due to a lower headcount in compared to  and the termination of the option and related research and development agreements with vgi 
we are in the process of expanding our cancer research programs and intend to hire additional employees to perform research on these programs 
we also plan to hire additional employees to support our rnapc development activities 
in addition  we expect our expenses will increase due to the manufacturing of clinical supplies of rnapc in anticipation of a phase iii clinical trial planned to begin in the second half of therefore  we anticipate that our research and development expenses in will be substantially higher than our expenses in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this million decrease was due to settlement costs associated with the termination of the vgi program in  a portion of which was offset by increased business development expenses in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to settlement costs associated with vgi 
we recently hired a vice president  corporate development and expect our general and administrative expenses in to increase over the amounts spent in net other income 
net other income was million in   in and million in the largest component each year has been interest income  which has fluctuated based on varying cash balances available for investment 
in  we had interest income of million and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in the increase in interest income in was due  in part  to the cash we received in connection with our public offering of common stock completed in november interest expense was attributable to the convertible senior subordinated notes  in an aggregate principal amount of million  that were issued in and are due in august in addition to interest income of million  the amount also included  from the sale of some equipment and materials to a johnson johnson subsidiary in connection with the transfer of tissue factor manufacturing 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through public offerings and private placements of our debt and equity securities  payments received through our collaborative agreements  and interest income earned on cash and investment balances 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  time deposits and debt securities  which  net of a  restricted time deposit  totaled million as of december  working capital was million at december  in november  we completed a public offering of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we invest available cash in accordance with an investment policy set by our board of directors  which has established objectives to preserve principal  maintain adequate liquidity and maximize income 
our policy provides guidelines concerning the quality  term and liquidity of investments 
we presently invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of corporations with strong credit ratings and government backed debt obligations 
during the year ended december   net cash of million was used in operating activities and net cash of million was used in investing activities 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities  most of which was attributable to the completion of our public offering of  shares of common stock 
other cash provided by financing activities included aggregate net proceeds of million from the exercise of outstanding warrants and million from stock option exercises 
in august and october of we issued and sold  in two private financings  a total of  shares of our common stock for per share and convertible senior subordinated notes due in august  in an aggregate principal amount of million 
net proceeds of million were raised in these financings 
at the option of the note holder  the principal balance of both notes is convertible into shares of our common stock at per share  subject to certain adjustments 
interest on the outstanding principal amounts of these notes accretes at per annum  compounded semi annually  with interest payable upon redemption or conversion 
upon maturity  these notes will have an accreted value of million 
at our option  the accreted interest portion of both notes may be paid in cash or in our common stock priced at the then current market price 
we have agreed to pay any applicable withholding taxes on behalf of the note holder that may be incurred in connection with the accreted interest  which are estimated and accrued at of the annual accretion 
we may redeem the notes any time after august  upon payment of the outstanding principal and accreted interest 
in april  we entered into an exclusive license and development agreement with pfizer to collaborate on the development of uk  an anti inflammatory agent with therapeutic potential for stroke and other indications 
pfizer received an exclusive worldwide license to further develop  commercialize and market uk  as a therapeutic agent  and funded our internal research and development over a two year period that ended march  pfizer is responsible for funding all further development of uk  to date  we have received million from pfizer under this agreement  and we may receive up to an additional million under this agreement if all future milestones are achieved 
however  we do not anticipate receiving any payments under this agreement in and we cannot assure you that any future milestones will be reached or that we will ever receive any additional payments under this agreement 
we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on clinical trial progress  submissions for specified regulatory approvals and commercialization events 
if pfizer commercializes a product candidate covered by this agreement  we will also be entitled to receive royalties on product sales 
we also have two independent collaborations with schering plough  one for the design and development of an oral inhibitor of a key protease associated with hepatitis c virus replication and the other for the discovery and commercialization of an oral anticoagulant for chronic thrombosis 
our collaboration with schering plough for the development of treatments for hepatitis c commenced in june in may  we amended our original agreement and licensed selected patents and other intellectual property relating to a key protease associated with hepatitis c virus replication to schering plough in consideration for a lump sum payment of million and the right to receive royalties on product sales  if any 
schering plough is now responsible for conducting all further research and development  if any 
we are entitled to royalties based on products developed by schering plough for the treatment of hepatitis c  whether or not such a product incorporates technology licensed from us 
however  our royalties will be lower if any product that is developed is not based on our technology 
we have no further responsibility under this agreement and we are not entitled to any milestone payments 
our second collaboration with schering plough is to identify an anticoagulant that can be taken in pill form 
under this collaboration  which commenced in december  schering plough funded our internal research and development through december  schering plough is now responsible for conducting all further research and development  if any 
unless schering plough selects a clinical candidate  we will not receive any additional revenues under this collaboration 
we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on clinical trial progress  specified regulatory submissions and approvals and commercialization events  however  these will only be received in the event schering plough selects a clinical candidate 
if schering plough commercializes a product candidate covered by this agreement  we will also be entitled to receive royalties on product sales  if any 
we cannot assure you that existing collaborations will be successful  that we will receive any future milestones or other payments related to our agreements  or that our collaborations will continue 
we will continue to incur substantial additional costs in the foreseeable future due to  among other factors  costs related to ongoing and planned clinical trial activities and other research and development activities 
specifically  in the first half of we expect research and development expenses to increase over historical amounts due to the scheduled manufacturing of clinical supplies for rnapc in anticipation of a phase iii clinical trial planned to begin in the second half of in addition  we expect research and development expenses related to our cancer programs to increase throughout over the next several years  we expect our costs will result in additional operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
based on our currently expected burn rate for  which is estimated to be between million and million  we believe that our existing capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated funding requirements for at least the next two years 
however  this is just an estimate and this estimate assumes that we are successful in consummating a collaborative agreement for rnapc our future burn rate and capital requirements will also be impacted by many other factors  including o the progress on and scope of our cancer programs and other internally funded research and development o the timing and magnitude of expenses incurred to further develop rnapc o the success of our collaborators in developing and marketing products under their respective collaborations with us o competing technological and market developments o the costs we incur in obtaining and enforcing patent and other proprietary rights or gaining the freedom to operate under the patents of others o our success in acquiring and integrating complementary products  technologies or companies in the future  we may also receive additional funds from milestone payments and royalties on sales of products in connection with our agreements 
however  we may not receive any additional amounts under our existing or any future agreements  and we may not be successful in raising additional capital through strategic or other financings or through collaborative relationships 
additionally  our expected cash requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated 
our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income at december  were approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes  and begin to expire in the net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes  which expire five to ten years after generation  are approximately million 
we also had unused research and development tax credits for federal income tax reporting purposes of million at december  in accordance with internal revenue code section  the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits existing prior to a change in control may be limited 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  addresses the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
 as amended  will not have an impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in accordance with our investment policy  we do not invest in derivative financial instruments or any other market risk sensitive instruments 
our available cash is invested in short term  high quality fixed income investments that are held to maturity 
see note of the notes to financial statements for information about these financial instruments 
we believe that our interest rate market risk is limited  and that we are not exposed to significant changes in fair value because our investments are held to maturity 
the fair value of each investment approximates its amortized cost due to the recent purchases of these instruments 
for purposes of measuring interest rate sensitivity  we have assumed that the similar nature of our investments warrants aggregation 
the carrying amount of all held to maturity investments as of december  is million  they have a weighted average interest rate of 
considering our investment balances as of december   rates of return and the fixed rate nature of the convertible notes payable that were issued in the second half of  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
since the million aggregate principal of the convertible senior subordinated notes that we issued is convertible into common stock at per share at the option of the holder  there is underlying market risk related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates that may make conversion of these notes into common stock beneficial to the holder 
conversion of these convertible senior subordinated notes will have a dilutive effect on our common stock
