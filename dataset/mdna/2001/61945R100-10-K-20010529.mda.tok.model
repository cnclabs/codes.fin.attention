the value of such deferred payment obligations varies with the market price of the underlying metals on which the loan is based  and is reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company and jm ney are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  primarily those of precious metals  from changes in interest rates  and from factors that affect equity investments in russia and the ukraine 
foreign investment risk the company has one ukraine based common stock investment with a net reported value at february  of  and a longer term indirect investment in comcor tv  a russian cable television and internet company  through its investment in moscow broadband  with a reported value of  in addition  jm ney has an investment in a bond fund with a reported value of  the realizable value of the trading investments is subject to currency fluctuations  illiquid markets and political risks 
the company has no derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with these investments 
the company s investment in moscow broadband is also at risk based upon moscow broadband s ability to raise sufficient equity capital at appropriate values to enable it to provide comcor tv additional equity capital in order for moscow broadband to maintain its equity share in comcor tv 
additionally  the degree of success of comcor tv to add sufficient subscribers for its cable television and internet access services at adequate rates  and for comcor tv to obtain sufficient equity and debt financing to fund its infrastructure build out and near term projected operating losses  will also significantly affect the value of the company s investment in moscow broadband 
commodity price risk jm ney utilizes significant amounts of precious metals in the products it manufactures and sells 
significant increases in the market value of these metals  palladium  gold and platinum  in particular  may affect the demand for its products 
jm ney generally adjusts the selling prices of its products if market prices change significantly  or it utilizes derivative instruments for fixed price sales commitments 
accordingly  while a change in precious metals prices may affect cost of sales  such impact is generally met with an approximately equivalent change in sales  so that the impact on earnings is minimal or not present 
significant fluctuations and volatility in precious metal price creates risk that purchases of precious metals may not be efficiently coordinated with sales 
while jm ney believes it has the programs in place to limit this risk  there can be no assurance that volatility in price does not result in unintended profits or losses 
also  while increases or decreases in precious metal prices affect the economic value of jm ney s inventory  such changes are generally reflected through a corresponding change in the lifo reserve and do not affect the net reported value of its inventory 
the economic exposures to changing precious metals prices of jm ney s inventory are generally not hedged 
changes in the prices of commodities being borrowed under consignment lease or deferred payment borrowing arrangements can significantly affect jm ney s cost of sales and its interest costs  as interest on these arrangements is charged based upon the market value of the underlying metal and the lease rate for that metal 
lease rates for palladium have fluctuated significantly in each of the last three fiscal years 
at february   there were no outstanding precious metals leases or deferred payment borrowings of precious metals 
interest rate risk jm ney has a revolving line of credit which bears interest at floating rates as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
neither the company nor jm ney hedges its interest rate risk 
based upon jm ney s year end balances  a change in interest rates would affect its interest cost of its short term cash borrowings by approximately  during fy the leasing rates and market prices for palladium fluctuated significantly due to the volatility in the market price for palladium  leasing costs ranged from a high of per annum to a low of  with an unweighted average of approximately 
market prices for palladium contracts ranged from per troy ounce to  per troy ounce 
at february   jm ney had no precious metal borrowings under consignment or deferred pricing contracts
