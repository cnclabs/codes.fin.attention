item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  among other things  statements regarding our anticipated product offerings  customer and geographic revenue mix  gross margins and operating costs and expenses 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed in other factors affecting future operations and elsewhere in this form k report 
overview we were incorporated in december we were engaged principally in research and development from inception through september  when we began volume shipments of our first voice communications product  the soundstation 
currently  our voice communications products consist principally of the soundstation  soundstation ex  soundstation premier  soundstation premier ex  soundpoint and soundpoint pro 
in january  we completed the acquisition of viavideo  a development stage company that designed and developed high quality  low cost  easy to use  group video communications systems 
in february  we began customer shipments of the viewstation product family  our video communications equipment product line 
currently  our video communications products consist principally of the viewstation  viewstation  viewstation v  viewstation mp  viewstation sp  viewstation fx  vs and viavideo 
in december  we acquired atlas communication engines  inc  a privately held  oem supplier of iads  and an emerging supplier of dsl routers 
in addition  atlas also sold non dsl custom communications products under oem arrangements 
atlas line of iads and dsl routers  which have become our network access product line  provides voice and data over the rapidly growing dsl network 
through december   we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from sales of our viewstation  network access and soundstation products 
we anticipate that the viewstation  netengine and soundstation products will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues at least for the next twelve months 
any factor adversely affecting the demand or supply for these products would harm our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statement of income data for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition costs litigation reserve release total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other investments adjustment other expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenues net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the same period of this increase was due primarily to an increased sales volume of our video communication products which accounted for of the total increase 
in addition  sales volume increases in our network access and voice communication products also contributed to the improvement over the increase in voice communications revenue accounted for of the total increase and the increase in network access products accounted for of the total increase 
we also had a significant increase in sales in each international region in over due to an increased focus on expanding into foreign markets 
this expansion included adding sales and marketing  operational and administrative resources 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the same period of this was due primarily to sales volume increases in our video communications products which accounted for of the total increase 
these products began shipping in february of and we have added various models since that time 
additionally  voice communications products sales volume increases also contributed to the revenue growth and accounted for the remaining of the total increase 
although a majority of our revenue growth was from north america  we also experienced growth in net revenues in europe due to our increase in investment in this region in a major contributor to the expected growth of the broadband distribution market has been the deployment of digital subscriber lines  or dsl 
beginning in the second half of  some dsl providers experienced delays in delivering their service which caused financial troubles for these companies 
these dsl providers are customers of our network access products through oem providers we use as resellers 
these service delays slowed the expected growth in this market which in turn slowed sales of our network access products 
if these conditions persist  they will negatively impact revenues from our network access products 
in  and  we derived a substantial majority of our net revenues from sales of our video communication  voice communication and network access products 
no customer accounted for more than of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended december  however  one customer  lucent technologies  accounted for of our net revenues in the three months ended december   primarily from sales of our network access products 
in addition  lucent technologies accounted for of net revenues in both and if  for any reason  lucent technologies reduced their purchases of our products  it would harm our business 
no other customer or reseller accounted for more than of our net revenues during these periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for business segment information 
our business is subject to the risks arising from domestic and global economic conditions 
recently  economic growth in the unites states has slowed to the point where industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to predict 
if our customers delay ordering our products we will fall short of our revenue expectations for any given quarter in or for the entire year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and profitability 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our reseller customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure which could harm our profitability and financial condition 
international net revenues revenues outside of north america accounted for  and of total net revenues for  and  respectively see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fiscal year ended  we continued to make investments in europe  asia and  to a lesser degree  in latin america 
this expansion of resources was the main reason for the increase in the international percentage of total net revenues despite the increase in net revenue from sales of our network access products which were sold primarily in north america 
an increase in our video communication products unit sales volume in europe  asia and latin america was the primary reason for the increase in the international percentage of total net revenues in over in  our increased investment in resources in europe over helped drive volumes and revenues up as a percentage of our revenue 
within europe  video revenues were the main driver of the increase in over in addition  net revenues derived from sales of our products in asia also increased as a percentage of our net revenue in over we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future  and we plan to continue our expansion in europe  asia and latin america in international sales  however  are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as we introduce new products  since we expect to initially introduce such products in north america and also because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  however  if international sales were denominated in local currencies in the future  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation risks 
further  to date  the establishment of the european currency unit the euro by the european union as the common legal currency in europe has not had any significant impact on us since a substantial majority of our international sales are denominated in us currency 
however  there may be an impact in the future due to the recent weakening of the euro against the dollar as this requires customers to convert a greater number euros into dollars to settle their outstanding debts to us 
cost of net revenues cost of net revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense and an allocation of overhead expenses 
the cost of net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues for the year ended december  was  a slight decrease from in the decrease was attributable to a more favorable product mix generated from increased shipments of higher margin video products  and favorable material price variances  offset by a write down of certain media server inventory  including the showstation ip  to net realizable value and higher shipment volumes of our lower margin network access products 
when comparing the cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues in to  the percentage decreased to from 
the improvement in cost in over was attributable to a more favorable product mix as more shipments of the higher margin video products occurred  and favorable material price improvements 
these decreases were offset by a write down of the showstation ip inventory and the soundpoint inventory to net realizable value and reduced revenue received under a joint development and marketing agreement with m concerning the viewstation which had very low associated costs 
we received million in revenue under this agreement in compared to million in forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult 
while we expect that our future overall cost of net revenues percentage will be within a few percentage points of the current level  there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
for example  uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of net revenues percentage to fluctuate significantly 
additionally  our iad and dsl equipment products  voip products and other desktop products have a significantly higher cost of net revenue percentage than our viewstation and soundstation products 
if the iad  dsl  voip and other desktop products grow to be become a significant portion of our revenue stream  this will have a negative effect on our future cost of net revenues percentages 
also  we may reduce prices on our products in the future for competitive reasons or to stimulate demand which could increase our cost of net revenues percentage 
however  we cannot assure you that any of these potential price reductions would offset competitive pressures or stimulate demand 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  such as the netengine or any other new product  could occur which would increase our cost of net revenues percentage 
further  gross margins associated with the viavideo  viewstation sp and the soundpoint pro are lower than the targeted gross margins of our product portfolio  yet the gross margins for the webstation are closer to our targeted gross margins 
the proportional contribution of these products to our product mix can have a significant impact on our overall gross margins 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues may increase due to a change in the mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
sales and marketing expenses year end december  increase decrease from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  an allocation of overhead expenses and customer service and support costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in over was primarily related to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for our video and network access products 
additionally  an increase in our investment in our worldwide sales effort also contributed to the increases over the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in over was primarily related to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for our video and voice products 
additionally  an increase in our investment in our worldwide sales efforts and the resulting staff increases also contributed to the increase over we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts in an effort to expand north american and international markets  market new products and establish and expand distribution channels 
in particular  our acquisition of atlas expanded our product portfolio into the dsl access market which will require significant additional marketing expenditures to communicate the value of our new product offerings as well as significant additional sales expenditures to develop a new sales organization for this market 
in addition  due to the innovative nature of our viewstation  viavideo and upcoming voip products  we believe we will incur additional expenses for sales and marketing  especially advertising  to educate potential customers as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
also  we will further invest in the international markets  increasing the absolute dollars spent in this area 
further  we are currently expanding our service organization to provide expanded and improved support for our products which will increase our sales and marketing expenses 
research and development expenses year end december  increase decrease from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  consulting fees  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses 
expense increases in video  voice and network access product development all contributed to the total increase in over individually  the increase in video communication product development expenditures accounted for of the total increase  network access development expenditures accounted for of the total increase and the increase in voice communications accounted for the remaining of the total increase 
the research and development expense increased in over due to increases in the network access  video and voice products 
in all years presented  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives such as dsl access  voip and desktop products will require significant research and development spending 
consequently  we intend to increase research and development expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in the future 
however  due to the extremely competitive hiring market in high technology industries  we may not be able to find or hire qualified personnel in a timely manner or at all 
general and administrative expenses year end december  increase decrease from prior year dollars in thousands expenses    of net revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  allocation of overhead expenses  bad debt write offs  legal expenses and accounting expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was due to increased staffing and infrastructure costs to support our growth  including the additional costs to upgrade our management information system  expansions in europe and asia  and higher bad debt expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was due to increased staffing and infrastructure costs to support our growth including the conversion of the management information system 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and costs related to supporting a larger company 
these additional charges include principally expenses related to expansions of our information system  increased tax planning efforts and infrastructure charges related to the significant investments being made in the international regions 
additionally  write offs associated with bad debt are difficult to predict and material write offs could negatively affect our profitability in the quarter they are made 
acquisition costs we incurred acquisition costs totaling million in  million in and million in in  these costs were related to the acquisition of accord networks ltd 
which was completed in february in  these costs were related to the acquisition of atlas completed in december in  the costs incurred were related to the acquisition of viavideo 
a significant portion of these charges for these acquisitions were for outside financial advisory  legal and accounting services 
we expect further material acquisition related expenses associated with the accord networks ltd 
acquisition in and there may be other acquisition expenses related to other such transactions in the future 
litigation reserve release on september   vtel corporation vtel filed a lawsuit in the state district court in travis county  texas against viavideo communications  inc  a subsidiary of polycom  and its founders who were formerly employed by vtel 
on may   vtel amended its suit to add polycom as a defendant 
in the lawsuit  vtel alleged breach of contract  breach of confidential relationship  disclosure of proprietary information and related allegations 
viavideo  its founders and polycom answered the suit  denying in their entirety vtel s allegations 
on march   vtel voluntarily dismissed the allegations against polycom and viavideo with prejudice for no consideration 
as a one time item in the first quarter of  the excess accrual associated with the expenses we estimated we would incur in connection with this lawsuit  totaling million  was released since no further material expenses will be incurred 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income  net interest income  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of polycom s bank accounts and interest expense from polycom s credit facilities 
interest income  net of interest expense was million in  million in and million in the fluctuations in interest income  net are due primarily to changes in average cash and investment balances throughout the year the most significant of which relates to our secondary stock offering which raised million in the third quarter of other investments adjustment throughout the year ended december   we made various investments in private companies that are included in other investments in our balance sheet 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we monitor the value of these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
during  we determined that the value of these investments became impaired and we reduced the carrying amount by million 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in  million in and million in the increase in income taxes in over was due to our increased profitability 
the increase in income taxes in over was also due to our increased profitability offset by the reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance in due to our belief that the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
additionally  we have a million line of credit with a bank and million in other investments related to non marketable equity securities 
the line of credit facility contains provisions that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and profitability requirements 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the improvement in cash from operating activities in over was due primarily to the improvements in net income before non cash items and an increase in the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
this improvement was offset somewhat by higher growth in inventories  deferred taxes  non trade receivables and a lower increase in current liabilities 
the improvement in cash from operating activities in over was due primarily to the improvement in net income before non cash items  an increase in accounts and taxes payable and a smaller increase in inventories  offset somewhat by the growth in receivables and deferred taxes 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from a follow on stock offering net of issuance costs  million from operating activities and million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
the primary uses of cash during this same period were million for net purchases of investments  million for purchases of property  plant and equipment and million for purchases of licenses 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income before considering non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  the investment loss adjustment  and higher total current liabilities including accounts payable and taxes payable  offset by an increase in inventories  trade and non trade receivables  deferred taxes and other assets 
our material commitments consist of obligations under our operating leases 
we also maintain  from time to time  commercial letters of credit as payments for the importation of certain products 
these amounts do not exceed  and are outstanding less than days 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total less than  and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in august  we completed the follow on offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
of the shares sold  approximately million shares were sold by us for net proceeds of approximately million  and the balance of shares were sold by a selling stockholder 
we are using the net proceeds from this sale primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
a portion of the proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
pending such uses  we are investing the net proceeds from this sale in short term and long term  interest bearing  investment grade obligations 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements through at least the next eighteen months 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technologies 
recent developments on february   we announced the completion of our acquisition of accord network  ltd  a leading provider of next generation  rich media network products that enable internet protocol ip and other network voice and video communications in both the customer premise and service provider markets 
under the terms of the merger  originally announced december   we exchanged approximately million shares of common stock for all outstanding accord shares and will assume accord options and warrants exercisable into approximately million shares of polycom common stock 
the exchange and assumption will occur at a rate of polycom shares for each accord share 
we will account for the merger as a pooling of interests 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas  as amended by sfas  established methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities  and is effective for the fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted this pronouncement on january  this adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the effective date of this pronouncement is the fourth quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  the adoption of sab has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
in addition  these rsks are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rates 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors 
these factors include changes in general economic conditions  as has been the case recently  and specific economic conditions in the technology industries  market acceptance of new product introductions and product enhancements by us or our competitors  our prices and those of our competitors products  the timing and size of the orders for our products  the mix of products sold  fluctuations in the level of international sales  the delay in the rollout of dsl technology  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  changes in our distribution network  fluctuations in demand for our products  the impact of seasonality  and the level of royalties to third parties 
although we have had significant revenue growth in recent quarters  fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to these or other factors could prevent us from sustaining these growth rates or meeting our expectations  and you should not use these past results to predict future operating margins and results 
in particular  our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of customer orders received during a given quarter  and the percentage of each order which we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter  each of which is difficult to forecast 
in addition  the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the third month of that quarter 
if this trend continues  any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter will seriously harm our business 
some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products 
for example  there appears to be a slow down in the summer quarter for our products in the european region 
in addition  sales of our video communications products appear to decline in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
these fluctuations negatively affect our business during those quarters which could cause operating results to fall short of anticipated results  which would have a negative impact on our stock price 
as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market analysts  our stock price will decline 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions  which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by our end user customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products  and increased price competition 
although these factors have not materially impacted us in recent years  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  these factors could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  we also face the risk that our resellers will build up inventories in anticipation of a growth in sales 
if such sales growth does not occur as anticipated by these resellers for any reason  including the slowdown in economic growth that began in the fourth quarter of and is continuing in  these resellers may substantially decrease the amount of product ordered in subsequent periods  which would harm our business 
difficulty in estimating customer orders could harm our operating results 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and historically have had no material backlog 
as a result  backlog  at any point in time  is not a good indicator of future net revenues  and net revenues for any particular quarter cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
additionally  orders from our reseller customers are based on the level of demand from end users 
the uncertainty of end user demand means that any quarter could be significantly negatively impacted by lower end user orders  which could in turn negatively affect orders we receive from our resellers 
accordingly  our expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm reseller orders 
expense levels are based  in part  on these estimates 
since a majority of our customer orders are received in the last month of a quarter  we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly if for any reason orders and net revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period 
in addition  we have historically experienced a lag in demand during the summer months  which adds to the level of difficulty in predicting revenue levels 
we depend on distributors and resellers to sell our products  and we are subject to risks associated with their inventories of our products  their product sell through and the success of their businesses 
we sell a significant amount of our products to distributors and resellers who maintain their own inventory of products for sale to dealers and end users 
a substantial percentage of the total products sold during a particular quarter consists of distributor and reseller stocking orders 
we typically provide special cost or early payment incentives for distributors and resellers to purchase the minimum or more than the minimum quantities required under their agreements with us 
if these distributors and resellers are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if distributors and resellers decide to decrease their inventories for numerous reasons including the reduction in economic growth realized in the fourth quarter of and further anticipated in  it would negatively affect the volume of our sales to these distributors and resellers and also negatively affect our net revenues which could harm our business 
also  if we choose to eliminate or reduce stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenues may fail to meet our expectations or be lower than historical levels 
our revenue estimates are based largely on end user sales reports that our distributors and resellers provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate in north america but less reliable outside of this region 
to the extent that this sales and channel inventory data is inaccurate in either north america or outside of north america  we may not be able to make revenue estimates or may find that our previous estimates were inaccurate 
many of our distributors and resellers that carry multiple polycom products  and from whom we derive significant revenues  are undercapitalized 
the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability or obtain financing could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability 
for example  in the fiscal year  we increased our allowance for bad debt by million for specific reseller default situations for which collection is doubtful 
the loss of distributors or resellers could harm our business 
lucent technologies  one of our larger resellers  accounted for of our net revenues in the three months ended december   primarily related to lucent s purchases of our network access products during that period 
in addition  lucent accounted for of net revenues in both and if lucent technologies reduces its purchases of our products due to the current economic slowdown or any other factor  it will harm our business 
in addition  lucent technologies has spun off its business equipment division  now known as avaya inc we do not yet know how this spin off will affect us 
in connection with this restructuring  if the combined business from lucent and avaya yields a significant reduction in the amount of orders to us  it could harm our business 
late in the first quarter of  we began shipping the viewstation fx product 
the timing of this delivery date likely created confusion in our reseller customer base and end user customer market as these groups waited to see if this new viewstation product was more desirable than the existing products 
therefore  the timing of this new product release likely had a negative effect on our first quarter sales in to resellers and sales out to end users 
we cannot assure you that a similar situation will not happen again 
a major contributor to the expected growth of the broadband distribution market has been the deployment of digital subscriber lines  or dsl 
beginning in the second half of  some dsl providers experienced delays in delivering their service which caused financial troubles for these companies 
these dsl providers are customers of our network access products through oem providers we use as resellers 
these service delays slowed the expected growth in this market which in turn slowed sales of our network access products 
if these conditions persist  they will negatively impact revenues from our network access products 
we may experience delays in product introductions and our products may contain defects which could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation and seriously harm our results of operations 
since the beginning of  our revenue growth has been due in large part to new video communications product introductions 
although we are continuing to introduce new products  such as the viavideo  viewstation  viewstation fx and soundpoint pro products  we cannot assure you that new product releases will be timely or that they will be made at all 
in fact  the viewstation fx and viavideo were delayed from their original release dates  which we believe negatively affected our net revenues in additionally  we cannot assure you that any new or existing product introductions will be free from defects or produce the revenue growth experienced in and in the past we have experienced other delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements and believe that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  we experienced delays in introducing the viewstation fx in and the viewstation mp and webstation in from their original expected release dates due to unforeseen technology and manufacturing ramping issues 
similar delays occurred during the introduction of the showstation ip  soundstation premier and showstation  affecting the first customer ship dates of these products 
any similar delays in the future for other new product offerings such as voip  desktop or other product line extensions could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation and seriously harm our results of operations 
further  due to the dynamic nature of the network access market sector  any delays in netengine product line extensions would seriously harm our business 
we have limited supply sources for some key components of our products  and our operations could be harmed by supply interruptions  component defects or unavailability of these components 
some key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources  including some key integrated circuits and optical elements 
we also obtain certain plastic housings  metal castings and other components from suppliers located in singapore and china  and any political or economic instability in that region in the future  or future import restrictions  may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies 
we have no supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers 
we and our contract manufacturers have had limited experience purchasing volume supplies of various components for our products and some of the components included in our products  such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits  have from time to time been subject to limited allocations by suppliers 
in the event that we or our contract manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components or develop alternative sources as needed  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
in particular we have recently encountered some development delays and component shortages relating to our network access products  and if such conditions continue  our business will suffer 
moreover  our operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions 
additionally  our video communications products are designed based on integrated circuits produced by philips and video equipment produced by sony 
if we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or video equipment from these suppliers  we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers  and we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost effective manner 
additionally  both sony and philips are our competitors in the video communications market  which may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary components 
the failure to obtain adequate supplies could prevent or delay product shipments  which could harm our business 
we also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products  in particular  our network access products 
any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business 
we rely on third party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which would harm our business 
we have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products 
for example  we license video communications source code from radvision  telesoft  omnitel  adtran and ebsnet  video algorithm protocols from real networks and ezenia  development source code from digital equipment and philips semiconductor  audio algorithms from lucent technologies  communication software from databeam and windows software from microsoft 
in addition  for our new network access products  we have interoperability agreements with jetstream communications and tollbridge technologies  and we depend significantly on these agreements and our ability to secure similar licenses from other gateway providers 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  licensed and integrated  if at all possible  which would harm our business 
lower than expected market acceptance of our products and price competition would negatively impact our business 
if our products are not accepted by the market  our profitability could be harmed 
for example  we lowered the price of the showstation ip by effective march due to market acceptance issues for this product 
similar price reductions and demand issues could occur for any of our products which could negatively impact our net revenues and profitability 
further  through the end of  growth rates of voice and video product sales from our sales channels to end users have been significant 
future growth rates for these and our other products may not achieve these levels of growth 
our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressure in the conferencing equipment and network access device markets 
although past price reductions have been driven by our desire to expand the market for our products  and we expect that in the future we may further reduce prices or introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to further expand the market or to respond to competitive pricing pressures  such actions may not have the desired impact 
international sales are accounting for an increasing portion of our net revenues  and risks inherent in international sales could harm our business 
international sales are accounting for an increasing portion of our net revenues  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable and potentially adverse tax consequences 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as we introduce new products  since we expect to initially introduce any new products in north america and also because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  however  if international sales were denominated in local currencies in the future  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation risks 
the completion of our acquisition of circa communications ltd 
is contingent upon certain conditions 
in september  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire circa communications ltd  or circa  a canadian corporation which develops voice over internet protocol  or voip  telephony products 
we believe that the acquisition of circa will augment our voip technology  product development and product offerings 
we currently anticipate that this acquisition will be completed by the end of the first quarter of  however the acquisition is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions by circa  including the general availability of certain of circa s voip products and proper legal filing with the canadian government 
in the event that circa does not satisfy the conditions required for us to complete the acquisition  it is probable we will not consummate the acquisition 
if we do not consummate the circa acquisition  our plans to augment our voip technology  product development and product offerings would be delayed  and this delay would harm our business 
our recent acquisition of accord networks could adversely impact our business 
we completed the acquisition of accord networks  or accord  on february  as a result of the completion of the acquisition  we face additional risks that are set forth in the section entitled risk factors  on pages of the proxy statement prospectus dated january   and filed with the securities and exchange commission on january   which are incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
these risks relate to the impact of the merger on our business  risks related to the operation of the combined company  and risks related to the business of accord  including its operations in israel 
our business could suffer as a result of future acquisitions  such as circa communications 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
for example  as described above  we are currently scheduled to complete the acquisition of circa communications by the end of the first quarter of failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of this or any future acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of circa could also harm our business and results of operations 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will not incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with any future acquisitions we may make 
conflicts with our channel partners could hurt sales of our products 
we have various oem agreements with some major telecommunications equipment manufacturers  such as lucent technologies  whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the oem 
these relationships can create channel conflicts with our other distributors who directly compete with the oem partner  which could adversely affect revenue from non oem channels 
because many of our distributors also sell equipment that competes with our products  the distributors could devote more attention to the other products  which could harm our business 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause distributors to devote resources to other non polycom communications equipment  which would negatively affect our business or results of operations 
we currently have agreements with video communications equipment suppliers under which these equipment suppliers resell our soundpoint pc voice products along with their video communications products 
we compete with these equipment suppliers in the voice conferencing market and  as such  we cannot assure you that they will enter into future agreements to resell or supply any of our new or enhanced communication products 
further  some of our current video products and video products under development are directly competitive with the products of these suppliers 
as a consequence  competition between us and these suppliers is likely to increase  resulting in a strain on the existing relationship between the companies 
any such strain could limit the potential contribution of these relationships to our business 
in addition  we depend on several key agreements  including our agreement with jetstream communications in the network access products market 
conflicts may occur in this evolving market as we seek other relationships 
these conflicts could harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our resellers in the use of those products 
the markets for voice and video communications products and network access products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of our new products depends on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with dsl and isdn compatibility  reseller training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect our success in this market 
further  the shift of communications from circuit switched to ip based technologies over time may require us to add new resellers and gain new core technological competencies 
we are attempting to address these needs and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts and joint developments with other companies 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new voice  video and network access product opportunities and develop and bring new voice  video and network access products to market in a timely manner 
further  we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
the failure of our new voice  video and network access product development efforts and any inability to service or maintain the necessary third party interoperability licenses would harm our business and results of operations 
manufacturing disruptions or capacity constraints would harm our business 
we subcontract the manufacture of our soundstation  soundstation premier  soundpoint pro  viewstation and our new network access products to celestica  a third party contract manufacturer 
we use celestica s thailand facilities  and should there be any disruption in services due to natural disaster or economic or political difficulties in thailand and asia  or for any other reason  such disruption would harm our business and results of operations 
also  celestica is currently the sole source manufacturer of these products  and if this subcontractor experiences an interruption in operations or otherwise suffers from capacity constraints  we would experience a delay in shipping these products and we may not be able to meet any demand for our products  either of which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption and harm our reputation 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
product obsolescence and other asset impairment can negatively affect our results of operations 
we operate in a high technology market which is subject to rapid and frequent technology changes 
these technology changes can and do often render existing technologies obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the existing inventory cannot be sold at or above net realizable value 
this situation occurred during the first quarter of for the showstation ip when we recorded additional excess and obsolescence charges 
in addition  if the introduction of our soundpoint pro product has a materially negative effect on the future sales of our soundpoint product  our net revenues could be reduced and an excess and obsolescence issue concerning our soundpoint inventory could result  which could lower our profitability 
the potential for new products to render existing products obsolete or reduce the demand for existing products exists for every one of our products 
we cannot assure you that future inventory  investment  license  fixed asset or other asset writedowns will not happen 
if future writedowns do occur  they could harm our business 
our recent transition to a new enterprise resource planning system could adversely affect our operations 
during the last quarter of and throughout the fiscal year  we migrated our operations to a new enterprise resource planning system which affects almost every facet of our business operations 
typically  these conversions negatively affect a company s ability to conduct business due to problems such as historical data conversion errors  the required personnel training time associated with the new system  delays in implementation or unforeseen technical problems during conversion 
if any problems arise during this transitional phase  we could experience delays in or lack of shipping  an inability to support our existing customer base  delays in paying vendors  delays in collecting from customers  an inability to place or receive product orders or other operational problems 
if this were to occur  our profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted 
failure to adequately service and support our products could harm our results of operations 
our recent growth has been due in large part to an expansion into products with more complex technologies and protocols  including our recently introduced network access products 
this has increased the need for increased product warranty and service capabilities 
if we cannot develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationship with our outside technical support  it could harm our business 
our cash flow could fluctuate due to our ability to collect receivables 
in and  we initiated significant investments in europe and asia to expand our business in these regions 
in europe and asia  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe  asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our net revenues  as happened in and  accounts receivable balances will likely increase over previous years 
additionally  sales in the network access and video communications markets typically have longer payment periods over our traditional experience in the voice communications market 
therefore  if network access and video products constitute a greater percentage of net revenues  accounts receivable balances will likely increase 
these increases would cause our days sales outstanding to increase over prior years and will negatively affect future cash flows 
although we have been able to offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to resellers at the end of the quarter in the form of prepaid discounts  these additional incentives have lowered our profitability 
our stock price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and international macroeconomic factors 
in addition  recently the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies  such as polycom 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power 
in the event these blackouts continue or increase in severity  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reseller customer contracts are typically short term and early terminations of our contracts may harm our results of operations 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our reseller customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our reseller customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our results of operations 
failure to manage our growth may harm our business 
our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion and acquisitions  and continued growth may cause a significant strain on our infrastructure and internal systems 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our management information systems and continue resource additions such as headcount  capital and processes in a timely and efficient manner 
we cannot assure you that resources will be available when we need them or that we will have sufficient capital to fund these resource needs 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of our executive officers 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively  or we experience a shortfall in resources  our results of operations will be harmed 
if we fail to successfully compete in our markets  our business and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
in the video communications market  our major competitors include picturetel  tandberg  sony  vcon and vtel 
many of these companies have substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
in addition  with advances in telecommunications standards  connectivity and video processing technology and the increasing market acceptance of video communications  other established or new companies may develop or market products competitive with our video communications products 
in addition  our video streaming products employ technology from microsoft and real networks who both have solutions competitive with our products 
the market for voice communications equipment  particularly voiceconferencing  is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and emerging industry standards 
we expect competition to persist and increase in the future 
in the voice communications equipment market segment  our major competitors include clearone  soundgear  nec  gentner and other companies that offer lower cost  full duplex speakerphones such as lucent technologies and hello direct 
hello direct  one of our resellers  offers a competitive product under the hello direct name through an oem relationship with gentner 
most of these companies have substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
in addition  all major telephony manufacturers produce hands free speakerphone units that are a lower cost than our voice communications products 
our network access products have significant competition from efficient networks  netopia  com and cisco systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance characteristics 
new product introductions by our competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and future products 
we believe that the possible effects from ongoing competition may be the reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors products or the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products 
we expect this increased competitive pressure may lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices and gross margins which would significantly harm our results of operations 
we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights  which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the us or foreign countries  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
in addition  foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
we face and might in the future face intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products 
for example  we have been named in along with approximately manufacturers or distributors of electronic or semiconductor products and served with a complaint filed by the lemelson medical  education and research foundation alleging patent infringement by us 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have on occasion resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in the past  we have been involved in such litigation  which adversely affected our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such litigation  that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using the technologies subject to any such claims or be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to and legal costs associated with litigation can have a significant adverse effect on operating results 
if we fail to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will be harmed 
our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees  particularly technical and management  as needed  could harm our business 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel could harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments and our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
we are subject to fluctuating interest rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our results of operations or cash flows for our variable rate bank borrowings  available for sale securities and cash and cash equivalents 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of december  expected maturity total in thousands  except interest rates assets cash and cash equivalents   average interest rates short term and long term investments    average interest rates liabilities bank line of credit average interest rates the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
we also hold a million investment in publicly traded equity securities which was marked to market from our original million investment value 
the market risk for this investment is driven by movements in the market price of this investment 
we have made investments in private companies 
these investments are included in other investments in our balance sheet and are carried at cost less any impairment loss 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when necessary 
impairment losses are evaluated regularly and are driven by movements in the current valuations of these companies  which are influenced by general securities market conditions 
for all of these investment  our ownership is less than of the company and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operations 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
as only a small amount of foreign bills are paid in currencies other than the us dollar  our foreign exchange risk is considered immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
