item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements that are included in part ii  item of this form k  beginning on page f of this report 
as a result of bridge filing for bankruptcy on february  and our inability to raise capital  as further explained in part i  item risks related to our business on page  in liquidity and capital resources later in this section  and in note to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item on page f  our ability to continue as a going concern in the normal course of business is uncertain 
overview we are a growing provider of high quality  high performance global data networking and internet related services to medium and large businesses  multinational corporations and internet service providers 
to provide our internet access services  we use the savvis intelligent ip network sm  a data communications network that uses our twelve privatenaps sm and our proprietary routing policies to reduce data loss and enhance performance by avoiding the congested public access points on the internet 
we began commercial operations in  offering internet access services to local and regional internet service providers 
our customer base has grown from customers at the end of to  at december  on april   we were acquired by bridge in a stock for stock transaction that was accounted for as a purchase transaction under accounting principles board opinion no 
since the purchase transaction resulted in our company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of bridge  sec rules required us to establish a new basis of accounting for the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
as a result  the purchase price has been allocated to the underlying assets purchased and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair market value of these assets and liabilities on the acquisition date  and the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value was recorded as goodwill 
the accounting for the purchase transaction has been pushed down to our financial statements 
the impact of the acquisition on our balance sheet  as a result of the application of fair value accounting  was to increase intangibles  goodwill  other liabilities and stockholders equity 
as a result of the acquisition and the push down accounting  our results of operations following the acquisition  particularly our depreciation and amortization  are not comparable to our results of operations prior to the acquisition 
on september   bridge sold in a private placement approximately of its equity ownership in savvis to the existing stockholders of bridge  at which time welsh carson purchased from bridge a interest in savvis 
on february   bridge completed the sale of an additional  shares of savvis common stock to welsh carson anderson stowe welsh carson 
as of march   bridge and welsh carson owned approximately and of our outstanding common stock  respectively 
the initial public offering of our common stock was completed in february a total of million shares were sold in the offering   shares sold by us and  shares sold by bridge  all at per share 
we received net proceeds from this offering of approximately million 
simultaneously with the completion of the initial public offering  we acquired bridge s global internet protocol network for total consideration of approximately million plus a payment representing a preferential distribution to bridge of approximately million 
the purchase has substantially increased our depreciation and amortization 
at that time  we entered into a year network services agreement with bridge under which we provide managed data networking services to bridge 
our initial network service fees are based upon the cash cost to bridge of operating the network as configured on october   as adjusted for changes to the network and associated personnel related to bridge s network requirements through february  our fees for additional services provided following february  were set for a three year term based on an agreed price schedule 
our revenues from bridge exceeded this minimum price guarantee for the year ended december  the minimum cost to bridge per the network services agreement is million and million for savvis to provide the network services in and  respectively 
in addition  bridge has agreed that the amount paid to us under the agreement for the fourth  fifth and sixth years will not be less than of the total amount paid by bridge and its subsidiaries for internet protocol data transport services in each of those years  and the amount paid to us under the agreement for the seventh through tenth years will not be less than of the total amount paid by bridge and its subsidiaries for internet protocol data transport services in each of those years 
because the amounts paid to us under the network services agreement for the services provided over the original network acquired from bridge are based upon the cash cost to operate the original network  the provision of such services did not have an impact on our cash flows from operations 
however  due to amortization and depreciation relating to the network  the provision of services under the network services agreement resulted in our incurring losses from operations  and these losses will continue unless we can sell additional services over the network to bridge or to other customers 
the effects of such operating losses will include continued increases in our accumulated deficit and reductions in stockholders equity 
bridge has agreed to provide to us various services  including technical support  customer support and project management in the areas of installation  provisioning  help desk  and repair and maintenance 
in addition  bridge has agreed to provide to us additional administrative and operational support services until we develop the capabilities to perform these services ourselves 
due to the potential sale of bridge or its assets and the possibility of the rejection of these agreements  we may be forced to perform these services ourselves in the near future 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of data networking principally to bridge  and internet access services 
for the year  bridge represented of our total revenue 
through december   our revenue was primarily derived from the sale of internet access services to local and regional internet service providers in the united states 
beginning in late  we also began to offer internet security and hosting services to corporate customers 
beginning in september  we began to offer managed data networking services 
we expect our revenues from bridge to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues as we expand our data networking  internet access and hosting customer base 
we charge each customer an initial installation fee that typically ranges from to  and a fixed monthly fee that varies depending on the services provided  the bandwidth used and the quality of service level chosen 
our customer agreements are typically for to months in length 
these fees are recognized in income over the average life of the customer contracts 
prices for telecommunication services  including the services we offer  have decreased significantly over the past several years and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
direct costs and expenses data communications and operations 
data communications and operations expenses include the cost of o connections to other internet service providers  o leasing local access lines  o transmission connections  o salaries and related benefits for engineering and operations personnel  o other related repairs and maintenance items  o leasing routers and switches  o leasing hosting space  and o installing local access lines at customer sites 
these costs also include the cost of the network operations center  as well as the customer help desk and other services that are provided by bridge under the technical services agreement 
data communications and operations expense has increased significantly with the inclusion of the bridge network 
in addition  we expect that these costs will continue to increase in total dollars as we expand our network and increase our customer base  but we expect an eventual decrease as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
these expenses include the cost of o sales and marketing salaries and related benefits  o sales commissions and referral payments  o advertising and direct marketing  and o travel 
we anticipate that these expenses will continue to increase in total dollars as we add more sales personnel and increase our marketing initiatives to support the expansion of our customer base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of o occupancy costs  o executive  financial  legal  tax and administrative support personnel  o professional services  including legal  accounting  tax and consulting o bad debt expense  and o travel 
these expenses are expected to continue to increase as we continue to add to our support personnel  infrastructure and back office systems as the business continues to ramp up and the network is expanded 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of the depreciation and amortization of communications equipment  capital leases  goodwill and intangibles 
we expect these expenses to continue to increase as we make significant investments in the network as we expand our business 
generally  depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the useful life of the associated asset  which ranges from three to five years 
goodwill resulting from our acquisition by bridge is being amortized over three years and other intangibles are amortized over one to three years 
interest expense 
historical interest expense is related to indebtedness to banks  convertible notes  loans from bridge and capitalized leases 
in connection with our purchase of bridge s internet protocol network assets  we entered into capitalized sub leases with bridge relating to their capitalized leases for network equipment that bridge could not directly assign to us 
additional capitalized leases were entered into in relating to the network expansion 
also  during the company executed credit agreements with vendors to acquire network equipment and related services 
accordingly  we expect our interest expense to continue to increase as further expansion to the network occurs 
income tax expense 
we incurred operating losses from inception through december  and  therefore  have not recorded a provision for income taxes in our historical financial statements 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets because the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and foreign net operating losses of approximately million 
section of the internal revenue code restricts the utilization of us net operating losses and other us carryover tax attributes upon the occurrence of an ownership change  as defined 
such an ownership change occurred during as a result of the acquisition of our company by bridge 
management believes that this limitation may restrict our ability to utilize the net operating losses over the us statutory carry forward periods ranging from to years 
as we continue to expand our network  increase our employee base to support our expanded operations and invest in our marketing and sales operations  we expect our losses  net cash used in operating activities and negative adjusted ebitda to continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
results of operations the historical financial information included in this form k will not reflect our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows subsequent to the purchase of bridge s network and the commencement of the related agreements is not comparable to prior periods 
the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  amounts represents combined predecessor and successor information revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  from million for the year ended december  the revenue growth resulting from the initiation of managed data network services  including services provided under the bridge network services agreement entered into on february   accounted for million of the increase 
internet access revenues increased to million in the twelve months of  compared to million for these increases were driven by an increase in active customer circuits of to approximately  as of december  from  as of december  other revenues  consisting of installation and equipment sales  increased from million in to million in data communications and operations 
exclusive of non cash compensation data communications and operations expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses related principally to the costs incurred by savvis to operate the internet protocol network acquired from bridge since february  and other increases in the number of leased long distance  dedicated customer and dial up circuits to support the increased customer circuits in operation 
sales and marketing 
exclusive of non cash compensation sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   up or million as compared to this increase is principally attributed to personnel related costs and sales commissions of million associated with the growth in sales and marketing staff  a million increase in expenditures on advertising and marketing initiatives  and a million increase in travel and training related items 
general and administrative 
exclusive of non cash compensation general and administrative expenses amounted to million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
this increase resulted from increased personnel costs of million to support the expansion of the customer base and the overall growth of the business  increased occupancy costs of million related to the move to the company s new headquarters during the second quarter and increased costs for the growing employee base  an increase of million for professional audit  tax  legal and consulting services  an increase of million in services provided by bridge under the administrative services agreement  and an increase of million in travel expense associated with the overall growth of the business 
bad debt expense amounted to million in versus 
million for the year ended december  non cash equity based compensation 
non cash equity based compensation amounted to million for the year ended december  versus a million expense in these expenses represent amortization charges to earnings for the years ended december  and  respectively  for the difference between the estimated fair market value of our common stock and the exercise price for options granted to employees and non employee members of our board of directors on various dates in early and late  as well as options granted to employees of bridge in and early because the predecessor statement of operations in is presented on a different basis of accounting  the following areas in the statement of operations for the year ended december  are not compared depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  of this total  million is attributed to depreciation on the network acquired on february  and subsequent network equipment acquisitions  and million relates to the amortization of goodwill and intangibles associated with the mandated push down accounting ascribed to the bridge acquisition of savvis in april asset impairment other write downs of assets 
during  an asset write down in the amount of million was required to adjust our investment in specialized customer application software to its estimated net realizable value 
interest 
interest income from the investment of the initial public offering proceeds amounted to million for the year ended december  interest expense during the same period  primarily attributable to interest expense on capital equipment financing incurred since the acquisition of the internet protocol network in february and amounts payable to bridge  amounted to million 
net loss 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or basic and diluted loss per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following discussion compares combined information of savvis and our predecessor for the year ended december   with those of our predecessor for the year ended december  the combined information consists of the sum of the financial data from january  through april  for the predecessor and from april  through december  for savvis 
the acquisition by bridge resulted in a new basis of accounting  which impacted depreciation and amortization  impairment of assets and interest expense in the period subsequent to april  revenue 
revenue was million in compared to million in  an increase of 
this million increase was primarily due to increased marketing and sales efforts and the resulting increase in the number of customers from to data communications and operations 
data communications and operations expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of 
this million increase was due to costs associated with the expansion of our network and the increase in the customer base 
sales and marketing and general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of 
the principal increase in these expenses resulted from the increased size of our sales force in marketing and administrative costs also increased in to support the increased number of customers 
liquidity and capital resources negative cash flow from operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million in due to our business growth and the expansion of the ip network 
this increase in negative cash flow primarily resulted from our costs for sales and marketing efforts  general and administrative enhancements  and interest costs necessary to support the increase in our customer base  internal infrastructure support and growth  and financing costs for network equipment purchases 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  which primarily reflects the purchase of the bridge internet protocol network and other property and equipment not financed 
we obtained funds for the year through issuances of equity securities and customer receipts  including receipts from bridge 
during the year  we increased our outstanding advances from bridge by million 
additionally  for the period february  to december   we also incurred obligations to bridge amounting to approximately million  for services provided by bridge under the technical services and administrative services agreements  for certain employee related expenses paid directly by bridge  and for telecommunication charges relating to our network that were paid by bridge 
these amounts owed to bridge have been applied  pursuant to existing rights of offset  against the outstanding receivable from bridge as of december  our capital expenditures  including the purchase of the bridge internet protocol network on february  for total consideration of approximately million  totaled approximately million in the year  including million that has been financed under existing or pending financing arrangements 
in addition to acquiring the bridge internet protocol network  we have acquired approximately million in network equipment through a combination of financing and cash purchases during in addition  we incurred approximately million in costs related to the construction of data centers in st 
louis and san francisco 
in connection with our purchase of the global internet protocol network assets from bridge  we also entered into a network services agreement under which we provide bridge with managed data networking services 
because the amounts paid to us under the network services agreement for the services provided over the original network acquired from bridge are based upon the cash cost to operate the original network  the provision of such services did not have an impact on our cash flows from operations 
however  due to amortization and depreciation relating to the network  the provision of services under the network services agreement resulted in our incurring losses from operations  and these losses will continue unless we can sell additional services over the network to bridge or to other customers 
the effects of such operating losses will continue to increase our accumulated deficit and reduce our stockholders equity 
on march   the company entered into a three year software licensing agreement with a vendor for the acquisition of unlimited software licenses in the amount of million for customer applications over our global network 
the agreement called for the total balance to be paid via installment payments through out the year 
as of december   an asset write down in the amount of million was required to adjust our investment in this specialized customer application software to its estimated net realizable value 
the following financing transactions occurred during the year see notes and to the consolidated financial statements o as part of the acquisition of the internet protocol network from bridge  we entered into a capital lease obligation with bridge for million 
as of march   the amount of our obligation under this lease was approximately million 
o on march   we entered into a million  thirty nine month capital lease facility relating to equipment necessary for the network expansion 
o on june   we entered into a global purchase agreement the global purchase agreement with nortel networks  inc nortel 
this agreement calls for us to purchase and take delivery of products and services from nortel in the amount of million from the date of the agreement through december  these products and services are to be financed by nortel pursuant to a credit agreement 
o on august   the company entered into two agreements with level communications  llc level 
these agreements grant to savvis exclusive indefeasible rights of use iru in certain segments of a multi conduit fiber optic communications system being constructed by level the term of each agreement is for a year period beginning with the acceptance of a segment and payment by savvis of the segment iru fee 
the agreements stipulate payments to level totaling approximately million 
as of december  we have paid to level approximately million pursuant to these agreements  which amounts were funded by drawings under the nortel term loan facility 
o on june   savvis executed an agreement to acquire approximately million of telecommunications equipment and related services with winstar wireless  inc winstar 
upon execution  we took delivery of certain equipment and paid approximately million to winstar 
of the remaining million  approximately million has been financed by winstar over six years at interest 
the unpaid balance of million has been recorded in other accrued liabilities 
on september   we executed an additional agreement with winstar to acquire approximately million in telecommunications equipment 
winstar has financed the unpaid balance of million over six years at interest 
o on september   we entered into a term loan facility agreement with nortel for the financing of approximately million of network equipment  installation services and third party expenses 
as of december  we have drawn approximately million under this financing arrangement for the purchase of equipment and services and other third party costs amounts drawn have been recorded in notes payable current portion 
o on september  and november   respectively  savvis entered into four  thirty nine month capital lease agreements to finance a total of approximately million in equipment necessary for the network expansion 
as a result of the bridge bankruptcy nortel s lending commitments under the nortel term loan facility have terminated 
we are currently discussing with nortel the reinstatement of those commitments 
if the commitments are not reinstated  we will be unable to fund approximately million of our cash requirements 
as a result we would be unable to proceed with the us fiber deployment and would be unable to meet our purchase commitments with nortel and level on march   we did not pay approximately million of interest and commitment fees due to nortel under the term loan facility and in april  we did not pay approximately million  due to gecc under capital lease obligations 
we are currently discussing waivers of these defaults with both nortel and gecc 
furthermore  savvis deposited the march and april payments  amounting to million  into a separate bank account instead of making the payments to bridge  thus causing a default with bridge under this lease 
other financing type transactions during include o on january   we entered into a year lease for our new   square foot  headquarters office building located in herndon  va 
monthly lease payments began at 
million per month and escalate to 
million per month by year ten 
o in august  we entered into a year agreement with kiel center partners  lp kcp pursuant to which we acquired the naming rights to an arena in st 
louis  missouri 
total consideration for these rights was measured as million and included  shares of our common stock issued to kcp which provides for all payments under this agreement for the first six years 
the related expense will be recognized over the term of the agreement 
we have arrangements with various suppliers of communications services that require us to maintain minimum spending levels some of which increase over time 
our aggregate minimum spending level is approximately million  million  million  million and million in years to  respectively 
savvis current spending levels under these agreements are substantially in excess of the spending commitments 
the majority of these minimum spending commitments have already been exceeded for the year should savvis not meet the minimum spending level in any given year  decreasing termination liabilities representing a percentage of the remaining contracted amount may immediately become due and payable 
furthermore  certain of these termination liabilities are subject to reduction should savvis experience the loss of a major customer or suffer a loss of revenues from a downturn in general economic activity 
before considering the effects of any reductions for the business downturn provisions  if savvis were to terminate all of these agreements as of april   the maximum termination liability would amount to approximately million 
as of december   savvis accounts receivable from bridge approximated million under the network services agreement 
this amount is net of approximately million in amounts due to bridge through december  under the technical services and administrative services agreements  for certain employee related expenses paid directly by bridge  and for telecommunication charges relating to the global internet protocol network that were paid by bridge 
these amounts due from savvis to bridge were all subject to contractual rights of offset against amounts due to bridge from savvis 
savvis currently bills bridge approximately million per month under the network services agreement 
in addition  savvis owes bridge approximately million  in the form of a note payable and accrued interest  relating to advances from bridge necessary to fund savvis operations from the date of the acquisition of savvis by bridge through february   the effective date of savvis initial public offering 
this note matured on february  on february   we advised bridge that  if permitted by applicable law  we intend to set off the note to bridge against bridge s indebtedness to us as of february   the date of bridge s bankruptcy filing 
accordingly  as of march   we have not remitted the total balance due of approximately million of principal and interest to bridge 
based upon our current plans for expansion  we will require approximately million to fund our operating losses  working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for we expect to fund these requirements through cash on hand and vendor financings aggregating million and approximately million of additional financings  including the million senior secured convertible notes recently raised from welsh carson 
however  bridge s bankruptcy filing negatively influences our cash position through delayed or omitted payments by bridge to us  demands by suppliers for advance or accelerated payments for continuing services  and restrictions by current or prospective providers of capital 
we may meet our remaining funding needs through a combination of equity investments  debt financings  renegotiation of repayment terms on existing debt and sales of assets and services 
we have retained merrill lynch co 
to advise us in our discussions with potential strategic partners 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any of these financings or that if we are the terms of such financings will be favorable to us 
if bridge were to cease operations  we believe we would require at least an additional million to fund our operations in if we are successful in raising funding  savvis will continue to explore ways to optimize the management of its working capital 
these efforts could involve renegotiation of existing contractual obligations  workforce reductions and elimination of nonessential expenditures 
as of march   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash on hand 
assuming bridge continues to make payments to us under the network services agreement  we currently have enough cash to run our business into may  should we be unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional capital by then  we may be required to cease operations or declare bankruptcy 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended by sfas no 
in june  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
fasb statement no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities  and measured by fair value 
additionally  it requires that changes in the derivative instrument s fair value be recognized in the statement of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the adoption of fasb statement no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we adopted sab effective january  the effect of implementation of sab was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures relate to changes in interest rates 
following the purchase of bridge s global internet protocol network assets in february  we have begun to expand our business internationally  and as a result  we are also exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our note payable to bridge and a number of network equipment financing arrangements 
these instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes  are denominated in us dollars  and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the term loan facility with nortel  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the nortel term loan facility bear interest at a market based variable rate 
the basis for the variable rate is selected by the company  along with the interest rate period  which may range from overnight to six months 
at the end of the interest rate period  the rate is reset in accordance with the company s selection and changes in market rates 
due to the relatively short nature of the interest rate periods  we do not expect our operating results or cash flow to be materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of our borrowings approximated their carrying value 
prior to our purchase of the network assets from bridge  changes in foreign exchange rates did not impact our results of operations 
for the year ended december   of our service revenue from bridge was derived from operations outside the united states and approximately of our total data communications and operations costs were incurred outside the united states 
we expect these percentages to remain relatively constant in the periods ahead 
because our foreign revenue closely matched our foreign costs  changes in foreign exchange rates did not have a material impact on our results of operations in this quarter 
in the future  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk
