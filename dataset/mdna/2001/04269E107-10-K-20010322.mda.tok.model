item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the production and development of novel chemical compounds with commercial potential in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
we primarily manufacture arrays of synthesized compounds for delivery to our customers for use in lead compound generation and lead compound optimization activities 
we also offer other research and development services to meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  we have established a number of joint drug discovery programs with biotechnology companies and academic institutions  and are pursuing a limited number of our own internal drug discovery programs 
we primarily generate revenue through our collaborative agreements for production and delivery of compound arrays and other research and development services 
under most of these collaborative agreements  we are also entitled to receive milestone and royalty payments if the customer develops products resulting from the collaboration 
to date  we have received two milestone payments and no royalty payments 
in addition  we have not yet realized any significant revenue from our joint discovery programs with biotechnology companies and academic institutions  or from our internal drug discovery programs 
while we expect our revenue to increase in  our financial performance may vary from expectations  including quarterly variations in performance  because levels of revenue are dependent on expanding or continuing existing collaborations  entering into additional corporate collaborations  receiving future milestones and royalty payments  and realizing value from ongoing drug discovery programs  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
we will continue to invest in technologies that enhance and expand our capabilities in drug discovery 
these continued investments in technology are intended to enhance the novelty  diversity  and medical relevance of our compound arrays and to augment the power and scope of our chemistry capabilities 
in addition to investments in technology  we may invest in internal lead optimization programs with the goal of delivering clinical candidates 
in november  we moved our main operations to a new facility in woburn  massachusetts  which includes  square feet of laboratory and office space 
investments of this nature may result in near term earnings fluctuations or impact the magnitude of profitability or loss 
in november we sold  shares of common stock at per share in a follow on public offering 
this included the exercise of the overallotment option of  shares 
the offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately  we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million through december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities related to our efforts to develop our technologies and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
while we were profitable in fiscal year  we will not be profitable in and our ability to achieve sustained profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to perform under our collaborations at the expected cost  expand or continue existing collaborations  timing of additional investments in technology and the realization of value from the development and commercialization of products in which we have an economic interest  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contains forward looking statements reflecting management s current expectations regarding our future performance 
such expectations are based on certain assumptions regarding the progress of product development efforts under collaborative agreements  the executions of new collaborative agreements and other factors relating to our growth 
such expectations may not materialize if product development efforts are delayed or suspended  if negotiations with potential collaborators are delayed or unsuccessful or if other assumptions prove incorrect 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues for were million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
this increase is primarily due to the amortization of upfront fees of approximately million and fees for delivery of custom array tm sets of approximately million to pfizer inc and bayer ag and from other delivery fees earned from our collaborations 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue in totaled million  an increase of million or percent as compared to the increase in costs of revenue was attributable to increased costs for producing custom array tm sets for pfizer inc and bayer ag 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent for the year ended december  as compared to percent for the prior year 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales was higher in due to the higher gross margin on the pfizer collaboration and other economies of scale 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in were million  an increase of million or percent as compared to million in this increase is the result of our ongoing efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry capabilities and related proprietary technologies  including increased personnel  as we expand our lead optimization programs 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing and general administrative expenses in were million in  an increase of million or percent as compared to the increase was due primarily associated with increased administrative costs  including increased personnel  to support our growth during net investment income 
net investment income consists primarily of interest income partially offset by interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
investment income in was million as compared to million in  an increase of million or approximately percent 
interest expense in was million as compared to million in  resulting primarily from our higher average debt balance on our term loan with fleet national bank 
net income loss 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the same period in our net income in has been primarily attributable to increased revenue from our collaborator base 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for decreased million to million from million for the same period in this decrease reflected the completion of our collaborative agreements with roche and abbott  while not yet recognizing significant revenues from the collaborative agreements entered into with pfizer and bayer in we recorded million and million of revenue from roche in and  respectively 
we recorded no revenue from abbott in compared to million of revenue in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for increased million to million from million for the same period in this increase is primarily attributable to the overhead and depreciation related to additional facilities and scientific personnel and the necessary supplies and overhead expenses related to the delivery of the mapping array and directed array sets pursuant to our collaborative agreements  as well as approximately million of charges related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in november these charges primarily related to direct moving expenses as well as charges incurred to reserve for vacated space in medford 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for increased million to million from million for the same period in this increase is the result of our ongoing efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry capabilities and related proprietary technologies 
marketing  general and administrative expenses 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for decreased million to million from million for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a million reduction in the use of outside marketing and consulting services 
net investment income 
net investment income for decreased million to million from million for the same period in lower interest income in resulted primarily from lower amounts available for investment in net loss 
the net loss for was million as compared to a net loss of million for the same period in the net loss for is primarily attributable to decreased revenue  increased expenditures as we invested in new technologies to expand our drug discovery capabilities  and charges related to the relocation of our headquarters 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we held cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with a value of million  compared to million at december  our working capital at december  was million 
we have funded operations through december  with sales of common stock  payments from corporate collaborators  and the utilization of bank financing 
on march   we consummated a term loan agreement with fleet national bank to support our facilities expansion 
under this agreement  we borrowed million of the potential million available 
as of december   we have made principal payments of million and had an outstanding balance of million 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the same period in this decrease reflects primarily the timing of payments from our corporate collaborations 
cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million 
we had a use of cash of million from investing activities for the same period in during we completed our facility expansion in woburn  which included approximately million in tenant improvements 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the same period in in november  we completed a follow on offering of million shares of our common stock that raised million net of expenses 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with operating revenues and investment income will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the terms of such collaborations  the results of research and development  the need for currently unanticipated capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers for our products and services  or that such products and services will produce revenues adequate to fund our operating expenses 
if we experience increased losses  we may have to seek additional financing from public or private sales of our securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective dates of fasb statement  on a prospective basis for interim periods and fiscal years beginning january  had we implemented sfas no 
in the current period  financial position and results of operations would not have been affected 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  sab issued in december  summarizes certain of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the statements in the staff accounting bulletins represent interpretations and practices followed by the division of corporation finance and the office of the chief accountant in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws 
we adopted these sab during the fourth quarter of and results of operations were not affected 
subsequent events in january  we acquired camitro corporation  a privately held predictive modeling company based in menlo park  california 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of camitro s outstanding shares and the assumption of all of camitro s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the merger transaction was valued at million based on our share price on the measurement date for the merger 
the transaction will be accounted for as a purchase transaction 
in november  we exercised our options to purchase our building and the adjacent lot in woburn  massachusetts and in march we closed the transaction 
the total consideration paid for the properties was million  of which million represented the purchase price for the entire building and the land on which it sits and million represented the purchase price for the adjacent lot 
the purchase price was determined through an arms length negotiation with metro north corporate center llc and metro north corporate center llc ii  which are unaffiliated with us or any of our directors or executive officers 
we paid million in cash and granted a mortgage for the remainder of the purchase price through an extension of our existing term loan with fleet bank dated as of march   with an initial interest rate of 
the land upon which our facility sits is approximately acres  including a parking lot  while the adjacent parcel of land represents approximately acres 
we plan to continue to use our facility in its current capacity and may develop the adjacent parcel at a presently undetermined time in the future 
factors affecting future operating results our future operating results could differ materially from the results described above due to the risks and uncertainties described in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds and us government and other investment grade debt securities 
these investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
additionally  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with fleet national bank primarily to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our cash flows 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations from likely changes in interest rates is not material 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s use of derivatives and other financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short term maturities of these instruments
