item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations terminated merger with utilicorp empire and utilicorp united inc  a delaware corporation utilicorp  entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated as of may  the merger agreement  which provided for a merger of our company with and into utilicorp  with utilicorp being the surviving corporation 
the merger was conditioned  among other things  upon approvals of various federal and state regulatory agencies  with either company having the right to terminate the merger agreement if all regulatory approvals were not obtained by december  all approvals were not received by this date and utilicorp notified us on january  that it was exercising its right to terminate the merger agreement 
on july   the ferc granted conditional approval to the merger 
on december   the company received an order from the administrative law judge alj of the arkansas public service commission ruling that the proposed regulatory plan not be approved 
in addition  the alj stated that he was unable to separate the application for approval of the merger and the proposed regulatory plan  and therefore could not conclude that the merger was consistent with the public interest  the standard for merger approval in arkansas 
on december   the arkansas public service commission issued an order adopting and affirming the december  order without modification 
on december   we and utilicorp filed for a rehearing with the arkansas public service commission 
the oklahoma corporation commission approved the proposed merger on december  but did not address the proposed regulatory plan  indicating that such issues would be addressed if raised in future rate proceedings 
the missouri public service commission approved the proposed merger on december  but rejected the proposed regulatory plan 
the kansas corporation commission had not yet ruled on the proposed merger and regulatory plan when the merger agreement was terminated by utilicorp on january  as a result of the termination of the merger by utilicorp  approximately million in merger related expenses that were not tax deductible when incurred by us  have now become deductible 
this deduction was taken in january  decreasing income tax expense and increasing operating income for the first quarter of by approximately million 
results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of our total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers and from wholesale off system transactions 
the remainder of such revenues were derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total system kwh sales and revenues for our on system customers increased during primarily due to above average temperatures in august and september of as well as unseasonably cold temperatures in november and december of customer growth in remained at the same rate as experienced in residential kwh sales increased with revenues increasing as compared to primarily due to the weather conditions described above 
commercial kwh sales increased with revenues increasing due to these weather conditions as well as continued increases in business activity throughout our service territory 
industrial classes also showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues due to continued increases in business activity throughout our service territory 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased in  reflecting these weather conditions 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
this clause permits the pass through to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs 
kwh sales for our on system customers increased slightly during while revenues increased slightly more than the corresponding increase in kwh sales 
customer growth increased slightly in over the growth rate in despite above average temperatures in july and august of  residential kwh sales decreased with revenues decreasing as compared to this decrease was primarily due to unusually mild temperatures during the second quarter of  as well as in september  november and december  and the unusually warm second and third quarters of commercial and industrial classes showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues due to continued increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory 
on system wholesale kwh sales were down slightly in  reflecting the mild temperatures 
revenues associated with these sales decreased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
on november   we filed a request with the missouri public service commission for a general annual increase in rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
this request is to allow us to recover expenses resulting from significantly higher natural gas prices than the levels contemplated by our existing rates as well as our investment in the combined cycle unit currently under construction at the state line power plant and other plant additions which have occurred since our last rate increase in september the missouri commission has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for may  through june  any rate increase approved as a result of the filing would not become effective before late in the third quarter of we cannot predict the extent of any increase which might be granted as a result of this filing 
because of the timing of the decision with respect to the november request and the resulting delay in recovery of permanent rates as well as the expectation of continuing high natural gas prices and increased gas usage when the state line combined cycle unit begins operation  we filed a request with the missouri public service commission on february  for an interim increase in rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
we asked for this increase to be collected between march  and september   when we anticipate the permanent case could be concluded 
on march  the missouri commission dismissed the interim case stating that empire had failed to show that it was facing an emergency or near emergency situation  the standard for interim relief  and as a result no interim rate increase was granted 
we will continue to actively pursue the permanent rate case described above 
in addition to sales to our own customers  we sell power to other utilities as available and provide transmission service through our system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during revenues from such off system transactions were approximately million as compared to approximately million in and approximately million during  despite a decline in kwh sales for both years 
the increase in revenues during while kwh sales were declining was primarily the result of the ability to sell power at market based rates 
pursuant to orders issued by the ferc and subsequent tariffs filed by us and spp  these off system sales have been opened up to competition 
see competition below for more information on these open access tariffs 
our future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  weather  fuel costs  regulation  the utilities change from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers and our ability to receive adequate and timely rate relief 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total purchased power costs increased by approximately million during reflecting increased demand in the third and fourth quarters of decreased availability of some of our generating units during the third quarter of and escalating natural gas prices which at times made it more economical to purchase power than to run our gas fired units  particularly in september added to the increase in purchased power 
the riverton plant s coal fired unit no 
was out of service for its scheduled fall outage from september to november and unit no 
 also coal fired  was out of service for its scheduled fall outage from september to october the state line plant s unit no 
was taken out of service on september to begin its transformation into a combined cycle unit and will be out of service until the combined cycle unit goes into commercial operation  which is scheduled for june total fuel costs were up approximately million during as compared to the same period in primarily reflecting the increased generation from the gas turbines at the energy center and the state line power plant in the fourth quarter of the extremely cold temperatures in december resulted in a significant increase in the price of purchased power  making it more economical for us to run our gas fired turbines 
in addition  escalating natural gas prices made it more economical for the energy center to run its dual fuel turbines mainly on oil in december 
natural gas prices were higher by during as compared to merger related expenses  which were not tax deductible when they were incurred  were million less during as compared to other operating expenses increased approximately million during  compared to  mainly due to a million addition to the bad debt reserve in the third quarter 
maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during primarily due to decreased maintenance on the combustion turbines at energy center as well as decreased levels of distribution maintenance 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total provision for income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income 
see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes decreased approximately million during the year 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
merger related expenses  which were not tax deductible when they were incurred  contributed million to this increase 
total purchased power costs decreased by approximately million during  primarily due to increased availability of our generating units 
the asbury plant set a new continuous run record of days in total fuel costs were up approximately million during as compared to the same period in primarily reflecting the increased generation from the gas turbines at the state line power plant 
the hot temperatures in july and august resulted in a significant increase in the price of purchased power  making it more economical for us to run our gas turbines during those months 
in addition  natural gas prices were higher by during as compared to  contributing to the increase 
other operating expenses decreased slightly by approximately million during  compared to maintenance and repairs expense decreased approximately million during primarily due to decreased maintenance costs at asbury and riverton 
the riverton plant had a five year scheduled maintenance outage in these decreases offset maintenance and repairs expense resulting from a new year s day ice storm that interrupted service to approximately  of our missouri and kansas customers over a three day period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income during see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year largely as a result of increased property taxes 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during  and during afudc increased significantly during reflecting higher levels of construction work in progress related to the state line project 
afudc increased during over the same period in  also reflecting the higher levels of construction work in progress due mainly to the state line project 
see note of notes to financial statements under item total afudc will decrease following the completion of the state line project scheduled for june interest charges on long term debt increased million during due to the issuance of million of our unsecured senior notes in november interest charges on long term debt increased million during as compared to the prior year due to the issuance of million of our first mortgage bonds in april as well as the senior notes in november the proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay short term indebtedness  including approximately million in commercial paper incurred in connection with our preferred stock redemption on august   as well as that incurred in connection with our construction program 
the proceeds from our first mortgage bonds were added to our general funds and were used to repay million of our first mortgage bonds due may  and to repay short term indebtedness  including that incurred in connection with our construction program 
commercial paper interest decreased million during the year due to decreased usage of short term debt for financing purposes 
interest income increased million  reflecting the higher balances of cash available for investment 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in excluding merger related expenses  earnings per share would have been during compared to in earnings per share  although higher because of favorable weather conditions  increased afudc and decreased merger expenses  were negatively impacted by significantly increased natural gas prices and purchased power costs 
basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in earnings per share were down primarily due to the million in merger costs incurred during  as well as million in excess consideration paid on redemption of our preferred stock 
earnings for were also negatively impacted by mild temperatures and increased interest expense 
excluding the million in merger costs  earnings per share would have been 
we anticipate that assuming normal weather conditions and continued high natural gas prices  our earnings in are likely to decline until we receive adequate and timely rate relief as a result of the permanent rate increase we are seeking as disclosed above 
in addition  earnings for the first quarter of will reflect the reversal of the non deductibility of merger related expenses as discussed above 
this will have the effect of increasing net income for the first quarter by approximately million 
earnings for the first quarter of will also reflect million of expenses related to severance benefits incurred under our change in control severance pay plan 
competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  oklahoma and arkansas are the only states in which we operate that have taken any such action 
in missouri  the public service commission adopted an order in establishing a docket and creating a task force on retail electric competition 
no legislative action has yet been taken and none is expected during the current year 
in kansas  although different bills have been introduced into the house and senate  no legislative action has been taken 
in oklahoma  the electric restructuring act of was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor 
the bill  with a target date of july   was designed to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state and move the state toward open competition for electric generation 
an electric utility task force was formed to study all issues in oklahoma and to prepare legislation to provide a more comprehensive framework for the transition to retail open access 
that legislation was defeated during the oklahoma legislature s session but will be debated again in the session 
the target date of july  remains intact but an extension of this date will also be debated 
the arkansas legislature passed a bill in april that would deregulate the state s electricity industry as early as january the bill would freeze rates for three years for residential and small business customers of utilities that seek to recover stranded costs  and freeze rates for one year for residential and small business customers of utilities  such as us  that do not seek to recover stranded costs 
the staff of the arkansas public service commission filed testimony in october recommending that the commission encourage the legislature to extend the date for retail open access beyond the current statutory deadline of june  a bill supported by legislative leaders and the governor was introduced in january the bill was enacted in february and will delay deregulation until october and give the commission authority to set further delays in one year increments until october approximately of our retail electric revenue for was derived from sales subject to arkansas regulation 
in april  the ferc issued order no 
which required all electric utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services that they provide themselves 
the utility would have to take service under those tariffs for its own wholesale power transactions 
order required a functional unbundling of transmission and power marketing services 
we and the southwestern power pool spp have filed open access transmission tariffs covering these wholesale transmission services 
the spp tariff applies to most of the transmission services for which our tariff was designed 
where that is the case  we share revenues received from such transmission services with other members of the spp based on a megawatt mile method of calculating transmission service charges 
there are  however  limited circumstances where our tariff still applies and we receive of the revenues from the transmission services 
the spp tariff will continue to apply unless and until a new tariff is filed as part of any regional transmission organization  or rto  which we may join as discussed below 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
which encourages the development of rtos 
rtos are designed to control the wholesale transmission services of the utilities in its region 
order is intended to continue the process of promoting open and more competitive markets in bulk power sales of electricity that was begun with order the spp filed with the ferc on december  for rto status 
this filing was rejected by the ferc as not meeting certain requirements of its order the spp filed a second request in the fourth quarter of addressing the ferc s concerns and continuing to seek rto status 
the ferc has not yet ruled on the modified filing 
we do not expect the implementation of order to have a significantly different impact on our results of operations than the implementation of order and the operation of the spp tariff had 
several factors exist which may enhance our ability to compete if deregulation occurs 
historically  we have been able to generate and purchase power relatively inexpensively 
despite the increased natural gas prices and purchased power costs during  our retail rates were still approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  less than of our electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling 
our reliance on purchased power should also be diminished when the state line combined cycle unit becomes operational later this year 
we are continuing our investments in non regulated businesses which we commenced in we now lease capacity on our broadband fiber optics network and provide electronic monitored security  decorative lighting and other energy services 
liquidity and capital resources our construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
a breakdown of our construction expenditures is as follows construction expenditures amounts in millions new construction state line combined cycle unit distribution and transmission system additions combustion turbine improvements and upgrades additions and replacements asbury and riverton capitalized software costs fiber optics general and other additions total approximately of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations 
the other of such requirements were satisfied from short term borrowings and the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in november the unusually low percentage of these requirements that was satisfied internally from operations was due primarily to increased construction expenditures in we estimate that our construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  we anticipate that we will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to our distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these construction expenditure estimates also include approximately million  million and million in  and respectively  for the combined cycle unit at the state line power plant 
the total cost of this construction expansion project is estimated to be million 
our share of this amount is approximately million before considering our contribution of of already existing property 
however  after the transfer to westar generating of an undivided joint ownership interest in the existing state line unit no 
and certain other property at book value as described below  our net cash requirement is expected to be approximately million  excluding afudc 
for more information on the combined cycle unit see item  properties electric facilities 
work is continuing and the combined cycle unit is projected to be placed into commercial operation by the target date of june we experienced a tightening labor market for required skilled craftsmen during the third and fourth quarters of which resulted in increased project labor costs 
the project is now fully staffed with the required skilled craftsmen and work is continuing 
in april  we placed one of our contractors at the state line power plant in default of its contract and awarded completion of the work to another 
the contractor in default petitioned for arbitration  claiming that its contract was not terminated for fault but rather at our convenience and sought certain damages 
we responded with a claim of our own against the contractor 
the dispute was settled to both parties satisfaction through mediation in january westar generating is responsible for of our expenditures made in connection with the construction and operation of the combined cycle unit 
in addition  westar generating had been making monthly prepayments to us  the last of which was made in october these prepayments were for the future transfer to westar generating of its joint ownership interest in the existing state line unit no 
 as well as an interest in certain underlying and surrounding land and other property and equipment now owned by us 
the missouri and arkansas commissions have approved our application for permission to sell and transfer an interest in these assets to westar generating 
the transfer of these assets is scheduled for march the prepayments are reflected in state line advance payments on the balance sheet
