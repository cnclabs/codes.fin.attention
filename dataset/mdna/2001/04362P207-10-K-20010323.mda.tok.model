item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the company s future financial performance  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview informix corporation is a global provider of information management software through its two operating businesses  informix software and ascential software 
informix software  the database company  develops  markets and supports object relational and relational database management systems for data warehousing  transaction processing and e business applications 
ascential software is a supplier of information asset management software and solutions to enterprises and government organizations worldwide 
during the second half of  informix corporation undertook a strategic realignment to transition from five former business units into the two operating businesses 
by december   we defined and allocated personnel among the management  selling  marketing  research and development and service organizations for the two operating businesses 
however  the core infrastructure groups of informix corporation operations  finance and administration have been retained by informix software and these groups will continue to provide services to both operating businesses through much of our intent continues to be to create two separate publicly traded companies when market conditions permit 
we have not achieved sufficient separation of the employees and infrastructure of the two operating businesses to properly measure the results of the operations on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  although we present the separate revenue information for the two operating businesses on a historical basis  we do not present separate historical operating income information 
we intend to disclose the results of operations based on the two operating businesses on a prospective basis 
on march   we acquired ardent software  inc ardent  a leading provider of data integration infrastructure software for data warehouse  business intelligence  and e business applications 
in the acquisition  the former shareholders of ardent received shares of our common stock in exchange for each outstanding ardent share and we assumed all outstanding ardent options and warrants 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  all historical financial information has been restated to include ardent 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded merger  realignment and other charges of million  during of which million related to non cash charges 
as of december   we had made cash payments of million related to the million charge and expect to make additional cash payments of approximately million during the first half of in addition to the million charge  we expect to incur further realignment charges during the first half of of approximately million for primarily employee compensation related costs 
we expect to realize total quarterly expense reduction of approximately million as a result of this realignment and approximately of this expected amount represents cash savings with the balance attributable to reductions in non cash depreciation and amortization 
the expected quarterly expense reduction began during the quarter ended december  but the full effect will not be realized until the quarter ended june  the expected quarterly expense reduction is estimated to reduce specific quarterly expense components as follows cost of software distribution  million  cost of services  million  sales and marketing  million  research and development  million  general and administrative  million 
these realignment and other charges are subject to continuing review and adjustment as we implement the realignment 
results of operations the following table and discussion compares the results of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  percent of net revenues net revenues licenses services total net revenues cost and expenses cost of software distribution cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative write off of acquired research and development merger and restructuring charges total expenses operating income loss net income loss revenues we derive revenues from licensing software and providing post license technical product support and updates to customers and from consulting and education services 
our revenue recognition policy is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
license revenues 
license revenues may involve the shipment of product by us or the granting of a license to a customer to manufacture products 
our products are sold directly to end user customers or through resellers  including oems  distributors and value added resellers vars 
revenue from license agreements with resellers is recognized as earned by us  generally  when the licenses are resold or utilized by the reseller and all of our related obligations have been satisfied 
accordingly  amounts received from customers in advance of revenue being recognized are recorded as a liability in advances from customers in our financial statements 
advances in the amount of million and million had not been recognized as earned revenue as of december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december   we received million in customer advances and recognized revenue from resellers with previously recorded customer advances of million 
included in the million recognized were million of licenses that were resold or utilized by the reseller  million related to contractual reductions in customer advances and million related to previously deferred revenue for solution sales  which has now been recognized as services have been completed 
during and  we recognized revenue of million and million  respectively  as a result of contractual reductions in customer advances 
contractual reductions result from settlements between us and resellers in which the customer advance contractually expires or a settlement is structured wherein the rights to resell our products terminate without sell through or deployment of the software 
our license transactions can be relatively large in size and difficult to forecast both in timing and dollar value 
as a result  license transactions have caused fluctuations in net revenues and net income loss because of the relatively high gross margin on such revenues 
as is common in the industry  a disproportionate amount of our license revenue is derived from transactions that close in the last weeks or last few days of a quarter 
the timing of closing large license agreements also increases the risk of quarter to quarter fluctuations 
we expect that these types of transactions and the resulting fluctuations in revenue will continue 
service revenues 
service revenues are comprised of maintenance  consulting and education revenues 
maintenance contracts generally call for us to provide technical support and software updates to customers 
the following table and discussion compares the revenues for the businesses of informix software and ascential software for the years ended december   and in millions informix software license revenues service revenues maintenance revenues consulting and education revenues total service revenues total revenues informix software license revenues as a percent of total revenues service revenues as a percent of total revenues ascential software license revenues service revenues maintenance revenues consulting and education revenues total service revenues total revenues ascential software license revenues as a percent of total revenues service revenues as a percent of total revenues informix corporation combined total of informix software and ascential software license revenues service revenues maintenance revenues consulting and education revenues total service revenues total revenues informix corporation  license revenues as a percent of total revenues service revenues as a percent of total revenues informix software revenues license revenues 
license revenues for decreased to million from million in the decrease in license revenues was due in large part to a significant decline in revenues from our traditional client server and tools products which we refer to as classic products and our enterprise database servers 
we believe that this decline is attributable to slower market demand for our classic products in the post yk environment and the failure of our sales and field marketing organizations to effectively market and sell our products due to a number of factors  including attrition and turnover in our sales and marketing organization  the announcement during the third quarter of our corporate restructuring and reorganization  and delays encountered in integrating certain of ardent s operations and products into our sales  product marketing and general operations 
in addition to this decline in license revenue in absolute dollars  our license revenue is also declining as a percentage of our total revenue 
although we do not expect this latter trend to continue  we are unable to predict whether market demand for our products will rebound in future quarters or whether our license revenues will continue to decline in absolute dollars 
license revenues for increased to million from million in this increase was primary a result of increased license revenues from our enterprise database servers 
this was driven by the introduction of several new products in the second half of  including the first release of informix internet foundation and a next generation release of informix dynamic server 
service revenues 
service revenues decreased to million in and increased to million in from million in service revenues accounted for   and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in the increase in maintenance revenues  was attributable primarily to the renewal of maintenance contracts and our growing installed customer base 
during  consulting and education revenues decreased to million primarily due to the decline in license revenues experienced in as consulting and education revenues are typically driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenues 
during  consulting and education revenues remained flat at million versus million in ascential software revenues license revenues 
license revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in the increase in was due principally to increased sales of ascential s content management product offerings  media and i 
reach  as well as increased sales of i 
sell  all of which experienced growth as part of their early life stage 
the increase during was driven primarily by increased sales of ascential s datastage product as well as the acquisition of prism solutions  inc prism by ardent 
service revenues 
service revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in service revenues accounted for   and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in maintenance revenues are increasing for ascential software as it continues to build its installed customer base 
consulting and education revenues increased to million in and increased to million in from million in consulting and education revenues are typically driven by engagements and projects associated with new license revenues 
costs and expenses as discussed above  our discussion and analysis of costs and expenses is presented on a combined basis for the two operating businesses 
cost of software distribution 
cost of software distribution consists primarily of manufacturing personnel costs  third party royalties  and amortization of previously capitalized software development costs and any write offs of previously capitalized software except during the quarter ended september   when we wrote off approximately million of capitalized software to merger  realignment and other charges for more information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost of software distribution increased slightly to million in from million in even though license revenues decreased during this increase was primarily due to an increase in third party royalties associated with increased license revenue from certain ascential software product offerings 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in capitalized software amortization as certain database products became fully amortized during and a decrease in manufacturing costs as we realized efficiencies due to the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
cost of software distribution increased during when compared to  which is in line with the increase in license revenues experienced during the same period  due to an increase in royalties and the write off of capitalized software costs 
during the third quarter of  approximately million of previously capitalized software costs were written down to the estimated net realizable value after it was determined that the projected sales of certain tools products and system management programs were not sufficient to realize the capitalized product development costs 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of maintenance  consulting and training personnel expenses 
cost of services decreased to million in from million in and service margins increased to in from in the decrease in cost of services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net service revenues is primarily due to cost containment actions that included headcount reductions as a result of the realignment and synergies realized from the ardent acquisition 
the increase in service margins experienced during was also due to the mix of service offerings  as there was a lower proportion of consulting and training revenue in  which generate significantly lower margins than maintenance 
cost of services increased to in from million in due primarily to increased headcount related costs incurred to support the increase in service revenues achieved during the period 
part of the increase in headcount resulted from the addition of prism s and red brick systems  inc s red brick consulting teams subsequent to the completion of the acquisitions in april and december  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  marketing and communications programs and related overhead costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in and to million in from million in the increase in was due primarily to increased marketing costs for advertising and marketing programs focused on promoting our internet based electronic commerce and business intelligence products and solutions 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to was primarily the result of increased advertising and marketing efforts in connection with the introduction of new products and our new corporate identity in order to increase brand awareness 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses experienced during was in line with the increase in revenues over the same period 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project consulting and related overhead costs for product development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in but as a percentage of net revenues remained consistent at for both and due to the realization of cost containment efforts employed during  which included headcount reductions resulting from the realignment 
during  research and development expenses increased due to increased headcount related costs as a result of the acquisitions of prism and red brick in april and december  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of finance  legal  information systems  human resources  bad debt expense and related overhead costs 
during  general and administrative expenses increased million to million from million in and million in as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent at  and in  and respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses experienced during was caused by increased bad debt and legal expenses offset by a decrease in employee related costs 
bad debt expense increased approximately million as a result of increased reserves against defaults by technology start up companies  write offs of certain receivables acquired in the merger with ardent and reserves related to several eastern european government entities where recent political changes make collection no longer probable 
the increase in legal expenses was related primarily to a million reserve with respect to the unidata lawsuit and million paid to cincom systems  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements 
write off of acquired research and development 
in process research and development represents the estimated fair value of incomplete technologies acquired by us for our own development efforts 
in connection with ardent s acquisition of prism in april  ardent recorded a charge of approximately million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development expense that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
in connection with our acquisition of red brick in december  we recorded a charge of million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development expense that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with the assumptions used at the time of the prism and red brick acquisitions 
the assumptions primarily consisted of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections once the products had entered the market 
merger  realignment and other charges 
during the second half of  we recorded a charge of million mostly to account for the actions taken to realign our operational structure into two separate companies and to refine our product strategy 
included in this charge was million for severance and employment related costs  million for the write off of goodwill and intangible assets  million for the closure of facilities and equipment costs  million for costs to exit various commitments and programs  million of miscellaneous other charges and a credit of approximately million for adjustments recorded in order to reduce previously accrued merger and restructuring charges primarily for a decrease in estimated facility costs related to the merger with ardent 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million associated with the merger with ardent 
of this amount  approximately million related to integration and transition costs incurred during the quarter ended march  also included in the million was approximately million of accrued merger and restructuring costs which consisted of the following components million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees related to the merger  million for severance and employment related costs  million for the closure of facilities and equipment costs and million for the write off of redundant technology and other duplicate costs 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million associated with the merger with cloudscape 
this amount included million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees related to the merger and million for costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies  including expenditures of million for severance and related costs  million for closure of facilities and million for the write off of redundant assets 
during the quarter ended june   ardent adopted a formal plan to exit the operations of o technologies  inc  which had been acquired by ardent in december  and recorded a charge of million for accrued restructuring charges 
the charge was comprised of million for asset impairment  million for severance and related costs and million for facility closings and other obligations 
during the quarter ended march   ardent recorded a charge of million associated with the merger with unidata 
the charge included million for financial advisor  legal and accounting fees  million for severance and related costs  million for closure of facilities  and million for the write off of redundant assets 
during and  adjustments of million and million  respectively  were recorded to the results of operations which appear as a credit to merger  realignment and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and  to adjust the estimated severance and facility components of the restructuring charge to actual costs incurred 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income expense interest income 
interest income for increased million or to million from million for both and this increase was due in part to the increase in interest rates experienced during as well as an increase in the average interest bearing cash and short term investment balances held during when compared to the same periods in and during the first nine months of  we maintained higher short term investment balances than in previous years as a result of increased operating cash flows 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for from million and million for and  respectively 
interest expense of million incurred during related primarily to interest charges on capital lease payments 
the decrease experienced during was due primarily to a decline in the interest charges related to the line of credit which was terminated effective december  the decrease during when compared to was due to a decrease in the financing of customer accounts receivable and a decrease in interest charges related to payments on capital leases 
we did not enter into any accounts receivable financing transactions during  and interest charges related to payments on capital leases have been declining each year as we have not been entering into new capital lease arrangements 
litigation settlement expense 
during  we incurred a charge of million in connection with our entering into a memorandum of understanding regarding the settlement of the private securities and related litigation against us 
the charge consisted of million in cash and million in common stock for settlement expenses plus approximately million in legal fees required to obtain and complete the settlement 
the charge excludes approximately million of insurance proceeds which  according to the terms of the memorandum of understanding  were contributed directly by our insurance carriers 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased million to million in from million in for  other income included approximately million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments and approximately million of vat refunds received in china 
other income expense  net  increased to million for from a net other expense of million for for  other income included approximately million of net realized gains on the sale of long term investments  offset by a downward adjustment of million to the carrying value of certain investments and approximately million of net foreign currency transaction losses 
during  other income expense included million of foreign currency transaction losses 
income taxes income tax expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  resulted primarily from foreign withholding taxes and taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions 
quarterly operating results first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss    preferred stock dividend net income loss applicable to common stockholders    net income loss per common share basic diluted year ended december  net revenues     gross profit     net income loss     preferred stock dividend net income loss applicable to common stockholders     net income loss per common share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  the decrease of million from million at december   was primarily caused by the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for approximately million and the payment of approximately million of costs in connection with merger  realignment and other charges  including the million of charges recorded during aside from these items  we continue to generate cash from operations 
we will continue to invest in research and development activities as well as sales and marketing and product support 
our investment in property and equipment will continue as we purchase computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support and administrative staff 
during  capital expenditures totaled million 
as of december   we did not have any significant long term debt or significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
disclosures about market rate risk market rate risk 
the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of debt securities with an average maturity of less than two years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at december  and  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus would have had a million and million impact on the value of these securities in and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies primarily european and asian currencies until such receivables are collected and payables are disbursed 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such exchange 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables or payables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date which approximate the value and expected settlement date of the underlying transactions 
as these contracts are not designated and effective as hedges  discounts or premiums the difference between the spot exchange rate and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are recorded in earnings to other income expense  net at the time of purchase  and changes in market value of the underlying contract are recorded in earnings as foreign exchange gains or losses in the period in which they occur 
we operate in certain countries in latin america  eastern europe  and asia pacific where there are limited forward foreign currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged exposures in these currencies 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is relatively long  depending on a number of factors including the level of competition and the size of the transaction 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount contract amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate at december  and the forward rate 
all contracts mature within twelve months 
forward contracts weighted average at december  contract amount contract rate fair value in thousands in thousands forward currency to be sold under contract euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  taiwan dollar  korean won   swiss franc  german deutschmark  singapore dollar  south african rand  french franc  thailand bhat  czech koruna  other individually less than million  total  forward currency to be purchased under contract british pound  other individually less than million total  grand total  not meaningful european monetary conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic community entered into a three year transition phase during which a common currency  the euro  was introduced 
between january  and january   governments  companies and individuals may conduct business in these countries in both the euro and existing national currencies 
on january   the euro will become the sole currency in these countries 
during the transition phase  we will continue to evaluate the impact of conversion to the euro on our business 
in particular  we are reviewing whether our internal software systems can process transactions denominated either in current national currencies or in the euro  including converting currencies using computation methods specified by the european economic community  the cost to us if we must modify or replace any of our internal software systems  and whether we will have to change the terms of any financial instruments in connection with our hedging activities based on current information and our evaluation to date  we do not expect the cost of any necessary corrective action to have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have reviewed the effect of the conversion to the euro on the prices of our products in the affected countries 
as a result  we have made some adjustments to our prices to attempt to eliminate differentials that were identified 
however  we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and other possible effects of the conversion to the euro on our business 
we cannot guarantee that the costs associated with conversion to the euro or price adjustments will not in the future have a material adverse effect on our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of the initial adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our operations or financial position 
factors that may affect future results current and potential stockholders should consider carefully each of the following factors in making their investment decisions 
these factors should be considered together with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
risk factors recent organizational changes could disrupt our business operations  adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products and materially adversely affect our financial results 
beginning in august  we began a comprehensive reorganization and restructuring of our company and business operations  including  among other things  consolidating our five operating business groups into two wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
in addition  during the quarter ended september   we moved our corporate headquarters from menlo park  california to westborough  massachusetts and we formalized plans to reduce total headcount to approximately  and to consolidate certain physical locations in california and elsewhere 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the reorganization and restructuring 
moreover  it has and may in the future cause significant disruptions of our daily business operations  including the loss of key personnel and other employees necessary for us to effectively operate at all levels 
disruptions or operational difficulties could result in delays in product development cycles and sales of our products 
in addition  we may not be able to create two separate  publicly traded companies as a result of financial market conditions  a decrease in demand for our product offerings and other conditions beyond our control 
the occurrence of one or more of these factors could distract our management team and materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
we may not be able to retain our key personnel during our ongoing reorganization and restructuring and attract and retain the new personnel necessary to grow the two new operating companies  which could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our products  support our business operations and grow our businesses 
our future success depends on retaining the services of key personnel in all functional areas of our company  including engineering  sales  marketing  consulting and corporate services 
for instance  we may be unable to continue to develop and support technologically advanced products and services if we fail to retain and attract highly qualified engineers  and to market and sell those products and services if we fail to retain and attract well qualified marketing and sales professionals 
we may be unable to retain key individuals in all of these areas during our reorganization and restructuring and we may not succeed in attracting new employees to one or both of the new operating companies after the completion of the restructuring 
the competition for experienced  well qualified personnel in the software industry is intense  especially in the san francisco and boston metropolitan areas 
our ongoing reorganization and restructuring may make it difficult for us to compete effectively for the services of these individuals 
if we fail to retain  attract and motivate key employees  we may be unable to complete the reorganization and restructuring  develop  market and sell new products  support the operations of the two new operating companies and sustain and grow the two businesses in the future  the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our operating and financial results 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors  which could result in our failing to achieve revenue or profitability expectations 
our quarterly and annual results of operations have varied significantly in the past and are likely to continue to vary in the future due to a number of factors described below and elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section  many of which are beyond our control 
any one or more of the factors listed below or other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our revenue or profitability expectations 
in particular  the failure to meet market expectations could cause a sharp drop in our stock price 
these factors include changes in demand for our products and services  including changes in growth rates in the industry as a whole and in the traditional database market and the relatively new business intelligence and electronic commerce markets in particular  the size  timing and contractual terms of large orders for our software products  adjustments of delivery schedules to accommodate customer or regulatory requirements  the budgeting cycles of our customers and potential customers  the reaction of our customers and potential customers to our ongoing reorganization and restructuring  any downturn in our customers businesses  in the domestic economy or in international economies where our customers do substantial business  changes in our pricing policies resulting from competitive pressures  such as aggressive price discounting by our competitors or other factors  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products and solutions  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  and seasonal buying patterns which tend to peak in the fourth quarter 
our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations which may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our common stock may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares above the price at which they purchased their shares 
stock prices and trading volumes for many software companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  as occurred in the quarter ended september   our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this were to occur again  the market price of our common stock would likely decrease significantly again 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of market uncertainty about the company s business prospects as a result of our ongoing reorganization and restructuring  market uncertainty about the company s business prospects or the prospects for the relational database management systems rdbms and object relational database management systems ordbms markets  the business intelligence software market and the electronic commerce software solutions market  revenues or results of operations that do not meet or exceed analysts expectations  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  and general business conditions in the software industry 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses 
despite efforts to manage foreign exchange risk  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as a consequence  we may incur losses in connection with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our international revenue and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  we do so only on an annual basis  resulting in substantial pricing exposure as a result of foreign exchange volatility during the period between annual pricing reviews 
in addition  as noted previously  the sales cycles for our products is relatively long 
foreign currency fluctuations could  therefore  result in substantial changes in the financial impact of a specific transaction between the time of initial customer contact and revenue recognition 
we have implemented a foreign exchange hedging program consisting principally of the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts in the primary european and asian currencies 
this program is intended to hedge the value of intercompany accounts receivable or intercompany accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies against fluctuations in exchange rates until such receivables are collected or payables are disbursed 
additionally  uncertainties related to the euro conversion could adversely affect our hedging activities 
if the rdbms and the ordbms markets decline or do not grow  we may sell fewer database products and our separate database operating business may be unable to sustain its current level of operations 
if the growth rates for rdbms or ordbms  respectively  decline for any reason  there will be less demand for informix software products  which would have a negative impact on our business and financial results 
in particular  we cannot predict whether the sharp decline in revenue derived from licenses of these products during the year ended december  will continue 
if it does  our financial results will be materially adversely affected 
declining demand for such products could threaten informix software s ability to sustain its present level of operations or to meet our expectations for future growth 
delays in market acceptance of our ordbms products could also result in fewer product sales 
in recent years  the types and quantities of data required to be stored and managed has grown increasingly complex and includes  in addition to conventional character data  audio  video  text and three dimensional graphics in a high performance scaleable environment 
we have invested substantial resources in developing our ordbms product line 
the market for ordbms products is new and evolving  and its growth depends upon a growing need to store and manage complex data and upon broader market acceptance of our products as a solution for this need 
organizations may not choose to make the transition from conventional rdbms products to ordbms products 
if the business intelligence and data warehouse markets do not continue to grow  or if our product offerings in these markets are not accepted  we may not be able to sell our products or grow our operating businesses 
the business intelligence and data warehouse markets may not continue to grow  or may not grow rapidly  and our customers may not expand their use of data warehouse and business intelligence products 
in addition  we may not be able to market and sell our products in these markets or otherwise compete effectively and generate significant revenue 
although demand for data warehouse and business intelligence software has grown in recent years  the markets are still emerging 
our future financial performance in this area and the success of both of our operating businesses will depend to a large extent on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting data warehouses  our success in developing partnering arrangements with developers of software tools and applications for the data warehouse and business intelligence markets  existing customers expanding their use of data warehouses  and the success of ascential software in developing and selling solutions for the business intelligence market 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and solutions or grow our two operating businesses 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and or future competitors and such inability could impair our ability to sell our products 
the market for our products and solutions is highly competitive  diverse and is subject to rapid change 
in particular  we expect that the technology underlying database solutions and products for the internet and business intelligence needs will continue to change rapidly 
for example  as customers embrace the internet  ascential software will need to develop and enhance software solutions to support internet applications 
it is possible that our products and solutions will be rendered obsolete by technological advances 
in addition  it is possible that demand for our traditional database products may decline sharply as customers demand more comprehensive software solutions  thereby jeopardizing our ability to grow the business of informix software 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including several large vendors that develop and market databases  applications  development tools  decision support products  consulting services and or complete database driven solutions for the internet 
our principal competitors for informix software include computer associates  ibm  microsoft  ncr teradata  oracle and sybase 
our principal competitors for ascential software include ibm  informatica  bulldog  hummingbird  sagent  cognos and artesia and small  highly focused companies offering single products or services that we include as part of an overall solution 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  evolving markets and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
if the internet does not develop as a market for our solutions offerings  we may not be able to grow ascential software into a viable independent operating business 
the internet is a rapidly evolving market 
we are unable to predict whether and to what extent internet computing and electronic commerce will be embraced by consumers and traditional businesses 
our successful introduction of database driven products and solutions for the internet market will depend in large measure on the commitment by hardware and software vendors to manufacture  promote and distribute internet access appliances  the lower cost of ownership of internet computing relative to client server architecture  and the ease of use and administration of the internet relative to client server architecture 
in addition  if a sufficient number of vendors do not undertake a commitment to the internet  the market may not accept internet computing or internet computing may not generate significant revenues for our business 
also  standards for network protocols  as well as other industry adopted and de facto standards for the internet  are evolving rapidly 
there can be no assurance that standards we have chosen will position our products to compete effectively for business opportunities as they arise on the internet 
the widespread acceptance and adoption of the internet by traditional businesses for conducting business and exchanging information is likely only if the internet provides these businesses with greater efficiencies and improvements 
the failure of the internet to continue to develop as a commercial or business medium could materially adversely affect our business 
even if the internet and electronic commerce are widely accepted and adopted by consumers and businesses  our database driven solutions for the internet may not succeed 
this market is new to our product development  marketing and sales organizations 
we may not be able to market and sell products and solutions in this market successfully 
in addition  our database driven solutions for the internet may not compete effectively with our competitors products and solutions 
further  we may not generate significant revenue and or margin in this market 
any of these events could materially  adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and our ability to create a separate  viable operating company 
competition may affect the pricing of our products or services  and changes in product mix may occur  either of which may reduce our margins 
existing and future competition or changes in our product or service pricing structure or product or service offerings could result in an immediate reduction in the prices of our products or services 
also  a significant change in the mix of software products and services that we sell  including the mix between higher margin software and maintenance products and lower margin consulting and training  could materially adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
in addition  the pricing strategies of competitors in the software database industry have historically been characterized by aggressive price discounting to encourage volume purchasing by customers 
we may not be able to compete effectively against competitors who continue to aggressively discount the prices of their products 
if we do not respond adequately to our industry s evolving technology standards or do not continue to meet the sophisticated needs of our customers  sales of our solutions or products may decline 
our future success will depend on our ability to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers by supporting existing and emerging hardware  software  database and networking platforms 
we will have to develop and introduce commercially viable enhancements to our existing products and solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
if we do not enhance our products to meet these evolving needs  we will not sell as many products and solutions and our position in existing  emerging or potential markets could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
in addition  commercial acceptance of our products and solutions could also be adversely affected by critical or negative statements or reports by brokerage firms  industry and financial analysts and industry periodicals about us  our products or business  or by the advertising or marketing efforts of competitors  or by other factors that could adversely affect consumer perception 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial financial and operational investment 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investment or to attract and retain qualified software development engineers 
in addition  we may not be able to internally develop new products or solutions quickly enough to respond to market forces 
as a result  we may have to acquire technology or access to products or solutions through mergers and acquisitions  investments and partnering arrangements 
we may not have sufficient cash  access to funding  or available equity to engage in such transactions 
moreover  we may not be able to forge partnering arrangements or strategic alliances on satisfactory terms  or at all  with the companies of our choice 
if a large number of the orders that are typically booked at the end of a quarter are not booked  our net income for that quarter could be substantially reduced 
our software license revenue in any quarter often depends on orders booked and shipped in the last month  weeks or days of that quarter 
at the end of each quarter  we typically have either minimal or no backlog of orders for the subsequent quarter 
if a large number of orders or several large orders do not occur or are deferred  revenue in that quarter could be substantially reduced 
seasonal trends in sales of our software products could adversely affect our quarterly operating results and lengthy sales cycles for products makes revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales of software products have been affected by seasonal purchasing trends that materially affect our quarter to quarter operating results 
we expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future 
revenue and operating results in our quarter ending december are typically higher relative to other quarters because many customers make purchase decisions based on their calendar year end budgeting requirements and because we measure our sales incentive plans for sales personnel on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we have historically experienced a substantial decline in revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year relative to the preceding quarter 
our sales cycles typically take many months to complete and vary depending on the product  service or solution that is being sold 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the size of a potential transaction and the level of competition that we encounter in our selling activities 
the sales cycle can be further extended for sales made through third party distributors 
our future revenue and our ability to make investments in developing our products is substantially dependent upon our installed customer base continuing to license our products and renew our service agreements 
we depend on our installed customer base for future revenue from services and licenses of additional products 
if our customers fail to renew their maintenance agreements  our revenue will be harmed 
the maintenance agreements are generally renewable annually at the option of the customers and there are no minimum payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
therefore  current customers may not necessarily generate significant maintenance revenue in future periods 
in addition  customers may not necessarily purchase additional products or services 
our services revenue and maintenance revenue also depend upon the continued use of these services by our installed customer base 
any downturn in software license revenue could result in lower services revenue in future quarters 
moreover  if either license revenue or revenue from services declines  we may not have sufficient cash to finance investments or acquire technology 
the success of our international operations is dependent upon many factors which could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally and could affect our profitability 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue during the year ended december  the international operations are  and any expanded international operations will be  subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally that could adversely affect our ability to sell our products internationally  and therefore  our profitability  including the following difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  uncertainties relative to regional  political and economic circumstances  recessionary environments in foreign economies  and increases in tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers imposed by foreign countries 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this would weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our success will continue to be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
these means of protecting proprietary rights may not be adequate  and the inability to protect intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business and or financial condition 
we currently hold united states patents and several pending applications 
there can be no assurance that any other patents covering our inventions will be issued or that any patent  if issued  will provide sufficiently broad protection or will prove enforceable in actions against alleged infringes 
our ability to sell our products and prevent competitors from misappropriating our proprietary technology and trade names is dependent upon protecting our intellectual property 
our products are generally licensed to end users on a right to use basis under a license that restricts the use of the products for the customer s internal business purposes 
we also rely on shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  which include a notice informing the end user that by opening the product packaging  or in the case of a click on license by clicking on an acceptance icon and downloading the product  the end user agrees to be bound by the license agreement 
despite such precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
in addition  we have licensed the source code of our products to certain customers under certain circumstances and for restricted uses 
in addition  we have also entered into source code escrow agreements with a number of our customers that generally require release of source code to the customer in the event the company enters bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or otherwise ceases to conduct business 
we may also be unable to protect our technology because competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology  policing unauthorized use of software is difficult  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights in software to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  shrink wrap and or click wrap licenses may be wholly or partially unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions  and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets  or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
in the future  third parties could  for competitive or other reasons  assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
as discussed in notes to the consolidated financial statements note litigation  in february  ibm filed a lawsuit against us claiming that some of our products infringe certain of ibm s patents ibm claim 
although we dispute ibm s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them  other third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
the ibm claim and these other claims  with or without merit  could harm our business by increasing costs and by adversely affecting our ability to sell our products 
any such claim  including the ibm claim  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
it is expected that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
our inability to rely on the statutory safe harbor as a result of the settlement of the sec investigation could harm our business 
in july  the sec issued a formal order of private investigation against us and certain unidentified other entities and persons with respect to accounting matters  public disclosures and trading activity in our securities that were not described in the formal order 
during the course of the investigation  we learned that the investigation concerned the events leading to the restatement of its financial statements  including fiscal years  and  that was publicly announced in november effective january   the sec and we entered into a settlement of the investigation against us 
pursuant to the settlement  we consented to the entry by the sec of an order instituting public administrative proceedings pursuant to section a of the securities act of and section c of the securities exchange act of  making findings  and imposing a cease and desist order 
pursuant to the order  we neither admitted nor denied the findings  except as to jurisdiction  contained in the order 
the order prohibits us from violating and causing any violation of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws  for example by making materially false and misleading statements concerning its financial performance 
the order also prohibits us from violating or causing any violation of the provisions of the federal securities laws requiring us to file accurate quarterly and annual reports with the sec  maintain accurate accounting books and records  and maintain adequate internal accounting controls 
pursuant to the order  we are also required to cooperate in the sec s continuing investigation of other entities and persons 
in the event that we violate the order  we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties 
as a consequence of the issuance of the january order  we will not  for a period of three years from the date of the issuance of the order  be able to rely on the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the federal securities laws 
the safe harbor  among other things  limits potential legal actions against us in the event a forward looking statement concerning our anticipated performance turns out to be inaccurate  unless it can be proved that  at the time the statement was made  we actually knew that the statement was false 
if we become a defendant in any private securities litigation brought under the federal securities laws  our legal position in the litigation could be materially adversely affected by our inability to rely on the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements 
other provisions in our charter documents may discourage potential acquisition bids and prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor 
other provisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor 
the provisions include elimination of the right of stockholders to act without holding a meeting  certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings  and a board of directors divided into three classes  with each class standing for election once every three years 
these provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control 
these provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and  accordingly  could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control 
such provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights but could  however  have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for shares of our common stock  and consequently  may also inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that grants holders of our common stock preferential rights in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt 
these rights are denied to any stockholder involved in the takeover attempt and this has the effect of requiring cooperation with our board of directors 
this may also prevent an increase in the market price of our common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts 
the rights agreement could also discourage potential acquirers from making unsolicited acquisition bids 
delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and prevent changes in its management that our stockholders may favor 
we are incorporated in delaware and are subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including those corporations  such as informix  whose securities are listed for trading on the nasdaq national market  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination would include  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving informix and an interested stockholder and the sale of more than of our assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the anti takeover provisions 
we do not intend to opt out of these anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
provisions in our charter documents with respect to undesignated preferred stock may discourage potential acquisition bids for informix 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to approximately  shares of undesignated preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by its stockholders 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including the loss of voting control to others
