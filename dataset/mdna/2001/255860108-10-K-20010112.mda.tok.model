while the company has operations in canada  mexico and the uk  historically only the operating results in mexico have been materially impacted by currency fluctuations 
there has been a significant devaluation of the mexican peso at least once in each of the last three decades  the last one being in august of in the short term after such devaluations  consumer confidence has been shaken  leading to an immediate reduction in revenues in the months following the devaluation 
then  after the immediate shock  and as the peso stabilizes  revenues tend to grow 
selling prices tend to rise over the long term to offset any inflationary increases in costs 
the peso  as well as any currency value  depends on many factors including international trade  investor confidence and government policy  to name a few 
these factors are impossible for the company to predict  and thus  an estimate of potential effect on results of operations for the future cannot be made 
this currency risk in mexico is presently managed through occassional foreign currency hedges  local currency financing and by export sales to the us denominated in us dollars 
overall revenues decreased  from the prior year 
the changes by segment are as follows increase decrease increase decrease in thousands total volume price mix consumer us  consumer foreign  industrial  the us consumer revenue decrease was strictly in the mass retail principally mega store market where customer consolidation and inventory reductions affected sales during the back to school buying season

as discussed above  us consumer revenue decreased significantly  yet operating profits only decreased  due to lower selling and administrative expenses from cost reduction efforts 
foreign operating profits increased  primarily due to higher revenues and more favorable foreign currency effects 
general corporate expenses were also reduced by  reflecting cost reduction activities 
the aforementioned gain on sale of assets relates to the sale of the graphite and lubricants division 
the provision for restructuring and related costs under the company s cost reduction program principally represents anticipated impairment losses due to plant closures and consolidation  as well as employee severance costs 
the aforementioned cost reduction efforts contributed to lower relative selling and administrative costs of sales in compared to of sales in 
minority interest minority interest represents of the net income of the consolidated subsidiary  grupo dixon  sa de sa  since september  and prior thereto   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  equivalent to the extent of the investment of the minority shareholders 
as described in note to consolidated financial statements  this minority interest was created by an initial public offering in effect of certain new accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
summarizing its views of applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company s policy of revenue recognition is consistent with this bulletin 
in  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which is effective for the company in fiscal this statement requires all derivative instruments to be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
the company currently uses cash flow hedges to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to occasionally hedge certain foreign currencies  but does not expect the prescribed accounting for these instruments to materially affect its financial position or results of operations when adopted 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows from operating activities improved dramatically by approximately million despite a net loss of  in fiscal the company s strict inventory control and reduction efforts in the us led to an increase in cash flows related to inventories of million in  as compared with a decrease of million in the prior year 
in addition  improved accounts payable management in the us and mexico and continued strong us accounts receivable collection practices more than offset the effects of higher mexico accounts receivable in the company s investing activities included approximately million in net purchases of property and equipment as compared with  in this was an historically lower level of purchases in the prior year and purchases include the acquisition of equipment for the start up of the company s china operation 
management believes that capital expenditures levels have been reduced over the past several years due to better capital budgeting and control and the continued use of leasing as an alternative to acquiring equipment 
generally  all major capital projects are discretionary in nature and thus no material purchase commitments exist 
capital expenditures will continue to be funded from operations and existing financing or new leasing arrangements 
total cash provided from investing activities decreased dramatically due to the cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the graphite and lubricants division in a note receivable from the sale in the amount of million was collected in the company s primary financing arrangements are with a consortium of lenders  providing a total of up to million in financing through september in august  certain financial covenants contained in the underlying loan and security agreements were revised to cure a previous default and to allow the company to execute its reorganization and consolidation plans  as well as other strategic initiatives 
the agreements were also amended to increase the rate of interest by and require the payment of certain fees  including an amendment fee of  the financing agreements  as amended  include a revolving line of credit facility in the amount of million which bears interest at either the prime rate plus  or the prevailing libor rate plus through september borrowings under the revolving credit facility are based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company s us and canada operations  as defined 
the company has executed an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the rate of interest on million of these borrowings at through august the loan and security agreements also include a term loan in the initial amount of million 
the term loan is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest  through september the loan bears interest based upon the same prevailing rate described above in connection with the revolving credit facility 
the company has previously executed an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the rate of interest on approximately million of the term loan at through may these financing arrangements are collateralized by the tangible and intangible assets of the us and canada operations including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  patents and trademarks and a pledge of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
the loan and security agreement contains provisions pertaining to the maintenance of certain financial ratios and annual capital expenditure levels  as well as restrictions as to payment of cash dividends 
as of september   the company is in compliance with all such provisions  as amended 
on january   the agreement was amended to revise one financial ratio requirement for the period ending december  due to the company s expectation that it would not meet the previous requirement as of that date 
as of september   the company had approximately million of unused lines of credit available under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company s mexico subsidiary has million in bank lines of credit million unused as of september  which bear interest at a rate based upon either a floating us bank rate or the rate of certain mexican government securities 
the company also has outstanding million of senior subordinated notes valued at their face amount  due in august  the subordinated note agreement was amended to revise certain financial covenants and cure a previous default  as well as to provide the company flexibility to execute its strategic initiatives

the amendment also required payment of a fee of  the note agreement  as amended  contains provisions that limit dividends and other payments  and require the maintenance of certain financial covenants and ratios 
the company is in compliance with all such provisions  as amended 
the company also incurred approximately  in legal costs associated with the aforementioned amendments to its senior and subordinated debt agreements 
the subordinated and senior debt have been classified  in accordance with their terms and management s expectations as to company performance  as long term in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
however  the company cannot assure that it will be in compliance with all covenant provisions of its debt agreements in all future quarters and cannot assure that it will receive waivers or amendments of any such provisions should that occur 
the company entered into the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements to balance and manage overall interest rate exposure and minimize overall cost of borrowings 
the swaps are not presently expected to have a material effect on total interest expense over the term of the underlying agreements 
in march  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the acquisition of up to million in dixon ticonderoga company stock 
under this program  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of million million in fiscal 
these repurchases were financed through the aforementioned and previous us revolving line of credit facilities 
refer to notes and to consolidated financial statements for further description of the aforementioned financing arrangements 
the existing sources of financing described above and cash expected to be generated from future operations and or asset sales would  in management s opinion  be sufficient to fulfill all current and anticipated requirements of the company s ongoing business and to meet all of it obligations 
however  if future covenant violations occur with respect to its current financing arrangements  the company may need to pursue other sources of financing to satisfy certain obligations before their due date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed elsewhere  the company is exposed to the following principal market risks ie risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates foreign exchange rates and interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in its international operations is principally limited to mexico and  to a lesser degree  canada 
approximately of the company s fiscal net revenues were derived in mexico and canada  combined exclusive of intercompany activities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the business unit s functional local currency 
it is estimated that a change in both the mexican peso and canadian dollar would impact reported operating profit by  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the changes in customer purchasing patterns or any adjustment to the company s financing or operating strategies in response to such a change in rates 
moreover  this measure does not take into account the possibility that these currency rates can move in opposite directions  such that gains from one may offset losses from another 
in addition  the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to changes in interest rates 
as of september   approximately of total short and long term debt is fixed  at rates between and 
the balance of the company debt is variable  principally based upon the prevailing us bank prime rate or libor rate 
certain interest rate swaps  which expire in and  fix the rate of interest on million of this debt at approximately 
a change in the average prevailing interest rates of the remaining debt of would not have a material effect upon the company s results of operations or cash flows 
this quantitative measure does not take into account the possibility that the prevailing rates us bank prime and libor can move in opposite directions and that the company has  in most cases  the option to elect either as the determining interest rate factor
