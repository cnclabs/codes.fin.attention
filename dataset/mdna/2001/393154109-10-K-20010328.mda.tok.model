the current indicated annual dividend is per share of common stock 
our current dividend policy reflects changes affecting the electric utility industry  which is moving away from the traditional cost of service regulatory model to a competition based market for power supply 
the current environment prompted us to reassess the appropriateness of our traditional dividend policy 
historically  we based our dividend policy on the continued validity of three assumptions the ability to achieve earnings growth  the receipt of an allowed rate of return that accurately reflects our cost of capital  and the retention of our exclusive franchise 
the company s board of directors will continue to assess and adjust the dividend  when appropriate  as the vermont electric industry evolves towards competition 
in addition  if other events beyond our control cause the company s financial situation to deteriorate further  the board of directors will also consider whether the current dividend level is appropriate or if the dividend should be reduced or eliminated

     item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in this section  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for green mountain power corporation the company and its subsidiaries 
this explanation includes factors that affect our business  our earnings and costs in the periods presented and why they changed between periods  the source of our earnings  our expenditures for capital projects and what we expect they will be in the future  where we expect to get cash for future capital expenditures  and how all of the above affects our overall financial condition 
there are statements in this section that contain projections or estimates and that are considered to be forward looking as defined by the securities and exchange commission the sec 
in these statements  you may find words such as believes  expects  plans  or similar words 
these statements are not guarantees of our future performance 
there are risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be different from those projected 
some of the reasons the results may be different are discussed under future outlook  transmission issues  environmental matters  rates and liquidity and capital resources in this section  and include regulatory and judicial decisions or legislation  weather  energy supply and demand and pricing  contractual commitments  availability  terms  and use of capital  general economic and business environment  nuclear and environmental issues  and industry restructuring and cost recovery including stranded costs 
these forward looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report 
earnings summary on january   the vermont public service board vpsb issued an order the settlement order approving a settlement between the company and the vermont department of public service the department that grants the company an immediate percent rate increase  and allows full recovery of power supply costs under the hydro quebec vermont joint owners vjo contract 
the settlement order paves the way for restoration of the company s investment grade status see retail rate cases and liquidity and capital resources in this section and gives the company an opportunity to earn its allowed rate of return during  or approximately per share 
during  the company lost per share of common stock  compared with a loss per share of in and a loss per share of in the loss represents a negative return on average common equity of percent 
the return on average common equity was negative percent in and negative percent in the loss from continuing operations was per share in  compared with earnings of per share in and a loss of in certain subsidiary operations  classified as discontinued in  lost per share in  compared with a loss of per share in and a loss of per share in the consolidated loss in was greater than the prior year consolidated loss as a result of the vpsb settlement order that disallowed recovery of million or per share in regulatory litigation costs and from higher power supply costs that were not recovered in rates 
power supply expense increased million in  outpacing revenue growth of million and reductions in depreciation and amortization expense of million 
the improvement in results from continuing operations was primarily due to three factors retail operating revenues increased by million  reflecting a percent temporary rate increase that went into effect on december   and a percent increase in sales to commercial and industrial customers in  operating costs were million lower in due to the company s termination of its corporate headquarters lease  reduced costs associated with the company s headquarters facilities and lower payroll expense reflecting mid year reductions in the number of employees  and results for reflected pretax charges of million in disallowed hydro quebec power costs for both and  compared with disallowed power costs of million for recorded in the earnings improvement was partially offset by a million increase in the capacity costs in associated with our long term hydro quebec power supply contract  an increase in the costs of short term power following the deregulation of energy markets in new england  as well as an increase in our costs to serve increased local loads and an increase of approximately million to supply power to meet contractual obligations under the company s december sell back agreement with hydro quebec  and a million increase in capacity costs associated with a contract with vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vermont yankee 
the company s discontinued operations lost in compared with a loss of in during  the company discontinued operations of mountain energy  inc mei  a subsidiary of the company that invests in wastewater  energy efficiency and generation businesses 
the loss in reflects the sale of most of mei s remaining energy assets and the current estimated costs of winding down mei s wastewater businesses 
during january  mei changed its name to northern water resources  inc nwr 
future outlook competition and restructuring the electric utility business is experiencing rapid and substantial changes 
these changes are the result of the following trends disparity in electric rates  transmission  and generating capacity among and within various regions of the country  improvements in generation efficiency  increasing demand for customer choice  and new regulations and legislation intended to foster competition  also known as restructuring 
electric utilities historically have had exclusive franchises for the retail sale of electricity in specified service territories 
as a result  competition for retail customers has been limited to competition with alternative fuel suppliers  primarily for heating and cooling  competition with customer owned generation  and direct competition among electric utilities to attract major new facilities to their service territories 
these competitive pressures have led the company and other utilities to offer  from time to time  special discounts or service packages to certain large customers 
in certain states across the country  including all the new england states except vermont  legislation has been enacted to allow retail customers to choose their electricity suppliers  with incumbent utilities required to deliver that electricity over their transmission and distribution systems also known as retail wheeling 
increased pressure in the electric utility industry may restrict the company s ability to charge energy prices sufficient to recover embedded costs  such as the cost of purchased power obligations or of generation facilities owned by the company 
the amount by which such costs might exceed market prices is commonly referred to as stranded costs 
regulatory and legislative authorities at the federal level and in some states  including vermont where legislation has not been enacted  are considering whether  when and how to facilitate competition for electricity sales at the wholesale and retail levels 
recent difficulties in some regulatory jurisdictions  such as california  have dampened any immediate push towards deregulation in vermont 
however  in the future  the vermont general assembly through legislation  or the vpsb through a subsequent report  action or proceeding  may allow customers to choose their electric supplier 
if this happens without providing for recovery of a significant portion of the costs associated with our power supply obligations and other costs of providing vertically integrated service  the company s franchise  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at the current level  would be adversely affected 
item a 
risk factors the major risk factors for the company arising from electric industry restructuring  including risks pertaining to the recovery of stranded costs  are regulatory and legal decisions  cost and amount of default service responsibility  the market price of power  and the amount of market share retained by the company 
there can be no assurance that any potential future restructuring plan ordered by the vpsb  the courts  or through legislation will include a mechanism that would allow for full recovery of our stranded costs and include a fair return on those costs as they are being recovered 
if laws are enacted or regulatory decisions are made that do not offer an adequate opportunity to recover stranded costs  we believe we have compelling legal arguments to challenge such laws or decisions 
the largest category of our potential stranded costs is future costs under long term power purchase contracts  which  based on current forecasts  are above market 
the magnitude of our stranded costs is largely dependent upon the future market price of power 
we have discussed various market price scenarios with interested parties for the purpose of identifying stranded costs 
preliminary market price assumptions  which are likely to change  have resulted in estimates of the company s stranded costs of between million and million 
we intend to aggressively pursue mitigation efforts in order to minimize the amount and maximize the recovery of these costs 
if retail competition is implemented in vermont  we cannot predict what the impact would be on the company s revenues from electricity sales 
historically  electric utility rates have been based on a utility s cost of service 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that apply only to regulated businesses 
statement of financial accounting standards number  sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company has established approximately million of net regulatory assets and liabilities under sfas the company currently complies with the provisions of sfas in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for following sfas  the accounting impact would be an extraordinary  non cash charge to operations of an amount that would be material 
factors that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include deregulation  a change in the regulator s approach to setting rates from cost based regulation to another form of regulation  increasing competition that limits our ability to sell utility services or products at rates that will recover costs  and regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
under statement of financial accounting standards number sfas  accounting for contingencies  the enactment of restructuring legislation or issuance of a regulatory order containing provisions that do not allow for the recovery of above market power costs would require the company to estimate and record losses immediately  on an undiscounted basis  for any above market power purchase contracts and other costs which are probable of not being recoverable from customers  to the extent that those costs are estimable 
we are unable to predict what form future legislation  if passed  or an order if issued  will take  and we cannot predict if or to what extent sfas will continue to be applicable in the future 
in addition  members of the staff of the securities and exchange commission have raised questions concerning the continued applicability of sfas to certain other electric utilities facing restructuring 
we cannot predict whether restructuring legislation enacted by the vermont general assembly or any subsequent report or actions of  or proceedings before  the vpsb or the vermont general assembly would have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition or credit ratings 
the failure to recover a significant portion of our purchased power costs  or to retain and attract customers in a competitive environment  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating results  cash flows and ability to pay dividends at current levels 
inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in our commodity prices 
restructuring of the wholesale market for electricity has brought increased price volatility to our power supply markets 
the price of electricity is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in supply and demand 
to reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  we have established a policy to hedge through the utilization of derivatives our supply and related purchase and sales commitments  as well as our anticipated purchase and sales 
because the commodities covered by these derivatives are substantially the same commodities that the company buys and sells in the physical market  no special correlation studies other than monitoring the degree of convergence between the derivative and cash markets  are deemed necessary 
changes in market value of derivatives have a high correlation to the price changes of the hedged commodities 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the exposure to the market price risk of our electricity commodity positions 
our daily net commodity position consists of purchased electric capacity 
the table below presents market risk estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in prices 
actual results may differ materially from the table 
commodity price risk at december  fair value market risk in thousands highest long position 
  highest short position   average short position   risk factors associated with the discontinuation of mei operations include the outcome of warranty litigation  and future cash requirements necessary to minimize costs of winding down wastewater operations 
several municipalities using wastewater treatment equipment provided by micronair  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of mei  have commenced or threatened litigation against micronair 
the ultimate loss remains subject to the disposition of remaining mei assets and liabilities  and could exceed the amounts recorded 
unregulated businesses in  we significantly reduced our investment in unregulated businesses  continuing the process we began in june  when we decided to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of mei  and report its results as loss from operations of a discontinued segment 
mei  which invested in energy generation  energy efficiency and waste water treatment projects  lost million in  compared with a loss of million in the loss results primarily from provisions to recognize present and estimated future losses from the sale of mei s remaining businesses  including anticipated operating losses 
green mountain resources  inc gmri was formed in april to explore opportunities in the emerging competitive retail energy market 
in  gmri earned  compared with earnings of  in gmri s earnings in were primarily due to the sale of its remaining interest in green mountain energy resources ending operations for this subsidiary

total operating revenues increased million or percent in for the same reason 
total retail revenues increased million or percent in primarily due to a percent retail rate increase for service rendered on or after december   a percent increase in sales of electricity to our commercial and industrial customers resulting from customer growth and increased use of air conditioning during the spring and summer months  and a percent increase in sales of electricity to residential customers  a result of customer growth and a warmer than normal summer 
international business machines ibm  the company s single largest customer  operates manufacturing facilities in essex junction  vermont 
ibm s electricity requirements for its main plant and an adjacent plant accounted for   and percent of the company s total operating revenues in   and  respectively  and  and percent of the company s retail operating revenues in   and  respectively 
no other retail customer accounted for more than one percent of the company s revenue in any year 
since  the company has had agreements with ibm with respect to electricity sales above agreed upon base load levels 
on december   the vpsb approved a new three year agreement between the company and ibm  ending december  the price of power for the renewal period of the agreement is above our marginal costs of providing incremental service to ibm 
power supply expenses our inability to recover our power supply costs has been the primary reason for the poor performance of the company s common stock over the past three years 
the settlement order removes this obstacle by allowing the company rate recovery of its estimated power supply costs for furthermore  the settlement order allows the company to use approximately million in rate levelization cash flow to achieve its allowed rate of return in and  and  together with the extension of our power supply agreement with ms  provides us an opportunity to recover our power supply costs in without further rate relief see power supply commitments  retail rate cases and risk factors in this section 
power supply expenses constituted   and percent of total operating expenses for the years   and  respectively 
power supply expenses increased by million or percent in and million or percent in the increase in power supply expenses from to resulted from the following a million increase from power purchased for resale  primarily under a power supply agreement discussed below  whereby we buy power from ms that is sufficient to serve pre established load requirements at a pre defined price  a million increase in energy costs arising from a power supply arrangement with hydro quebec  discussed below  whereby hydro quebec has an option to purchase energy at prices that were below market replacement costs  the costs to serve increased retail sales of electricity of percent in and higher unit power supply costs  and a million increase in capacity costs associated with our long term hydro quebec power supply contract 
these amounts were partially offset by a reduction in of million in losses accrued for the hydro quebec power cost disallowance under past regulatory rulings 
results for reflected pretax charges of million in disallowed hydro quebec power costs  compared with the amortization during of accrued power expense of million for that had been recorded in the power supply costs of company owned generation increased percent or million in due to purchases by ms under a power supply agreement discussed below and because units were dispatched for system reliability requirements due to the unavailability of certain transmission facilities 
power supply expenses increased by million or percent from to the increase in power supply expenses from to resulted from the following a million increase reflecting the power purchase and supply agreement discussed below  whereby we buy power from ms that is sufficient to serve pre established load requirements at a pre defined price  a million increase in the capacity costs in associated with our long term hydro quebec power supply contract  an increase in the costs of short term power following the deregulation of wholesale energy markets in new england  as well as an increase in our costs to serve increased local loads and to supply power to meet contractual obligations under the company s december sell back arrangement with hydro quebec net cost approximately million  and a million increase in vermont yankee capacity costs 
these amounts were partially offset by a reduction of million in losses accrued for the hydro quebec power cost disallowance 
results for reflected pretax charges of million in disallowed hydro quebec power costs for both and  compared with disallowed power costs of million for recorded in the power supply costs of company owned generation decreased percent in due to the severe ice storm in new england that caused increased usage in that year of peak generation resources to replace power that was unavailable from hydro quebec 
an independent system operator in new england iso replaced the new england power pool nepool effective may  the iso works as a clearinghouse for purchasers and sellers of electricity in the new deregulated wholesale markets 
sellers place bids for the sale of their generation or purchased power resources and if demand is high enough the output from those resources is sold 
we must purchase electricity to meet customer demand during periods of high usage and to replace energy repurchased by hydro quebec under an arrangement negotiated in our costs to serve demand during periods of warmer than normal temperatures in summer months and to replace such energy repurchases by hydro quebec rose substantially after the wholesale power markets became deregulated  which caused much greater volatility in spot prices for electricity 
the cost of securing future power supplies has also risen substantially in tandem with higher summer power supply costs 
the company cannot predict the duration or the extent to which future prices will continue to trade above historical levels of cost 
if the new markets continue to experience the volatility evident during and  our earnings and cash flow could be adversely impacted by a material amount 
power contract commitments on february   we entered into a contract with ms as a result of our power requirements solicitation in a master power purchase and sales agreement ppsa defines the general contract terms under which the parties may transact 
the sales under the ppsa commenced on february  and will terminate after all obligations under each transaction entered into by ms and the company has been fulfilled 
the ppsa has been noticed to the vpsb and filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
in january  the ppsa was modified and extended to december  the ppsa provides us with a means of managing price risks associated with changing fossil fuel prices 
on a daily basis  and at ms s discretion  we sell power to ms from either i all or part of our portfolio of power resources at predefined operating and pricing parameters or ii any power resources available to us  provided that sales of power from sources other than company owned generation comply with the predefined operating and pricing parameters 
ms then sells to us  at a predefined price  power sufficient to serve pre established load requirements 
ms is also responsible for scheduling supply resources 
we remain responsible for resource performance and availability 
ms provides no coverage against major unscheduled outages 
the company and ms have agreed to the protocols that are used to schedule power sales and purchases and to secure necessary transmission 
we estimate that the company saved approximately million during over what our energy costs would have been absent the ppsa due to our avoiding significant increases in fossil fuel prices 
during  we negotiated an arrangement with hydro quebec that reduced the cost under our contract with hydro quebec over the november through october period the july agreement 
as part of the july agreement  we were obligated to purchase million in dollars worth of research and development work from hydro quebec over a four year period which has since been extended to  and made a million in dollars payment to hydro quebec in hydro quebec retains the right to curtail annual energy deliveries by percent up to five times  over the to period  if documented drought conditions exist in qu bec 
during the first year of the july agreement the period from november through october  the average cost per kilowatt hour of schedules b and c combined was cut from to cents per kilowatt hour  a percent or million cost reduction 
over the period from november through december and accounting for the payments to hydro quebec  the combined unit costs will be lowered from to cents per kilowatt hour  reducing unit costs by percent and saving million in nominal terms 
under a power supply arrangement executed in january  we received payments from hydro quebec of million in and million in under we are required to shift up to megawatts of deliveries to an alternate transmission path  and use the associated portion of the nepool hydro quebec interconnection facilities to purchase power for the period from september through june at prices that vary based upon conditions in effect when the purchases are made 
also provides for minimum payments by the company to hydro quebec for periods in which power is not purchased under the arrangement 
allows hydro quebec to curtail deliveries of energy should it need to use certain resources to supplement available supply 
hydro quebec did curtail deliveries in the fourth quarter of although our level of future benefits will depend on various factors  including market prices and availability of energy from hq  we estimate that has provided a benefit of approximately million on a net present value basis through december  under a separate arrangement executed on december   hydro quebec paid million to the company in in return for this payment  we provided hydro quebec options for the purchase of power 
commencing april  and effective through the term of the contract  which ends in  hydro quebec may purchase up to  mwh option a on an annual basis  at the contract energy prices  which are substantially below current market prices 
the cumulative amount of energy that may be purchased under option a shall not exceed  mwh over the same period  hydro quebec may exercise an option to purchase a total of  mwh option b at the contract energy price 
under option b  hydro quebec may purchase no more than  mwh in any year 
as of december   hydro quebec had purchased or called to purchase  mwh under option b  including calls for january and february of in  hydro quebec exercised option a and option b  calling for deliveries to third parties at a net cost to the company of approximately million including the cost of january and february  calls  and the cost of related financial positions  which was due to higher energy replacement costs incurred by the company 
approximately million of the million net costs were recovered in rates on an annual basis 
in  hydro quebec called for deliveries to third parties at a net cost of approximately million 
hydro quebec s option to curtail energy deliveries pursuant to the july agreement can be exercised in addition to these purchase options 
the vpsb  in the settlement order said  the record does not demonstrate that any other new england utility foresaw the extent and degree of volatility that has developed in the new england wholesale power markets 
absent that volatility  the agreement would not have had adverse effects 
in conjunction with the settlement order  hydro quebec committed to the department  that it would not call any energy under option b of during in  the company and the other vermont joint owners who are parties to the hydro quebec contract initiated an arbitration against hydro quebec  pursuant to the contract terms  to determine whether hydro quebec s suspension of deliveries of power to vermont during and after the january ice storm evidenced a default by hydro quebec under the terms of that contract 
hydro quebec maintains that the force majeure superior or irreversible force provision in the contract applies  which could excuse its non delivery of power under these circumstances 
arbitration of the dispute may lead to remedies having a material impact on our contractual obligation  including the possibility that the contract be declared terminated or void 
if arbitration results in a cash payment  it will first be applied to a regulatory asset of million for arbitration litigation costs 
the settlement order provides that the company will not earn a return on these litigation costs  unless the case results in lower power supply costs for ratepayers 
hearings have concluded and a decision is expected in april if the contract is declared terminated or void  the company would have to replace a substantial amount of its power needs at terms which could materially exceed the contract price for the company believes that it could contract replacement power at costs below the long term costs of the contract 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million in the increase is primarily due to a million charge for disallowed regulatory litigation costs  ordered by the vpsb as part of the settlement order 
the increase was offset by a million decrease in administrative and general expense caused by the company s reorganization efforts that reduced the size of the workforce and lowered building occupancy costs 
other operating expenses decreased million or percent in the decrease resulted from a million estimated loss in to recognize the cost of terminating the company s corporate headquarters operating lease 
the facilities were sold in april  a million reduction in administrative and general salaries related to a workforce reduction plan  the elimination in of a regulatory liability of million relating to the company s former corporate headquarters  and reductions in lease expense and facility carrying costs resulting from the disposal of the former headquarters 
these savings were partially offset by increased costs of approximately million associated with the company s reorganization 
transmission expenses transmission expenses increased million or percent in primarily due to congestion charges that reflect the lack of adequate transmission or generation capacity in certain locations within new england 
these charges are allocated to all iso new england members 
the company is unable to predict the magnitude or duration of future congestion charge allocation  but amounts could be material 
transmission expenses increased million or percent in due to costs associated with the creation of the iso as the clearing house for power trades in new england and due to refunds in from central vermont public service corp 
and new england power company 
a ferc ruling in december required iso new england to revise its installed capability icap deficiency charge of per kw month to per kw month retroactive to august  on january   ferc stayed its order to ensure that bills for past periods will not be assessed until the commission has considered the pending requests for rehearing  which  if successful  would then require extensive refunds and surcharges 
on march   ferc issued an order on rehearing in which it partly reversed itself on the icap charge 
although the commission first concluded that a charge is reasonable and that the charge would remain in place until the iso supports an acceptable superseding proposal  the commission then concluded that reinstating the would have a large cost impact 
as a result  the per kw month charge was reinstated from august  until april  the commission allowed the charge to become effective on april  until the effective date of any superseding charge the commission might accept 
on march   an iso new england participant filed a request for re hearing the ferc s march  order on rehearing 
the request asks for a reversal of the lowered icap charge for the period from august  until april  if the lowered icap charge is increased to per kw month  then the company would be required to pay iso new england approximately million 
management cannot determine the ultimate impact of the request at this time 
in  ferc issued a separate order order requiring all utilities to file plans for the formation and administration of regional transmission organizations rto 
in january  the company and other vermont transmission owning companies filed in compliance with order the vermont companies support the petition for declaratory order by various new england transmission owning companies  with reservations 
the vermont companies principal concerns relate to whether a new england rto nerto will include all non pool transmission facilities in the nerto tariff on a rolled in basis  whether highgate and phase i phase ii transmission facilities will be included in the tariff without a separate transmission levy  whether nerto will continue the transition to a single regional transmission rate  and the percentage of equity that transmission owners may acquire in the new organization 
the company is unable to estimate how these issues will be resolved  but the impact could be material 
maintenance expenses maintenance expenses decreased million or percent in due to changes in scheduled maintenance 
maintenance expenses increased million or percent in  reflecting increased expenditures on right of way maintenance programs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million or percent in due to reductions in amortization of demand side management costs that were only partially offset by increased depreciation of utility plant in service

environmental matters the electric industry typically uses or generates a range of potentially hazardous products in its operations 
we must meet various land  water  air and aesthetic requirements as administered by local  state and federal regulatory agencies 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these requirements  and that there are no outstanding material complaints about our compliance with present environmental protection regulations  except for developments related to the pine street barge canal site 
pine street barge canal site the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  commonly known as the superfund law  generally imposes strict  joint and several liability  regardless of fault  for remediation of property contaminated with hazardous substances 
we have previously been notified by the environmental protection agency epa that we are one of several potentially responsible parties prps for cleanup of the pine street barge canal site in burlington  vermont  where coal tar and other industrial materials were deposited 
in september  we negotiated a final settlement with the united states  the state of vermont the state  and other parties to a consent decree that covers claims with respect to the site and implementation of the selected site cleanup remedy 
in november  the consent decree was filed in the federal district court 
the consent decree addresses claims by the epa for past pine street barge canal site costs  natural resource damage claims and claims for past and future oversight costs 
the consent decree also provides for the design and implementation of response actions at the site 
as of december   our total expenditures related to the pine street barge canal site since were approximately million 
this includes amounts not recovered in rates  amounts recovered in rates  and amounts for which rate recovery has been sought but which are presently awaiting further vpsb action 
the bulk of these expenditures consisted of transaction costs 
transaction costs include legal and consulting costs associated with the company s opposition to the epa s earlier proposals for a more expensive remedy at the site  litigation and related costs necessary to obtain settlements with insurers and other prps to provide amounts required to fund the clean up remediation costs  and to address liability claims at the site 
a smaller amount of past expenditures was for site related response costs  including costs incurred pursuant to epa and state orders that resulted in funding response activities at the site  and to reimbursing the epa and the state for oversight and related response costs 
the epa and the state have asserted and affirmed that all costs related to these orders are appropriate costs of response under cercla for which the company and other prps were legally responsible 
we estimate that we have recovered or secured  or will recover  through settlements of litigation claims against insurers and other parties  amounts that exceed estimated future remediation costs  future federal and state government oversight costs and past epa response costs 
we currently estimate our unrecovered transaction costs mentioned above  which were necessary to recover settlements sufficient to remediate the site  to oppose much more costly solutions proposed by the epa  and to resolve monetary claims of the epa and the state  together with our remediation costs  to be million over the next years 
the estimated liability is not discounted  and it is possible that our estimate of future costs could change by a material amount 
we also have recorded an offsetting regulatory asset and we believe that it is probable that we will receive future revenues to recover these costs 
through rate cases filed in    and  we sought and received recovery for ongoing expenses associated with the pine street barge canal site 
while reserving the right to argue in the future about the appropriateness of full rate recovery of the site related costs  the company and the department  and as applicable  other parties  reached agreements in these cases that the full amount of the site related costs reflected in those rate cases should be recovered in rates 
we proposed in our rate filing made on june  recovery of an additional million in such expenditures 
in an order in that case released march   the vpsb suspended the amortization of expenditures associated with the pine street barge canal site pending further proceedings 
although it did not eliminate the rate base deferral of these expenditures  or make any specific order in this regard  the vpsb indicated that it was inclined to agree with other parties in the case that the ultimate costs associated with the pine street barge canal site  taking into account recoveries from insurance carriers and other prps  should be shared between customers and shareholders of the company 
in response to our motion for reconsideration  the vpsb on june  stated its intent was to reserve for a future docket issues pertaining to the sharing of remediation related costs between the company and its customers 
the settlement order released january  did not change the status of pine street cost recovery 
clean air act because we purchase most of our power supply from other utilities  we do not anticipate that we will incur any material direct cost increases as a result of the federal clean air act or proposals to make more stringent regulations under that act 
furthermore  only one of our power supply purchase contracts  which expired in early  related to a generating plant that was affected by phase i of the acid rain provisions of this legislation  which went into effect january  rates retail rate cases on march   the vpsb released its order dated february  in the then pending rate case the rate case 
the vpsb authorized us to increase our rates by percent  which gave us increased annual revenues of million 
the vpsb order denied us the right to charge customers million of the annual costs for power purchased under our contract with hydro quebec 
the vpsb denied recovery of these costs for the following reasons the vpsb claimed that we had acted imprudently by committing to the power contract with hydro quebec in august the imprudence disallowance  and to the extent that the costs of power to be purchased from hydro quebec were higher than current estimates of market prices for power during the contract term  after accounting for the imprudence disallowance  the contract power was decreed not used and useful 
we appealed the vpsb s ruling in the rate case to the vermont supreme court 
on may   we filed a request with the vpsb to increase our retail rates by percent due to higher power costs  the cost of the january ice storm  and investments in new plant and equipment the rate case 
on november   by memorandum of understanding mou  the company  the department and ibm agreed to stay rate proceedings in the rate case until or after september   or such earlier date as the parties may later agree to or the vpsb may order 
the agreement to suspend our rate case delayed the date of a final decision on the rate case to december   and we recognized an additional loss of million in the last quarter of representing the effect of the continued disallowance of hydro quebec costs through december  the mou provided for a percent temporary rate increase  to produce million in annualized additional revenue  effective with service rendered december  an additional surcharge was permitted  without further vpsb order  in order to produce additional revenues necessary to provide the company with the capacity to finance pine street barge canal site expenditures 
the mou was approved by the vpsb on december  the mou did not provide for any specific disallowance of power costs under our purchase power contract with hydro quebec 
issues respecting recovery of such power costs were preserved for future proceedings 
the stay and suspension of the rate case and the temporary rate levels agreed to in the mou were designed to allow us to continue to provide adequate and efficient service to our customers while we sought mitigation of power supply costs 
on september and december   the vpsb issued orders approving two amendments to the mou that the company had entered into with the department and ibm 
the two amendments continued the stay of proceedings until september   with a final decision expected by december  the amendments maintained the other features of the original mou  and the second amendment provided for a temporary rate increase of percent  in addition to the previous temporary rate level  to become effective as of january  the company reached a final settlement agreement with the department in the rate case during november the final settlement agreement contains the following provisions a rate increase of percent above existing rates  beginning with bills rendered january   and prior temporary rate increases became permanent  rates set at levels that recover the company s hydro quebec vjo contract costs  effectively ending the regulatory disallowances experienced by the company over the past three years  the company agrees not to seek any further increase in electric rates prior to april effective in bills rendered january unless certain substantially adverse conditions arise  including a provision allowing a request for additional rate relief if power supply costs increase in excess of million over forecasted levels  the company agreed to write off approximately million in unrecovered rate case litigation costs  and to freeze its dividend rate until it successfully replaces short term credit facilities with long term debt or equity financing  seasonal rates will be eliminated in april  which is expected to generate approximately million in additional cash flow in that can be utilized to offset increased costs during  and  the company agrees to consult extensively with the department regarding capital spending commitments for upgrading our electric distribution system and to adopt customer care and reliability performance standards  in a first step toward possible development of performance based rate making  and the company agrees to withdraw its vermont supreme court appeal of the vpsb s order in the rate case 
on january   the vpsb approved the company s settlement with the department  with two additional conditions the vpsb order requires the company and customers to share equally any premium above book value realized by the company in any future merger  acquisition or asset sale  subject to an million limit on the customers share  and the second condition restricts company investments in non utility operations 
liquidity and capital resources construction our capital requirements result from the need to construct facilities or to invest in programs to meet anticipated customer demand for electric service 
capital expenditures over the past three years and forecasted for are as follows generation transmission distribution conservation other total in thousands actual forecast other includes million in  million in  and million in for the pine street barge canal site 
a state wide energy efficiency utility set up by the vpsb in manages all energy efficiency programs  receiving funds the company bills to its customers as a separate charge 
dividend policy the annual dividend rate was per share at december  the settlement order limits the dividend rate at its current level until short term credit facilities are replaced with long term debt or equity financing 
retained earnings at december  were approximately million 
the company anticipates substantial improvement in retained earnings during  beginning with the first quarter  and believes it will be able to maintain the current dividend rate 
if retained earnings were eliminated  the company would not be able to declare a dividend under its restated articles of association 
financing and capitalization internally generated funds provided approximately percent of requirements for  and combined 
internally generated funds  after payment of dividends  provide capital requirements for construction  sinking funds and other requirements 
we anticipate that for  internally generated funds will provide approximately percent of total capital requirements for regulated operations 
at december   our capitalization consisted of percent common equity  percent long term debt and percent preferred equity 
on june   we renewed a million revolving credit agreement with fleet national bank and citizens bank of massachusetts the fleet agreement 
the fleet agreement is for a period of days and will expire on june  at december   there was million outstanding on the fleet agreement 
the fleet agreement is secured by granting the banks a second priority mortgage  lien and security interest in the collateral pledged under the company s first mortgage bond indenture 
on september   we established a million revolving credit agreement with keybank national association keybank 
the agreement will expire on september  pursuant to a one year power supply option agreement between the company and energy east corporation ee  ee made a payment of million to the company 
in exchange  the company gave ee an option to purchase energy from certain wholly owned production facilities  for a period not to exceed years  if the funds are not returned to ee upon request after september the company was required to invest the funds provided by ee in a certificate of deposit at keybank pledged by the company to secure the repayment of the keybank revolving credit facility 
at december   there was million outstanding on the keybank line of credit 
the company anticipates that it will secure financing that replaces some or all of its expiring facilities during the settlement order will likely permit restoration of the company s investment grade debt rating  allowing arrangement of such financing as the company needs during the credit ratings of the company s securities are fitch moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds

nuclear decommissioning the staff of the sec has questioned certain current accounting practices of the electric utility industry regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating units in financial statements 
in response to these questions  the financial accounting standards board had agreed to review the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning 
we do not believe that changes in such accounting  if required  would have an adverse effect on the results of operations due to our current and future ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
effects of inflation financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic costs 
this accounting provides reasonable financial statements but does not always take inflation into consideration 
as rate recovery is based on these historical costs and known and measurable changes  the company is able to receive some rate relief for inflation 
it does not receive immediate rate recovery relating to fixed costs associated with company assets 
such fixed costs are recovered based on historic figures 
any effects of inflation on plant costs are generally offset by the fact that these assets are financed through long term debt
