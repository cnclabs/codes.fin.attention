general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains and losses on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
potential impact of accounting principles to be implemented in the future the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities  in the first quarter of the year ending december  the principal effects of adoption of sfas and sfas relate to reclassification as available for sale of certain debt securities previously classified as held to maturity and recognition of outstanding interest rate swaps as hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market rates of interest 
these changes will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   the ratio of great southern s one year gap to total assets was a negative and its ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee as necessary recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
in  the company began using interest rate swap derivatives to manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are utilized when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated asset or liability and such asset or liability exposes the company to interest rate risk

because of this fiscal year change  the results of operations for the year ended december  have been compared to the results of operations for the year ended june  comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   the company increased total assets by million to billion 
a large portion of the increase was due to the increase in net loans of million 
the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial real estate  commercial construction  consumer and one to four family residential 
total investment securities increased by million  which was primarily an increase in available for sale united states government agency securities 
additionally  investment in fhlbank stock increased million 
total liabilities increased million from december  to december   to billion 
fhlbank advances increased million 
short term borrowings decreased million  due to a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements with retail customers  primarily due to the loss of one customer 
generally  the interest rates paid on these repurchase accounts was lower than rates paid on fhlbank advances or brokered certificates of deposit in while these types of deposits are generally less expensive  there is limited availability of these funds in our market 
deposits increased million due primarily to an increase in certificates of deposit of million  of which million related to brokered deposits 
total brokered deposits were million at december  the weighted average cost of these deposits was approximately basis points higher than the rest of the certificate of deposit portfolio 
management continues to feel that fhlbank advances and brokered deposits are viable alternatives to retail deposits when factoring in all the costs associated with the generation and maintenance of additional retail deposits 
checking accounts increased million  with an increase of million in non interest bearing accounts and an increase of million in interest bearing accounts 
the increase in certificates of deposit and checking accounts was partially offset by the decrease in savings accounts of million 
a good portion of this million decrease was actually moved into other bank products  primarily checking accounts  with the remainder leaving the bank 
stockholders equity increased million from december  to december   to million 
net income for fiscal year was million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased by million 
these items were offset by dividends of million and net treasury stock repurchases of million 
the company repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share during results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general the increase in earnings of million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million  or  and an increase in non interest income of  or  partially offset by an increase in non interest expense of  or  an increase in provision for loan losses of million  or  and an increase in provision for income taxes of million  or 
total interest income total interest income increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a million  or  increase in interest income on loans and a million  or  increase in interest income on investments and other interest earning assets 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans increased from both higher average balances and higher average rates of interest 
interest income increased million as the result of an increase in average loan balances from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial real estate and construction lending and indirect consumer lending 
interest income also increased million as the result of higher average interest rates 
the average yield on loans increased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   as a result of the increases in the aforementioned loan types which generally bear higher rates than other loan types and due to higher market rates of interest 
a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
interest income investments and other interest earning assets interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased mainly as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale securities  where additional securities were acquired for liquidity and pledging to deposit accounts under repurchase agreements 
interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average yields from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  total interest expense total interest expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  an increase in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or  and an increase in interest expense on short term borrowings of million  or 
interest expense deposits interest expense on deposits increased million as a result of an increase in average balances of time deposits from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average interest rates on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average balances of time deposits increased primarily as a result of the company s use of brokered and other time deposits to fund loan growth 
in recent years  brokered deposit rates have become competitive with rates on fhlbank advances and larger retail deposits 
the average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates of interest 
interest on demand deposits decreased  due to a decrease in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   and increased  due to an increase in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the other deposit category  savings  experienced a  decrease due to both lower balances and lower market interest rates 
interest expense fhlbank and other borrowings interest expense on fhlbank advances and short term borrowings increased million due to an increase in average balances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  average rates increased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   resulting in increased interest expense of million due to higher rates 
the average balance increase was used to fund growth in loans and securities 
average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates during net interest income the company s overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to an basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december   compared to an average of during the year ended december  as a large percentage of the bank s loans are tied to prime  this increase was the primary reason for the increase in the weighted average yield received on interest earning assets 
interest rates paid on deposits and fhlbank advances increased during compared to as the company has grown the assets of the bank  the brokered and other time deposits and advances needed to fund that growth have increased the average cost of deposits since time deposits are higher cost deposits for the bank than are interest bearing demand and savings 
in addition  overall interest rates were higher during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased million  or  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
non performing assets increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  non performing loans increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december   and foreclosed assets increased million  or  from  at december   to million at december  commercial loans comprise million  or  of the total million non performing loans at december  two large commercial real estate credit relationships  totaling million and million  respectively  account for a majority of this non performing total 
the million relationship is secured primarily by condominium buildings and lots  single family residences and lots  and other developed land near the lake of the ozarks  missouri 
this relationship was placed in a non accrual status in the fourth quarter of bank management is working with the borrower and another bank to explore possible modifications to the loan terms and to secure additional collateral for the loans 
the million relationship is secured by a golf course and undeveloped lots near the lake of the ozarks  missouri 
this relationship was placed on non accrual status in the fourth quarter of subsequent to december   the bank has commenced foreclosure on the collateral 
bank management is communicating frequently with these borrowers to determine the status of the projects and to develop action plans for these loans 
of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   three relationships account for million 
the first relationship involves a theater in branson  missouri 
the theater was leased through december   and is now vacant and is listed for sale with a broker 
the second relationship involves two retail commercial buildings in springfield  missouri 
the buildings are vacant and are listed for sale with a broker 
the third relationship involves a single family residence located near joplin  missouri 
the house was under construction at the time of foreclosure and is now near completion 
potential problem loans decreased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  these are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems which may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current loan repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in the non performing loans 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing and  accordingly  additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non interest income non interest income increased  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase in service charges and atm fees of million  or  and ii an increase in income on foreclosed assets of  the increase in service charges fees resulted from increased rates and a larger number of deposit accounts 
the increase in atm fees is related to an increased number of atms in the company s market area along with a nominal increase in transaction charges  resulting in increased fees from use by non customers 
the increased income on foreclosed assets in is primarily the result of recognizing a deferred gain of  upon partial repayment of a loan made in connection with the sale of other real estate 
this increase was partially offset by i a decrease in net realized gains on sales of fixed rate residential and other loans of  or  ii a decrease of  or  in profits on sales of available for sale securities  and iii a decrease of  or  in late charges  prepayment penalties  and other loan fees 
during the year ended december   the bank recognized less gains on the sale of residential and student loans than in during  interest rates were conducive to the generation of fixed rate mortgages  which the bank typically sells  rather than adjustable rate mortgages  which the bank typically retains in its portfolio 
during the year ended december   the company sold some of its investments in equity securities and realized the gains 
non interest expense non interest expense increased  or  in the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase of  or  in net occupancy and equipment expense due primarily to renovation work at the company s main office and operations center  ii an increase of  or  in postage expense  iii an increase of  or  in marketing and advertising expense due primarily to the company s introduction of its new online banking product and other new products  and iv an increase of  or  in professional fees primarily due to fees paid to consultants who assisted in the implementation of new products during the fourth quarter of these payments to the consultants will cease after february this was partially offset by i a decrease of  or  in salaries and employee benefits  ii a decrease of  or  in office supplies and printing expense  and iii a decrease of  or  in insurance expense due to lower fdic premiums 
the higher amounts of expenses in for office supplies and printing were related to the company s core computer conversion  year issues and other technology related items 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income increased slightly from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  average balances  interest rates and yields the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin
