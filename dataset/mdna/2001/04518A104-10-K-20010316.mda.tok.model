item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading china based company providing world class software products and network solutions 
our software products and network solutions enable our customers to build  maintain  operate and continuously improve their internet and communications infrastructure 
we commenced our operations in texas in and moved our operations from texas to china in we began generating significant network solutions revenues in and significant software license revenues in while we source hardware for our customers through our us parent company  asiainfo holdings  inc  we conduct the bulk of our business through our wholly owned operating subsidiary  asiainfo technologies china inc  which is a chinese company 
sales to china telecom and its provincial subsidiaries accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
our customer base is continuing to diversify and  at december   approximately of our backlog net of hardware costs was attributable to china telecom  while was attributable to china unicom  was attributable to china netcom and was attributable to china mobile 
we expect our business to continue to evolve as the internet and telecommunications markets in china change and expand 
recently  sales of software products have been an increasingly significant contributor to our business  accounting for of revenues net of hardware costs in we expect this trend to continue and intend to establish arrangements with foreign companies to distribute our software products outside of china 
we believe that there are opportunities for us to expand into new business areas 
by the end of the first quarter of  we expect to have invested a total of million in our majority owned network security business  marsec  which focuses on high end security services for our customers 
marsec generated sales orders of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  and we anticipate that it will generate sales orders of approximately million in other new areas include our application infrastructure provider aip business  in which we invested million in in view of these recent and potential future changes to our business  our historical financial data may not be a meaningful basis upon which to evaluate us and our prospects 
revenues our total revenues have grown from million in to million in and in we generate our revenues from our two principal business lines network solutions and software products 
although we account for our network solutions revenues on a gross basis  inclusive of hardware acquisition costs that are passed through to our customers  we manage our business internally based on revenues net of hardware costs  which is consistent with our strategy to focus increasingly on providing our customers with high value it professional services while gradually outsourcing lower end services such as hardware acquisition and installation 
this strategy may result in lower growth rates for total revenues as against prior periods  but will not adversely impact revenues net of hardware costs 
the following table shows our revenue breakdown by business line on this basis year ended december  business line network solutions net of hardware costs software license total revenues net of hardware costs as demonstrated by the foregoing table  software products have accounted for an increasing portion of our total revenues net of hardware costs over the past several years  increasing from in to in and in we expect that software products will account for a growing portion of our future net revenues 
backlog 
most of our revenues are derived from customers orders under separate binding contracts for hardware  network solutions and software products 
these contracts constitute our backlog at any given time 
revenues for hardware  network solutions and software products are recognized during the course of the relevant project  as described in more detail below 
at december   our backlog net of hardware costs was million  approximately of which related to network solutions and of which related to software orders 
network solutions revenues 
network solutions revenues consist of hardware sales for equipment procured by us on behalf of our customers from hardware vendors  as well as services for planning  design  systems integration  training and customization of our proprietary and third party software 
we procure for and sell hardware to our customers as part of our total solutions strategy 
we minimize our exposure to hardware risks by sourcing equipment from hardware vendors against back to back orders and letters of credit from our customers 
we believe that as the internet related market in china develops  our customers will increasingly purchase hardware directly from hardware vendors and pay us separately for the full value of our professional services 
we generally charge a fixed price for our network solutions projects and recognize revenue based on the percentage of completion of the project 
labor hours are used to determine the stage of completion except for revenues associated with the procurement of hardware on behalf of the customer 
such hardware related revenues are recognized upon delivery 
since a large part of the cost of a network solutions project often relates to hardware  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
however  this does not significantly affect our gross margin as hardware revenues generally approximate the related costs 
our quarterly results are also subject to fluctuations because a significant part of our network solutions revenues are derived from a limited number of large contracts 
there are three key milestones in the life of a network solutions project 
the first milestone occurs when the hardware is delivered  which is usually between three and four months after signing the contract 
the second milestone in a network solutions project is at primary acceptance  which usually occurs around five months after hardware delivery 
the third milestone is project acceptance  which occurs when the customer agrees that we have satisfactorily completed all our work for the project 
software license revenues 
software license revenues consist of fees received from customers for licenses to use our software products in perpetuity  up to a specified maximum number of users 
the customer must purchase additional user licenses from us when the number of users exceeds the specified maximum 
beginning with the year  our software license revenues also include the benefit of value added tax rebates on software license sales  which are part of the chinese government s policy of encouraging china s software industry 
substantially all our software license revenues are derived from our customer management and billing  and messaging software products 
we recognize substantially all software license revenues in conjunction with the revenues of the related solutions project over the installation and customization period based on the percentage of completion of the project as measured by labor hours 
the foregoing revenue recognition policies result in our recognizing certain revenues even though we are not due to receive the corresponding cash payment under the contract 
in the case of hardware sales  the customer typically holds back around of the hardware contract amount at the time of delivery 
in the case of services  while there may be some down payment  most of the revenues becomes billable at the time of primary acceptance 
the unpaid amounts for hardware and services become payable at the time of final project acceptance  when payment of all unpaid contract amounts is due 
when we recognize revenues for which payments are not yet due  we book unbilled accounts receivable until the corresponding amounts become payable 
cost of revenues network solutions costs 
network solutions costs consist primarily of third party hardware costs  compensation and travel expenses for the professionals involved in designing and implementing projects  and hardware warranty costs 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in certain recent large projects  we obtained less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we recognize compensation and travel costs for project professionals as incurred 
we accrue hardware warranty costs when hardware revenue is recognized upon final acceptance 
we obtain manufacturers warranties for hardware we sell  which cover a portion of the warranties that we give to our customers 
we currently accrue of hardware sales to cover potential warranty expenses 
this estimate of warranty cost is based on our current experience with contracts for which the warranty period has expired 
see factors affecting our operating results and our common stock we extend warranties to our network solutions customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
software license costs 
software license costs consist primarily of packaging and written manual expenses 
software license costs are negligible  since most of the costs associated with creating and enhancing software are classified as research and development expenses as incurred 
operating expenses operating expenses are comprised of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  and amortization expenses for goodwill and deferred stock compensation 
operating expenses consist for the most part of compensation expenses  which have risen as we have expanded and hired new personnel 
in  we undertook a comprehensive review of human resource policies  including salaries paid by leading multinational it companies operating in china 
this review resulted in a special increase in salaries for most of our employees to bring their compensation to market levels 
although we review salaries on an annual basis in order to ensure that we remain competitive with the market  we do not foresee the need to make material increases in the near term 
however  we may be required to do so from time to time in the future 
research and development expenses relate almost entirely to the development of new software and the enhancement and upgrading of existing software 
we expense these costs as they are incurred 
as we expand our software business  we expect these expenses to continue to increase 
we provide most of our officers and employees  and some of our directors  with stock options 
in the past  we granted a number of options with exercise prices below the fair market value of the related shares at the time of grant  most of which were issued prior to we do not  however  intend to issue options below fair market value in the future 
therefore  our deferred compensation expenses have been significantly higher historically than we expect them to be in future years 
the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the related shares is amortized over the vesting period of the options and reflected on our income statement as amortization of deferred stock compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we make bad debt provisions for accounts receivable balances based on management s assessment of the recoverability of revenues on a project by project basis 
because of the generally high credit worthiness of the leading chinese telecommunications service providers  who are our major customers  we do not believe that we are exposed to significant bad debt risk 
generally  a majority of our accounts receivable are paid within days of billing 
taxes except for hardware procurement and resale  we conduct substantially all of our business through our chinese operating subsidiaries 
our chinese subsidiaries are generally subject to a state corporate income tax and a local income tax 
asiainfo technologies  our principal operating subsidiary  is classified as a high technology company and  as such  is entitled to preferential treatment under chinese tax law 
asiainfo technologies operated free of chinese state corporate income tax for three years  beginning with its first year of operation  and was entitled to a tax reduction for the subsequent three years 
the tax holiday for asiainfo technologies expired on december  and the tax reduction expired on december  however  asiainfo technologies recently received a continuation of its preferential tax treatment from the local government for an additional three years  which will reduce its effective income tax rate to not less than 
in  we anticipate that the effective corporate income tax rate applicable to asiainfo technologies will be 
changes in chinese tax laws may adversely affect our future operations 
we are also subject to us income taxes on our procurement activities in the us at december   we had tax loss carry forwards for us income tax purposes of approximately  which will expire between and sales of hardware in china are subject to a value added tax 
most of our hardware sales are made through our us parent company and thus are not subject to the value added tax 
we effectively pass these taxes through to our customers and do not include them in revenues reported in our financial statements 
in respect of revenue on software license  if the net amount of value added tax payable exceeds of software sales  the excess portion of value added tax can be refunded immediately 
the company therefore enjoys an effective net value added tax burden of on software license revenues 
this policy is effective until foreign exchange substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service component of our network solutions business and software business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value of our shares will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollars and renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of renminbi could reduce the us dollar equivalent of the value of the earnings from  and our investment in  our subsidiaries in china 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in  from million in network solutions revenues accounted for million of this increase due in large part to the uninet project  which we commenced in on behalf of china unicom 
the uninet project contributed million in hardware costs  which was of our total hardware costs for the year 
revenues net of hardware costs increased approximately  from million in to million in software license revenues were million in  representing of revenues net of hardware costs and a increase over software license revenues of million in the growth in software license revenues reflected the overall growth of the internet related software market in china and our increased share of that market  which we believe is attributable to our investments in software related research and development and sales and marketing 
in addition  million of the increase in software license revenues was attributable to the value added tax rebates discussed above under the heading taxes 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the high hardware costs incurred in connection with the uninet project  as discussed above 
total hardware costs increased to million in  as compared to million in our cost of revenues net of hardware costs increased to million  as compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in our high end network solutions engineering personnel 
gross profits 
our gross profit increased  from million in to million in as a partial result of high hardware costs related to the uninet project  gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in  as compared to in however  gross profit as a percentage of revenues net of hardware costs remained relatively constant for at  as compared to in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in  from million in sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of our aggressive marketing of our software products  which included the creation of a department devoted exclusively to software marketing 
despite the steep increase in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase by only year over year in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased expenditure on research and development in the area of convergent billing software and the aggressive upgrading of our aiobs and aimc software products 
our strategy for was to accelerate spending in sales and marketing and research and development in order to scale our business quickly and take advantage of the rapid acceleration of the build out of china s internet infrastructure 
we expect to continue to benefit from this investment in while we expect our research and development expenses for to increase by in absolute dollar terms  we expect these expenses to remain constant as a percentage of net revenues  at approximately 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in included in this amount was  in amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ai zhejiang 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to increased legal compliance and investor relations expenses related to our becoming a public company in march of in  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively constant in dollar terms 
amortization of deferred stock compensation decreased from million in to million in because deferred stock compensation arising from awards in had been completely amortized and no new deferred stock compensation has arisen since october of other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  increased from income of  in to income of million in  primarily due to interest income on the proceeds of our initial public offering in march of minority interest 
in  minority interest of  represented the portion of our loss before minority interests attributable to the other shareholders of marsec and guangdong wangying 
net loss income 
net loss decreased to million in  from million in  because we began generating net income in the second quarter of for the second  third and fourth quarters of  we had net income of approximately   and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to generate net income in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million in from million in network solutions accounted for million of this increase  primarily due to a greater number of projects in progress 
software revenues accounted for the balance of the increase in total revenues 
the growth in software revenues reflected greater demand for our products and faster development and installation of our products 
asiainfo zhejiang  which we acquired in april  contributed revenues of million  a large part of which were software license revenues 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the overall expansion of our business and increased salary costs for our systems integration and design engineering personnel 
we periodically review our warranty cost estimates based on historical data and in costs of revenues were reduced by million as a result of a revision to warranty cost estimates in line with our historical experience  primarily contracts whose warranty period had expired in gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in  primarily due to these revisions to warranty cost estimates 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the overall expansion of our business  costs associated with the acquisition of asiainfo zhejiang and higher operating expenses resulting from the comprehensive review of human resource policies discussed above 
of this amount  asiainfo zhejiang contributed operating expenses of million 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from to  primarily due to increased investment in sales and marketing and research and development personnel to drive the future growth of our business 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the implementation of new marketing activities  the hiring of additional personnel  higher compensation levels and the effect of the acquisition of asiainfo zhejiang 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased salary costs associated with the expansion of our software business  and the effect of the acquisition of asiainfo zhejiang  which amounted to  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of asiainfo zhejiang and an increase in provisions for bad debts 
the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of asiainfo zhejiang was  in we experienced collection problems under a contract with the heilongjiang provincial telecommunications authority and a provision of approximately  was made in to reduce the receivable to our estimate of the recoverable amount 
amortization of deferred stock compensation increased from million in to million in as a result of the recognition of expense in for options accounted for as variable awards 
other income and expenses 
other income and expenses  consisting primarily of net interest income and expense  decreased from income of  in to income of  in  primarily due to lower interest rates on cash deposits and higher levels of bank debt 
other 
income taxes increased from a tax benefit of approximately  in to a tax expense of approximately  in  primarily due to an increase in taxable income generated by our chinese subsidiaries 
minority interest 
in  minority interest represented our minority interest in beijing asiainfo data communication technology co  ltd 
asiainfo data through august  at which time asiainfo data ceased to be a consolidated subsidiary 
our remaining interest in asiainfo data was sold in december  asiainfo data was consolidated as a majority owned subsidiary for the entire year of selected unaudited quarterly combined results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the four quarters ended december  and we believe this unaudited information has been prepared substantially on the same basis as the annual audited combined financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
we expect that our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly

we believe that our business is subject to a certain degree of seasonality 
in particular  orders tend to be slow in the first quarter because of two major chinese holidays during this period  including the chinese lunar new year 
in addition  the chinese government conducts its internal budgetary review and allocation process during this period  which has the effect of delaying project commitments by our customers 
in the fourth quarter of  we benefited from a change in regulations issued in that quarter by the department of finance of beijing  which reduced the contributions  effective the beginning of  we were required to make to the government for prc employee benefits 
as a result  during the fourth quarter  we reversed million of costs accrued in the first three quarters of which had previously been expensed  in the first quarter   in the second quarter and  in the third quarter of 
our revenues and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in particular  our business is characterized by limited numbers of large projects 
as discussed above  the majority of revenues for a project are recognized at the point of hardware delivery 
thus  in any given quarter  we may recognize exceptionally large or exceptionally small amounts of revenue  depending on the timing of hardware delivery and size of the project 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock  from which we derived net proceeds of approximately million 
total contributed shareholder equity at december  was million 
our capital requirements are primarily working capital requirements related to hardware sales and costs associated with the expansion of our business  such as research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
we recognize hardware costs in full upon delivery of the hardware to our customers 
in order to minimize our working capital requirements  we generally obtain from our hardware vendors payment terms that are timed to permit us to receive payment from our customers for the hardware before our payments to hardware vendors are due 
however  in certain recent large projects  we obtained less favorable payment terms from our customers  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
we have historically financed our working capital and other financing requirements through careful management of our network solutions billing cycle  private placements of equity securities  our initial public offering in march of and  to a limited extent  bank loans 
our accounts receivable at december  were million  consisting of million in billed receivables and million in unbilled receivables 
our unbilled receivables are based on revenue we have booked through the percentage completion method  but for which we have not yet billed the customer 
our billed receivables are based on revenue we have booked and billed 
the process of billing receivables in china is somewhat different than in the united states  as customers typically do not make full payment until complete satisfaction of the project 
despite these longer receivable cycles  since our inception we have made bad debt provisions for approximately of our accounts receivable 
as of december   we had total short term credit facilities totaling million expiring in march and may  for working capital purposes  of which unused short term credit facilities were million at that date 
at december   borrowings under these facilities totaled million 
approximately million of the total short term credit facilities was secured by bank deposits of million 
additional borrowings of approximately million were secured by bank deposits of million 
all the borrowings were in renminbi  the currency of china 
the loans carry interest ranging from approximately to per annum and are repayable within one year 
bank deposits pledged as security for these bank loans and short term credit facilities totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  and are presented as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of our initial public offering in march  together with available funds and cash flows generated from operations and the proceeds of our private placements  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion through we may need to raise additional funds in the future  however  in order to fund acquisitions  develop new or enhanced services or products  respond to competitive pressures to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases  or if our business otherwise grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
we plan to raise additional funds  if necessary  through new issuances of shares of our equity securities in one or more public offerings or private placements  or through credit facilities extended by lending institutions 
in the event that we decide to pay dividends to our shareholders  our ability to pay dividends will depend in part on our ability to receive dividends from our operating subsidiaries in china 
foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from our operating subsidiaries in china or convert those payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards boards issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record all derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair market values of those derivative instruments would be accounted for depending on the use of the instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
will be effective for our fiscal year ending december  adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
factors affecting our operating results and our common stock in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and our future prospects the growth of our business is dependent on government budgetary policy  particularly the allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications industry and the internet in china 
virtually all of our large customers are directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the government of china 
accordingly  their business strategies  capital expenditure budgets and spending plans are largely decided in accordance with government policies  which  in turn  are determined on a centralized basis at the highest level by the state planning commission of the prc 
as a result  the growth of our business is heavily dependent on government policies for telecommunications and internet infrastructure 
despite the high priority currently accorded by the government to the development of telecommunications industry and internet infrastructure  and a high level of funding allocated by the government to these sectors  insufficient government allocation of funds to sustain the growth of the telecommunications and internet industries in the future could reduce the demand for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business 
furthermore  if demand for internet and telecommunications service from chinese enterprises and households is not as strong as projected  our customers investment in internet and telecommunications infrastructure is likely to decrease 
although china s internet population has increased dramatically in recent years and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate from to  the average annual household income level in china is low relative to other industrialized nations 
this may dampen the overall commercial impact of the internet s growth in china relative to other countries 
laws and regulations applicable to the internet in china remain unsettled and could have a material adverse effect on the internet s growth and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business 
growth of the internet in china could be materially adversely affected by governmental regulation of the industry 
due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services  new regulations have been and may continue to be adopted with respect to the internet or other online services 
the ministry of information industry has recently promulgated the administrative measures on internet information services and related implementing regulations 
among other things  the administrative measures on internet information services require internet content providers to obtain approval from the ministry of information industry before they can list securities overseas or obtain foreign investment  require internet content providers to obtain licenses from various ministries  depending on the nature of the content they provide  and require internet content providers to police their content in order to prevent restricted material from appearing on their websites 
because we are engaged in internet infrastructure development and internet related software development and licensing  we do not expect these new regulations to have a direct impact on us 
however  we cannot guarantee that the adoption of these regulations or other regulations will not slow the growth of the internet or other online services in china 
in particular  the prohibitions against a broad but vague range of information on the internet such as information that is damaging to national security  national interest  and social order  the relevant monitoring  record keeping  reporting and other administrative burdens imposed on internet access and content providers  and the severe penalties for violations of these regulations could have a chilling effect on internet content providers and internet users and could lead to increased compliance costs for internet content providers 
any slow down in the growth of the internet in china could in turn lead to reduced internet traffic  and a decrease in the demand for our network solutions and internet related software products 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer significantly 
we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers  such as china telecom  china unicom  china mobile and china netcom 
china telecom accounted for almost all of our revenues in and in  china telecom  together with china unicom  accounted for almost all of our revenues 
at december   china telecom and china unicom accounted for approximately of our backlog net of hardware costs 
in the future  we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues from china unicom  china mobile and china netcom 
the loss  cancellation or deferral of any large contract by any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenues  and consequently our profits 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products and services can cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our services and products involves a significant commitment of its resources and an extended evaluation 
as a result  our sales cycle tends to be lengthy 
we spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about features and applications of our services and products 
because our major customers operate large and complex networks  they usually expand their networks in large increments on a sporadic basis 
the combination of these factors can cause our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly 
other factors that may affect us include the following fluctuation in demand for our products and services as a result of budgetary cycles of our large customers  particularly state owned enterprises  the reduction  delay  interruption or termination of one or more infrastructure projects  and our ability to introduce  develop and deliver new software products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
a large part of the contract amount of a network solutions project usually relates to hardware procurement 
since we recognize most of the revenues relating to hardware plus a portion of contract services revenues at the time of hardware delivery  the timing of hardware delivery can cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate significantly 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon 
it is likely that our operating results in some periods may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will probably decline  perhaps significantly more in percentage terms than the decline in operating results 
our working capital requirements may increase significantly 
we typically purchase hardware for our customers as part of our turn key total solutions services 
we generally require our customers to pay of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery 
we typically place orders for hardware against back to back orders from customers and seek favorable payment terms from hardware vendors 
this policy has historically minimized our working capital requirements 
however  for certain large and strategically important projects  we have agreed to payment of less than of the invoice value of the hardware upon delivery in order to maintain competitiveness 
wider adoption of less favorable payment terms or delays in hardware deliveries would require us to increase our working capital needs 
our working capital requirements may also increase significantly in order to fund more rapid expansion and acquisitions  to develop new or enhanced services or products  to respond to competitive pressure to compete successfully for larger projects involving higher levels of hardware purchases or otherwise if our business grows more rapidly than we currently predict 
an increase in our working capital needs may require that we raise additional funding sooner than we presently expect 
we have sustained losses in prior years and may incur slower earnings growth  earnings declines or net losses in the future 
although we made a net profit in and  we have sustained losses in   and prior years 
there are no assurances that we can regain or sustain profitability or avoid net losses in the future 
we continue to expect that certain of our operating expenses will increase as our business grows 
the level of these expenses will be largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage will be fixed 
as a result  any delays in expanding sales volume and generating revenue could result in substantial operating losses 
any such developments could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
management s ability to implement adequate control systems will be critical to the successful management of our future growth 
in recent years  we have been expanding our operations rapidly  both in size and scope 
our growth places a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
our ability to market our products successfully and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we will need to continue to improve our financial  managerial and operational controls and reporting systems  and to expand  train and manage our work force 
we may not be able to implement adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner 
we face a competitive labor market in china for skilled personnel and therefore are highly dependent on the skills and services of our existing key skilled personnel and our ability to hire additional skilled employees 
competition for highly skilled software design  engineering and sales and marketing personnel is intense in china 
failure to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs could impair our growth 
competition for skilled personnel comes primarily from a wide range of foreign companies active in china  many of which have substantially greater resources than we have 
limitations on our ability to hire and train a sufficient number of personnel at all levels would limit our ability to undertake projects in the future and could cause us to lose market share 
since our business has been evolving  our historical financial information may not be an appropriate basis on which to evaluate us or our prospects 
we moved our operations from texas to china in and began generating significant network solutions revenue in and significant software license revenues in we expect our business to continue to evolve as the internet and telecommunications markets in china change and expand 
in particular  we are currently investing substantial personnel and financial resources in expanding our software business  which we expect to account for a significantly greater portion of our operating expenses and revenues than in the past 
as a result  our historical financial data may not provide a meaningful basis upon which investors may evaluate us and our prospects 
you should consider the risks and difficulties encountered by companies like ours in a new and rapidly evolving market 
our ability to sell products and our level of success depend  among other things  on the level of demand for internet related  professional it services and software products in china 
we extend warranties to our network solutions customers that expose us to potential liabilities 
we customarily provide our customers with one to three year warranties  under which we agree to maintain the installed systems at no additional cost to our customers 
the maintenance services cover both hardware and our proprietary and third party software products 
although we seek to arrange back to back warranties with hardware and software vendors  we have the primary responsibility to maintain the installed hardware and software 
our contracts do not have disclaimers or limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages  nor do we cap the amounts recoverable for damages 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance policy with respect to our exposure to warranty claims 
although to date we have not incurred any liability for special  consequential or incidental damages  failure of our installed projects to operate properly could give rise to substantial claims against us that in turn could materially and adversely affect us 
we sell our large systems integration projects on a fixed price  fixed time basis which exposes us to risks associated with cost overruns and delays 
we sell substantially all of our systems integration projects on a fixed price  fixed time basis 
failure to complete a fixed price  fixed time project within budget and the required time frame would expose us to cost overruns and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in contracts with our customers  we typically agree to pay late completion fines up to of the total contract value 
in large scale internet infrastructure projects  there are many factors beyond our control which could cause delays or cost overruns 
in this event  we would be exposed to cost overruns and liable for late completion fines 
a part of our network solutions business is installing internet network hardware 
if we are unable to obtain access to such equipment in a timely manner or on acceptable commercial terms  our business  particularly our relationships with our customers  may be materially and adversely affected 
we may become less competitive if we are unable to develop or acquire new products or enhancements to our software products that are marketable on a timely and cost effective basis 
we continually develop new services and proprietary software products 
unexpected technical  operational  distribution or other problems could delay or prevent the introduction of one or more of these products or services or any products or services that we may plan to introduce in the future 
moreover  we cannot be sure that any of these products and services will achieve widespread market acceptance or generate incremental revenues 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of poor law enforcement 
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our intellectual property rights  which we protect through a combination of copyright  trade secret law and trademark law 
we have filed trademark applications with the united states trademark office  the trademark bureau of the state administration of industry and commerce in china and the trade marks registry in hong kong 
we have also been granted copyrights by the state copyright bureau in china with respect to internet related software products  although we have not applied for copyright protection elsewhere including the united states 
despite these precautions  the legal regime protecting intellectual property rights in china is weak 
because the chinese legal system in general  and the intellectual property regime in particular  are relatively weak  it is often difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in china 
in addition  there are other countries where effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited  and the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to control the ultimate destination of our products 
we do not own any patents and have not filed any patent applications  as we do not believe that the benefits of patent protection outweigh the costs of filing and updating patents for our software products 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants  and control access to  and distribution of  our documentation and other licensed information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our licensed services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our licensed technology is difficult and there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future in order to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
we are exposed to certain business and litigation risks with respect to technology rights held by third parties 
we currently license technology from third parties and intend to do so increasingly in the future 
as we introduce services that require new technology  we will probably need to license additional third party technology 
we cannot assure you that these technology licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay or compromise our ability to introduce new services 
in addition  we may or may allegedly breach the technology rights of others and incur legal expenses and damages  which  in the aggregate  could be substantial 
investors may not be able to enforce judgments by united states courts against us 
we are incorporated in the state of delaware 
however  a majority of our directors  executive officers and shareholders live outside the united states  principally in beijing  china and hong kong 
also  all or most of our assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  you may not be able to effect service of process upon us or these persons within the united states  or enforce against us or these persons judgments obtained in united states courts  including judgments relating to the federal securities laws of the united states 
we do not intend to pay and may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to declare any dividends 
we currently intend to retain future earnings to fund growth 
furthermore  if we decide to pay dividends  foreign exchange and other regulations in china may restrict our ability to distribute retained earnings from china or convert these payments from renminbi into foreign currencies 
in addition  loan agreements and contractual arrangements we enter into in the future may also restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the fact that our business is conducted in both us dollars and renminbi may subject us to currency exchange rate risk due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between these two currencies 
substantially all of our revenues  expenses and liabilities are denominated in either us dollars or renminbi 
as a result  we are subject to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between these currencies 
most contracts we enter into with our customers provide for price adjustments reflecting foreign exchange fluctuations  however  we cannot guarantee that future contracts will contain such provisions 
as a result of the unitary exchange rate system introduced in china on january   the official bank exchange rate for conversion of renminbi to us dollars experienced a devaluation of approximately 
we report our financial results in us dollars  therefore  any future devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar may have an adverse effect upon our reported net income 
substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all our revenues and expenses relating to the service component of our network solutions business and software business are denominated in renminbi 
although  in general  our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited  the value in our shares may be affected by the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi  while our shares are traded in us dollars 
furthermore  a decline in the value of the renminbi could reduce the us dollar value of earnings from  and our investment in  our subsidiaries in china 
the markets in which we sell our services and products are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the network solutions market for internet infrastructure in china is new and rapidly changing 
our competitors in the market mainly include domestic systems integrators such as ztec and autian 
although we are a leading player in this market  there are many large multinational companies with substantial  existing information technology operations in other markets in china  that have significantly greater financial  technological  marketing and human resources 
should they decide to enter the network solutions market for internet infrastructure  this could hurt our profitability and erode our market share 
in the customer management and billing software market  we compete with both international and local software providers 
in the online billing segment  we compete primarily with portal software  mind and ztec  and in the wireless billing segment  we compete with more than ten local competitors 
the messaging software sector is highly competitive 
our principal competitors in this sector are open wave formerly known as software 
com and netease 
currently  due in part to a stringent approval system for providers of wireless billing software in china and competitive pricing offered by domestic companies  some multinational information technology companies have been deterred from entering this market 
in view of the gradual deregulation of the chinese telecommunications industry and china s pending entry into the wto  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors into the customer management and billing software market 
our competitors  some of whom have greater financial  technical and human resources than us  may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of new products or services 
it is possible that competition in the form of new competitors or alliances  joint ventures or consolidation among existing competitors may decrease our market share 
increased competition could result in lower personnel utilization rates  billing rate reductions  fewer customer engagements  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our profits and overall financial condition 
political and economic policies of the chinese government could affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
since the establishment of the prc in  the communist party has been the governing political party in china 
the highest bodies of leadership are the politburo of the communist party  the central committee and the national people s congress 
the state council  which is the highest institution of government administration  reports to the national people s congress and has under its supervision various commissions  agencies and ministries  including the ministry of information industry  the telecommunications regulatory body of the chinese government 
since the late s  the chinese government has been reforming the chinese economic system 
although we believe that economic reform and the macroeconomic measures adopted by the chinese government have had and will continue to have a positive effect on the economic development in china  there can be no assurance that the economic reform strategy will not from time to time be modified or revised 
such modifications or revisions  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and investment in the internet and the telecommunications industry in china 
such developments could reduce  perhaps significantly  the demand for our products and services 
there is no guarantee that the chinese government will not impose other economic or regulatory controls that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  changes in political  economic and social conditions in china  adjustments in policies of the chinese government or changes in laws and regulations could adversely affect our industry in general and our competitive position in particular 
the failure of china to gain entry into the wto could negatively impact the chinese economy and our growth 
failure by china to join the world trade organization  as expected  could slow down china s economic growth and could result in lower than forecasted spending in the telecommunications sector in china  which in turn could adversely affect the demand for our products and services from our large customers 
uncertainties with respect to the chinese legal system could adversely affect us 
our principal operating subsidiary  asiainfo technologies  is a wholly foreign owned enterprise for chinese legal purposes  which means that it is incorporated in china and wholly owned by foreign investors 
asiainfo technologies  along with our indirect majority owned subsidiary  marsec systems inc  are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in china in general and laws applicable to wholly foreign owned enterprises in particular 
the legislation and regulations over the past years have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in china 
however  since the chinese legal system is still evolving  the interpretations of many laws  regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws  regulations and rules involve uncertainties  which may limit remedies available to us 
high technology and emerging market shares have historically experienced extreme volatility and may subject you to losses 
the trading price of our shares may be subject to significant market volatility due to investor perceptions of us and investments relating to china and asia  developments in the internet and telecommunications industries  variations in our operating results from period to period due to project timing  and announcements of new products or services by us or by our competitors 
in addition  the high technology sector of the stock market frequently experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
future sales of shares by our company or existing shareholders could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
a small number of shareholders controls us 
our six largest shareholders  warburg pincus ventures  chinavest group  and intel pacific  inc  and their affiliates  as well as edward tian  one of our directors  james ding  our president and chief executive officer  and louis lau  our chairman  in the aggregate  control over of our voting stock 
as a result  these shareholders are able to control all matters requiring shareholder approval  including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a sale of our assets and the terms of future equity financings 
the combined voting power of our large shareholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could prevent a change of control of asiainfo and prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium on their common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock 
without any further vote or action on the part of our stockholders  the board of directors has the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if it is ever issued  may have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of common stock 
although the issuance of this preferred stock will provide us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have authorized the size of our board of directors to be not less than three nor more than nine directors 
the terms of the office of the seven member board of directors have been divided into three classes class i  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in  class ii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in  and class iii  whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in this classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date when the person became an interested stockholder unless  subject to exceptions  the business combination or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner 
generally  a business combination includes a merger  asset or stock sale  or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with our underlying liabilities 
to date  we have not entered into any types of derivatives to hedge against interest rate changes  nor do we speculate in foreign currency 
however  we do maintain a significant portion of our cash deposits in us dollars to avoid currency risk related to renminbi 
a portion of these us dollar deposits are used to collateralize renminbi denominated loans from chinese banks 
because substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to hardware sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses relating to the service component of our network solutions business and software business are denominated in renminbi  we do not have significant exposure to either the us dollar or renminbi 
thus  we do not believe that it is necessary to enter into derivatives contracts to hedge our exposures to either currency
