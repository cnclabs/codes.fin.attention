as of january   the company had  in cash  and as of january   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal  the company used approximately million to fund the acquisition of one restaurant and fund capital improvements to existing and acquired restaurants 
during fiscal  the company used approximately million to fund the acquisition of six restaurants and fund capital improvements to existing and acquired restaurants 
cash provided by operations was approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal the company intends to modestly expand operations through the acquisition of regional buffet chains or through the purchase of existing restaurants which would be converted to one of the company s existing restaurant concepts 
in many instances  management believes that existing restaurant locations can be acquired and converted to the company s prototype at a lower cost 
management estimates the cost of acquiring and converting leased property to one of the existing concepts to be approximately  to  these costs consist primarily of exterior and interior appearance modifications  new table  chairs and food bars and the addition of certain kitchen and food service equipment 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to acquire additional restaurant chains or locations or  if acquired  that these restaurants will have a positive contribution to the company s results of operations 
on october   the company entered into a million syndicated bank financing agreement led by fleetboston financial corporation formerly known as bankboston  na the credit facility consists of a million  year term loan the term loan facility and a million  year revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility refinanced existing indebtedness and provided capital for the repurchase of star buffet common stock and acquisitions 
the term loan facility balance was  as of april  principal payments under the term loan facility are due in quarterly installments until the final maturity in october borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used for the company s new unit development and working capital needs 
all outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility will become due in october the revolving credit facility balance was  on april  the company believes that available cash  cash flow from operations and amounts available under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital  and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
if the company requires additional funds to support its working capital requirements or for other purposes  it may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity and or debt financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s operating plans  the unavailability of a credit facility  the acceleration of the company s expansion plans  lower than anticipated revenues  increased expenses  potential acquisitions of other events will not cause the company to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass any associated higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
however  management has emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the competitive pressure within the quick service restaurant industry 
new accounting pronouncement the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in sfas no 
 as amended by sfas nos 
and  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
because the company does not currently hold any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities  the adoption of sfas no 
 on january   did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk the company s principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on our million credit facility  of which  remained outstanding as of april  borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at the prime rate or at libor plus an applicable margin based on certain financial ratios averaging in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately  in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of our credit facility and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt at april  all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on us and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk the company purchases certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically the company uses these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing  menu mix or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower operating margins for our restaurant concepts
