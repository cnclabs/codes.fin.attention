item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless specifically noted  the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets 
for the twelve months ended december   there is no material difference between the consolidated operations and assets of awr and the operations and assets of scw 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in this report including the documents incorporated herein by reference are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as registrant believes  anticipates  expects or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe registrant s future plans  objectives  estimates or goals are also forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  the california energy crisis  liquidity and capital resources  opportunities related to operations and maintenance of water systems owned by governmental entities and other utilities and providing related services  and accounting matters 
actual results in each case could differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as utility restructuring  including ongoing local  state and federal activities  future economic conditions  including changes in customer demand and changes in water and energy supply cost  future climatic conditions  and legislative  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs 
results of operations years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in increased by to per share as compared to per share for the comparable period of the increase in the recorded results primarily reflects higher revenues at scw during  as is more fully discussed below 
for the year ended december   fully diluted earnings were per share 
registrant had no dilutive shares outstanding in water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in the increase was due to three factors i a increase in water sales to customers of scw  ii increased water rates authorized by the cpuc for certain of scw s water customers  and iii additional sales from ccwc 
new rates in four customer service areas and implementation of regional rates in the customer service areas that comprise scw s region iii were effective june  additional increases in reflected the general rate case step and attrition increases for a number of scw s ratemaking areas effective see the section entitled regulatory matters for more information 
electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to a increase in kilowatt hour sales  primarily by residential and industrial customers 
other revenues rose from  in to  in due to higher management fees from increased non regulated activities with existing contracts of registrant s asus unit 
purchased water costs in increased by to million as compared to million in due to a increase in volumes purchased 
the increase was also affected by a total of million in refunds from the water replenishment district of southern california wrd received during there were no similar refunds received in costs of power purchased for resale to customers in scw s bear valley electric division in increased by to million from the million recorded in due primarily to significant increases in wholesale market prices for energy in the state of california 
most of this increase has been included in the electric supply cost balancing account that  as described below  partially insulates earnings from the effects of the significantly increased power costs  unless recovery of these costs is disallowed 
due to the nature of the regulatory process  there is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of costs or additional delays in the recovery of costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run up in costs 
see the sections entitled regulatory matters and electric energy situation in california for more information 
costs of power purchased for pumping increased slightly by to million in as compared to million recorded in  chiefly as a result of an increase in energy costs  the effect of which was partially offset by a decrease in pumped groundwater in scw s water supply mix 
groundwater production assessments increased by to million in from million in due primarily to increased costs for excess pumping in scw s san gabriel and san dimas customer service areas to meet summer demands 
a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
conversely  a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
scw has a higher net under collected position in than in reflecting the increased energy costs in scw s bear valley electric service area  the aggregate effect of which was partially offset by new water rates effective during  authorized to collect previously incurred supply costs in scw s various water customer service areas  as well as the wrd refunds during as discussed previously 
see the section entitled regulatory matters for more information 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit cost of supply costs  which are outside of the immediate control of scw 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in the actual water supply mix as compared to that mix authorized for recovery in rates 
in  scw s overall water supply mix improved slightly over that mix authorized in rates due to additional well production capability coming on line during the year 
there is no assurance that the favorable mix can be sustained in future periods since actual results are affected by availability and quality of water  both purchased and produced from scw s wells 
see the section entitled water supply for more information 
other operating expenses increased by from the million recorded in reflecting increased costs for water treatment  and increased labor and billing costs due to additional billing and customer service contracts obtained by asus 
administrative and general expenses decreased by to million in from million recorded in the decrease is due primarily to booking reduced reserves for litigation in and a reduction in pension expenses 
see the section entitled legal proceedings in part i for more information 
depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  depreciation on which began in maintenance expense increased to million in compared to the recorded million in due principally to increased maintenance on scw s water supply sources and maintenance of water mains 
taxes on income increased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in due primarily to a increase in pre tax income  the effect of which was partially offset by slightly lower effective tax rate 
property and other tax expense increased by in to million due to higher property valuation  increased franchise fees associated with higher revenues  and increased payroll taxes due to increased labor costs 
the loss of  in other income recorded for is related to the effect of recording amortization and interest expenses  starting january  on scw s entitlement in the state water project 
see note of the notes to financial statements for more information 
in  interest expense increased by to million from the million recorded in due to additional short term borrowing at higher rates  incurred by scw to temporarily fund its capital expenditures 
results of operations years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in increased by to per share as compared to per share for the comparable period of registrant had no dilutive securities outstanding during and  therefore basic and fully diluted earnings per share are the same 
the increase in the recorded results primarily reflects higher revenues at scw during as is more fully discussed below 
water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in water sales volumes in were higher than due primarily to the much drier and warmer weather conditions throughout southern california in than in additional increases in revenues were due to the general rate increases in six of scw s customer service areas effective january   which were applicable to of scw s water customers 
electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to a increase in kilowatt hour sales  primarily by industrial power users 
the sales increase was partially offset by the lower billing rates of industrial customers relative to residential customers 
other revenues increased from  to  in due to increased management fees resulting from new asus service contracts established in the year and increased activities with existing contracts 
purchased water costs in increased to million as compared to million in due to a increase in volumes purchased 
the increase also reflects reduced reimbursements in from potentially responsible parties related to groundwater contamination in scw s culver city customer service area of approximately  compared with reimbursements of million in costs of power purchased for resale in to customers in scw s bear valley electric division increased by to million from the million recorded in due primarily to additional energy demand charges from the energy supplier serving scw s bear valley electric service unit in most of this increase has been included in the electric supply cost balancing account that  as described below  partially insulates earnings from the effects of the significantly increased power costs  unless recovery of costs is disallowed 
due to the nature of the regulatory process  there is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of costs or additional delays in the recovery of costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run up in costs 
see the sections entitled regulatory matters and electric energy situation in california for more information 
costs of power purchased for pumping increased by to million in chiefly as a result of an increase in pumped groundwater in scw s water supply mix due to increased sales volumes 
groundwater production assessments decreased by to million in from million in due to reduced quantity rates in scw s metropolitan and san dimas customer service areas 
a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
in  recovery of previously under collected supply costs was lower than due to the previously discussed increase in energy demand charges  the effect of which was partially offset by new rates effective january authorized to implement new supply costs and to increase collection of previously under collected costs 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit cost of supply costs that are outside of the immediate control of scw 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in the actual water supply mix for water operation as compared to that mix authorized for recovery in rates 
in  scw s overall water supply mix improved favorably over that mix authorized in rates resulting in additional income 
there is no assurance that the favorable mix can be sustained in future periods since actual results are affected by availability and quality of water  both purchased and produced from scw s wells 
other operating expenses increased by from the million recorded in due to increased costs for water treatment  and higher uncollectible provisions as a result of increased revenues 
administrative and general expenses increased by to million in from the million recorded in the increase is due to costs associated with various acquisition projects  increased employee benefit costs  and additional amounts reserved for certain legal proceedings 
in  maintenance expense increased to the million level compared to the recorded million in due principally to increased maintenance on registrant s water supply sources  and costs incurred on main replacements 
the wet weather conditions during the first part of also hampered planned maintenance activities  thereby reducing maintenance expense in depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  depreciation on which began in taxes on income increased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in due to a increase in pre tax income and a higher effective tax rate in resulting from the turn around of depreciation related temporary differences  the benefits of which were previously flowed through for ratemaking purposes 
property and other taxes increased by in to million due primarily to increased franchise fees resulting from higher revenues  and increased payroll taxes from higher wages and additional personnel 
other income decreased by in due primarily to the flow through of tax benefits related to refinancing of long term debt in december for which there were no similar benefits in interest expense increased by to million primarily due to the issuance of million in long term debt in january  partially offset by the retirement of million of notes in december liquidity and capital resources awr funds its operating expenses and pays dividends on its outstanding common and preferred shares principally through dividends from scw 
awr has a registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec for issuance  from time to time  of up to million in common shares  preferred shares and or debt securities 
on august   awr issued  common shares at per share under this registration statement 
net proceeds from the offering have been used to fund a portion of the purchase price of ccwc and will be invested in scw 
as of december   approximately  remained for issuance under this registration statement 
awr completed the acquisition of the common stock of ccwc on october  for an aggregate value of million  including assumption of approximately million in debt 
awr maintains a revolving credit facility with a million aggregate borrowing capacity 
at december   no amount was outstanding under this facility 
scw funds the majority of its operating expenses  payments on its debt  and dividends on its outstanding common shares through internal sources 
internal sources of cash flow are provided primarily by retention of a portion of earnings  amortization of deferred charges  and depreciation expense 
internal cash generation is influenced by factors such as weather patterns  environmental regulation  litigation  changes in supply costs  and timing of rate relief 
see the sections entitled risk factors and electric energy situation in california for more information 
because of the seasonal nature of its water and electric operations  scw utilizes its short term borrowing capacity to finance current operating expenses  including the expenses for its bear valley electric customer service area 
see the section entitled electric energy situation in california for more information 
the aggregate short term borrowing capacity available to scw under its three bank lines of credit was million as of december   of which a total of million was then outstanding 
scw routinely employs short term bank borrowing as an interim financing source prior to funding capital expenditures on a long term basis as previously discussed 
scw also relies on external sources  including equity investments from awr  long term debt  contributions in aid of construction  advances for construction and install and convey advances  to fund the majority of its construction expenditures 
at december   million was available for issuance by scw as long term debt under a registration statement filed in in january  scw issued the remaining million of long term debt with the proceeds used to reduce bank borrowing 
during  scw anticipates filing a registration statement with the sec for issuance  from time to time  of additional debt securities 
ccwc funds the majority of its operating expenses  payments on its debt and dividends  if any  through internal sources 
ccwc also relies on external sources  including long term debt  contributions in aid of construction  advances for construction and install and convey advances  to fund the majority of its construction expenditures 
asus funds its operating expenses primarily through contractual management fees 
electric energy situation in california the electric energy environment in california has changed as a result of the december cpuc decision on restructuring of california s electric utility industry and state legislation passed in on september   the state of california enacted legislation  california assembly bill as amended by california senate bill  to provide a transition to a competitive market structure  which was expected to provide competition and customer choice  beginning january   with all consumers ultimately participating by scw s bear valley electric customer service area was exempted by the cpuc from compliance with most of the provisions of the cpuc order and the state legislation 
on january   the governor of the state of california proclaimed a state of emergency in california due to shortages of electricity available to certain of california s utilities resulting in blackouts  the unanticipated and dramatic increases in electricity prices and the insufficiency of electricity available from certain of california s utilities to prevent disruption of electric service in california 
the reasons for the high cost of energy are under investigation but are reported to include  among other things  limited supply caused by a lack of investment in new power plants to meet growth in demand  planned and unplanned outages of power plants  lower than usual availability of hydroelectric power from the pacific northwest due to lower than usual precipitation and higher demand for electricity in the region  transmission line constraints and increased prices for natural gas  the fuel used in many of the power plants serving the region 
legislation has been enacted and executive orders issued designed to encourage and accelerate the construction of additional power plants and the repowering and updating of existing power plants to increase the supply of electricity in the state 
a number of investigations have also been instituted as to the causes of the california energy situation and numerous pieces of legislation have been introduced at the california legislature to deal with different aspects of the situation 
the long term impact of these legislative initiatives on scw s bear valley electric division is difficult to predict 
for the short term  however  management expects energy costs to remain high and to continue to be volatile 
all electric energy sold by scw to customers in its bear valley electric customer service area is purchased from others 
historically  scw purchased electric energy from the southern california edison sce unit of edison international 
however  in order to keep electric power costs as low as possible  scw entered into an energy brokerage contract with sempra energy corporation sempra 
scw purchased electric energy for its bear valley electric service division from sempra during the period beginning march  through april  scw changed energy brokers to illinova energy partners illinova beginning may  through april   and with dynegy power marketing  inc dynegy since may  the change to dynegy is a result of the merger between dynegy and illinova 
in response to the potential for rising electricity costs  in may  scw entered into a one year  block forward purchase contract with dynegy for megawatts mw s of electric energy for its bear valley electric service division at a price of per mw 
this contract expires april  dynegy also procured electric energy requirements above the mw forward purchase contract 
the average minimum load at scw s bear valley electric service division has been approximately mw 
the average winter load has been mw with a winter peak of mw when the snowmaking machines at the ski resorts are operating 
electric energy prices in california have risen rather steadily since the passage of the cpuc s electric restructuring decision  although the rate of increase in cost has accelerated in recent months 
during  scw incurred approximately million more in electric energy costs than were included in current rates for electric service 
during  an additional million was incurred 
as of december   scw had approximately million of under collected electric energy costs included in the electric balancing account 
in may  scw filed an advice letter with the cpuc for recovery of approximately million in then under collected power costs over a five year period 
the cpuc has not yet issued a decision in that filing 
scw will file another advice letter for recovery of the additional under collected amount as well as adjustment in base rates to recover over two years estimated electric power costs on a current basis 
management believes that the recovery of these amounts is probable but is unable to predict when  or if  the cpuc will authorize recovery of all or any of these expenses 
see the section entitled regulatory matters for more information 
in january  scw filed advice letters to increase the costs of purchased power included in base water rates for each of its ratemaking districts 
these filings resulted from the increase in electric rates that southern california edison and pacific gas electric company were authorized to implement by the cpuc 
management believes that these filings will be approved but is unable to predict when  or if  the cpuc will authorize recovery of all or any of these expenses 
see the section entitled regulatory matters for more information 
in a continuing effort to control the escalation of electric energy costs for scw s bear valley electric division  scw is considering a number of options including i renegotiation of the block forward purchase of electric energy  ii purchase of electric energy from on site generation facilities installed by a third party and iii use of portable generation to avoid peak energy prices 
each of these options is expected to result in increased electric energy prices for customers of scw s bear valley electric division 
management believes that these solutions in whole or in part represent significant savings for customers relative to reliance on spot purchases in the open market 
management further believes that costs incurred are recoverable from customers although it can give no assurance that the cpuc will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs through rates 
construction program scw maintains an ongoing distribution main replacement program throughout its customer service areas  based on the priority of leaks detected  fire protection enhancement and a reflection of the underlying replacement schedule 
in addition  scw upgrades its electric and water supply facilities in accordance with industry standards  local requirements and cpuc requirements 
scw s board of directors has approved anticipated net capital expenditures of approximately million for of this amount  approximately million is subject to cpuc approval of an advice letter filing 
absent such approval  this amount would be included in the next general rate case filing for scw s region ii 
awr  ccwc and asus have no material capital commitments 
however  asus actively seeks opportunities to own  lease or operate water and wastewater systems for governmental entities  which may involve significant capital commitments 
regulatory matters scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc  which has broad powers with respect to service and facilities  rates  classifications of accounts  valuation of properties  the purchase  disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service  the issuance of securities  the granting of certificates of convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters 
ccwc is subject to regulation by the acc 
rates that scw and ccwc are authorized to charge are determined by the cpuc and the acc  respectively  in general rate cases and are derived using rate base  cost of service and cost of capital  as projected for a future test year in california and using an historical test year  as adjusted in arizona 
rates charged to customers vary according to customer class and rate jurisdiction and are generally set at levels allowing for all prudently incurred costs  including a return on rate base sufficient to pay principal and interest on debt securities  preferred stock distributions and a reasonable rate of return on equity 
rate base generally consists of the original cost of utility plant in service  plus certain other assets  such as working capital and inventory  less accumulated depreciation on utility plant in service  deferred income tax liabilities and certain other deductions 
balancing account adjustments for purchased water and power are permitted in california  but generally not arizona 
neither awr nor asus are regulated by the cpuc 
the cpuc does  however  regulate certain transactions between scw and its affiliates 
the acc also regulates certain transactions between ccwc and its affiliates 
the customer service areas csas of scw are grouped into water districts and electric district for ratemaking purposes 
water rates vary among the ratemaking districts due to differences in operating conditions and costs 
scw monitors operations on a regional basis in each of these districts so that applications for rate changes may be filed  when warranted 
under the cpuc s practices  rates may be increased by three methods general rate case increases grc s  offsets for certain expense increases and advice letter filings related to certain plant additions and other operating cost increases grc s are typically for three year periods  which include step increases for the second and third year 
rates are based on a forecast of expenses and capital costs 
grc s have a typical regulatory lag of one year 
offset rate increases typically have a two to four month regulatory lag 
the following table lists information on estimated annual rate changes during   and in s supply balancing general cost account and step advice year offset amortization increases letters total grc step increase for scw s region ii and general office allocation step increases for the arden cordova  bay point  simi valley and santa maria csas were effective beginning january  step increase for ojai became effective april  attrition increases for arden cordova and bay point csas were also in effect beginning january effective june   scw was authorized by the cpuc to implement new increased rates for four water ratemaking districts in scw s region iii and to combine tariff schedules into regional rates for the customer service areas that make up scw s region iii 
despite the delay in obtaining cpuc approval of these rates  which resulted in a loss of approximately million in revenues for the six months ended june   the new rates generated approximately million in additional revenues during the third and fourth quarters of new water rates with an annual increase of approximately million for seven ratemaking districts in scw s region i were implemented in january scw s application to combine the seven ratemaking csas into one regional rate was  however  denied by the cpuc 
step increases of approximately million for csas in scw s region iii were also effective in january an attrition increase of approximately million for region ii was in effect from february a cpuc order authorizing scw to increase rates by  per year went in effect on october  for recovery of capital expenditures associated with yk readiness  not already included in registrant s water rates 
see the section entitled year issue for more information 
in october  the cpuc approved scw s application to provide water and wastewater services to a new housing development located in orange county  california 
an advice letter seeking recovery of approximately million in under collected supply costs for scw s bear valley electric service area has been filed with the cpuc 
scw has also filed for recovery of increased costs of electric power incurred to pump water for its water customers 
see the section entitled electric energy situation in california for more information 
on july   the cpuc concluded its order instituting rulemaking on its own motion to set rules and to provide guidelines for privatization and excess capacity as it relates to investor owned water companies  including registrant 
the cpuc s order establishes a mechanism for sharing gross revenues  after pass through of certain expenses  between customers of scw and shareholders of registrant 
the order also requires water utilities  including registrant  to file an advice letter with the cpuc for approval of services that utilize  in whole or in part  assets or employees reflected in the utility s revenue requirements 
hearings before the cpuc have concluded on scw s application to include an additional million in rate base for a water treatment facility in scw s clearlake service area 
in  the cpuc disallowed the entire million and registrant wrote off the entire amount 
scw s application demonstrated that the previously disallowed portion of the treatment plant is now fully used and useful and is providing service to customers 
a decision on the company s application is anticipated during the second quarter of  which could result in million write up 
recovery of the costs associated with the plant was included in the general rate increase application for scw s clearlake service area 
on april   the cpuc issued an order denying scw s application seeking approval of its recovery through rates of costs associated with its participation in the coastal aqueduct extension of the state water project swp 
scw s participation in the swp commits it to a year entitlement 
scw s investment of approximately million in swp is currently included in other property and investments 
the remaining balance of the related liability of approximately million is recorded as other long term debt 
scw intends to recover its investment in swp either through contributions from developers on a per lot or other basis  or from the sale of its acre foot entitlement in swp 
on november   a final decision from the cpuc concluded that the cpuc has the authority to regulate the service of water utilities with respect to the health and safety of that service  that the department of health services of the state of california dohs requirements governing drinking water quality adequately protect the public health and safety  and that regulated water utilities  including scw  have satisfactorily complied with past and present drinking water quality requirements 
scw has filed for recovery of  in expenses associated with this matter 
management believes that these costs are recoverable although it can give no assurance that the cpuc will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs through rates 
see the section entitled legal proceedings in part i for more information 
on december   scw filed an advice letter with the cpuc  in accordance with a prior cpuc resolution authorizing such a filing  seeking recovery of approximately  in expenses associated with its lawsuits against aerojet general corporation and the department of water resources of the state of california 
scw believes that the recovery of these costs are probable although it can give no assurance that the cpuc will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs through rates 
see the section entitled legal proceedings in part i for more information 
on january   the cpuc staff  scw and peerless water co  a privately owned water company in bellflower  california  signed a settlement agreement  which recommends approval of the proposed acquisition by scw of peerless 
a final decision from the cpuc is anticipated by the second quarter of there are no active regulatory proceedings affecting ccwc or its operations 
environmental matters amendments to federal safe drinking water act on august   amendments the sdwa amendments to the safe drinking water act the sdwa were signed into law 
the sdwa revised the amendments to the sdwa with a new process for selecting and regulating contaminants 
the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa can only regulate contaminants that may have adverse health effects  are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern  and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction 
the epa has published a list of contaminants for possible regulation and must update that list every five years 
in addition  every five years  the epa must select at least five contaminants on that list and determine whether to regulate them 
the new law allows the epa to bypass the selection process and adopt interim regulations for contaminants in order to address urgent health threats 
current regulations  however  remain in place and are not subject to the new standard setting provisions 
the dohs  acting on behalf of the epa  administers the epa s program in california 
the sdwa amendments allow the epa for the first time to base primary drinking water regulations on risk assessment and cost benefit considerations and on minimizing overall risk 
the epa must base regulations on best available  peer reviewed science and data from best available methods 
for proposed regulations that involve the setting of maximum contaminant levels mcl s  the epa must use  and seek public comment on  an analysis of quantifiable and non quantifiable risk reduction benefits and cost for each such mcl 
scw and ccwc currently test their wells and water systems according to requirements listed in the sdwa 
water from wells found to contain levels of contaminants above the established mcl s is treated to reduce contaminants to acceptable levels before it is delivered to customers 
since the sdwa became effective  scw has experienced increased operating costs for testing to determine the levels  if any  of the constituents in scw s sources of supply and additional expense to lower the level of any contaminants in order to meet the mcl standards 
such costs and the costs of controlling any other contaminants may cause scw to experience additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs 
awr is currently unable to predict the ultimate impact that the sdwa amendments might have on the financial position or results of operation of its regulated utility subsidiaries 
the cpuc and acc ratemaking processes provide scw and ccwc with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs associated with water quality 
management believes that such incurred costs will be authorized for recovery by the cpuc and acc  as appropriate 
proposed enhanced surface water treatment rule on july   the epa proposed an enhanced surface water treatment rule eswtr  which would require increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination 
the epa has proposed several versions of the eswtr for promulgation 
the version selected for promulgation will be determined based on data collected by certain water suppliers and forwarded to the epa pursuant to epa s information collection rule  which requires such water suppliers to monitor microbial and other contaminants in their water supplies and to conduct certain tests in respect of such contaminants 
the epa has adopted an interim eswtr applicable only to systems serving greater than  persons 
on april   epa published the proposed long term enhanced surface water treatment rule and filter backwash rule ltfbr in the federal register 
this proposed rule will apply to each of scw s five surface water treatment plants and the ccwc s surface water treatment plant 
it basically extends the requirements of the eswtr to systems serving less than  persons and will require some systems to institute changes to the return of recycle filter backwash flows within the treatment process to reduce the effects of recycle on compromising microbial control 
registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate impact of the ltfbr  but it is anticipated that all five scw s plants and the ccwc s plant will achieve compliance within the three year to five year time frames identified by epa 
regulation of disinfection disinfection by products scw and ccwc are also subject to the new regulations concerning disinfection disinfection by products dbp s  stage i of which regulations were effective in november with full compliance required by stage i requires reduction of trihalomethane contaminants from micrograms per liter to micrograms per liter 
two of scw s systems are immediately impacted by this rule 
scw implemented modifications to the treatment process in its bay point and cordova systems 
it is anticipated that both systems will be in full compliance by a third scw plant will require treatment modifications in order to comply with this rule 
scw is preparing to conduct studies in calipatria to determine the best treatment methods to comply with this rule 
the epa will adopt stage ii rules pertaining to dbp s by summer of the epa is not allowed to use the new cost benefit analysis provided for in the sdwa amendments for establishing the stage ii rules applicable to dbp s but may utilize the regulatory negotiating process provided for in the sdwa amendments to develop the stage ii rule 
the final rule is expected by ground water rule on may   the epa published the proposed ground water rule gwr  which establishes multiple barriers to protect against bacteria and viruses in drinking water systems that use ground water 
the proposed rule will apply to all us public water systems that use ground water as a source 
the proposed gwr includes system sanitary surveys conducted by the state to identify significant deficiencies  hydrogeologic sensitivity assessments for undisinfected systems  source water microbial monitoring by systems that do not disinfect and draw from hydrogeologically sensitive aquifer or have detected fecal indicators within the system s distribution system  corrective action  and compliance monitoring for systems which disinfect to ensure that they reliably achieve log inactivation or removal of viruses 
the gwr is scheduled to be issued as a final regulation in while no assurance can be given as to the nature and cost of any additional compliance measures  if any  scw and ccwc do not believe that such regulations will impose significant compliance costs  since they already currently engages in disinfection of their groundwater systems 
regulation of radon and arsenic the final regulation on arsenic was published in january with a new federal standard of parts per billion ppb 
compliance with an mcl of ppb will require implementation of wellhead treatment remedies for eight affected wells in scw s system and three wells in ccwc s system 
however  the new administration has put a temporary hold on the ruling and awr is unable to predict if or when the rule will be officially released 
the epa has proposed new radon regulations following a national academy of sciences risk assessment and study of risk reduction benefits associated with various mitigation measures 
the national academy of sciences study is in agreement with much of epa s original findings but has slightly reduced the ingestion risk initially assumed by epa 
epa established an mcl of pico curies per liter based on the findings and has also established an alternative mcl of pico curies per liter  based upon potential mitigation measures for overall radon reduction 
it is our understanding that the united states office of management and budget has sent the radon rule back to epa for reconsideration 
the final rule was expected to be effective in august  but has been delayed 
scw and ccwc currently monitor their wells for radon in order to determine the best treatment appropriate for affected wells 
voluntary efforts to exceed minimum surface water treatment requirements scw is a voluntary member of the epa s partnership for safe water  a national program designed to further protect the public from diseases caused by cryptosporidium and other microscopic organisms 
as a volunteer in the program  scw commits to exceed minimum operating requirements governing surface water treatment  optimize surface water treatment plant operations and ensure that its surface water treatment facilities are performing as efficiently as possible 
fluoridation of water supplies scw is subject to state of california assembly bill  which requires fluoridation of water supplies for public water systems serving more than  service connections 
although the bill requires affected systems to install treatment facilities only when public funds have been made available to cover capital and operating costs  the bill requires the cpuc to authorize cost recovery through rates should public funds for operation of the facilities  once installed  become unavailable in future years 
matters relating to scw s arden cordova system in january  scw was notified that ammonium perchlorate in amounts above the state determined action level had been detected in three of its wells serving its arden cordova system 
aerojet general corp 
has  in the past  used ammonium perchlorate in their processing as an oxidizer of rocket fuels 
scw took the three wells detected with ammonium perchlorate out of service at that time 
although neither the epa nor the dohs has established a drinking water standard for ammonium perchlorate  dohs has established an action level of parts per billion ppb which required scw to notify customers in its arden cordova customer service area of detection of ammonium perchlorate in amounts in excess of this action level 
in april  scw found ammonium perchlorate in three additional wells and  at that time  removed those wells from service until it was determined that the levels were below the state determined action level 
those wells were returned to service 
scw periodically monitors these wells to determine that levels of perchlorate are below the action level currently in effect 
in february  scw was informed that nitrosodimethylamine ndma had been detected in amounts in excess of the epa reference dosage for health risks in four of its wells in its arden cordova system 
the wells have been removed from service 
another well was also removed from service in september due to the contamination 
ndma is an additional by product from the production of rocket fuel and it is believed that such contamination is related to the activities of aerojet general corp 
aerojet general corp 
has reimbursed scw for constructing a pipeline to interconnect with the city of folsom water system to provide an alternative source s of water supply in scw s arden cordova customer service area and has reimbursed scw for costs associated with the drilling and equipping of two new wells 
as of december   aerojet general corp 
has previously reimbursed scw million 
the remainder of the costs is subject to further reimbursement  including interest 
the reimbursement from aerojet general corp 
reduces scw s utility plant and costs of purchased water 
on october   scw filed a lawsuit against the california regional water quality control board crwqcb alleging that the crwqcb has willfully allowed portions of the sacramento county groundwater basin to be injected with chemical pollution that is contaminating the underground water supply in scw s rancho cordova customer service area 
in a separate case  also filed on october   scw sued aerojet general corp 
for causing the contamination 
on march  aerojet general corp 
filed a cross complaint against scw for negligence and constituting a public nuisance 
scw is unable to determine at this time what  if any  potential liability it may have with respect to the cross complaint  but intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations 
management cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
see the section entitled legal proceedings for more information 
matters relating to scw s culver city system the compound  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  an oxygenate used in reformulated fuels  has been detected in the charnock basin  located in the city of santa monica and within scw s culver city customer service area 
at the request of the regional water quality control board  the city of santa monica and the california environmental protection agency  scw removed two of its wells in the culver city system from service in october to help in efforts to avoid further spread of the mtbe contamination plume 
neither of these wells has been found to be contaminated with mtbe 
scw is purchasing water from the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd at an increased cost to replace the water supply formerly pumped from the two wells removed from service 
pursuant to an agreement with scw in december  two of the potentially responsible parties the participants have reimbursed scw s legal and consulting costs related to this matter and for increased costs incurred by scw in purchasing replacement water 
however  a notice of termination from the participants to the settlement agreement was received in october claiming overpayments for replacement water in excess of scw s water rights 
no assurances can be given that future negotiations will result in complete restoration of scw s water rights or that continued reimbursement of scw s costs will be forthcoming 
on september   the us epa and the los angeles regional water quality control board ordered shell oil company  shell oil products company and equilon enterprises llc to provide replacement drinking water to both scw and the city of santa monica due to mtbe contamination of the charnock sub basin drinking water 
the epa has ordered shell oil to reimburse scw for water replacement costs 
the agencies are continuing to investigate the causes of mtbe pollution and intend to ensure that all responsible parties contribute to its clean up although scw is unable to predict the outcome of the epa s enforcement efforts 
matters relating to scw s yorba linda system the compound  mtbe  has been detected in three wells serving scw s yorba linda system 
two of the wells are standby wells and the third well has not shown mtbe above the dohs secondary standard of ppb at this time 
scw has constructed an interconnection with the mwd to provide for additional supply in the event the third well experienced levels of detection in excess of the dohs standard 
scw has met with the regional water quality control board  the orange county water district  the city of anaheim  the dohs and three potentially responsible parties prp s to define the extent of the mtbe contamination plume and assess the contribution from the prp s 
the prp s have voluntarily initiated a work plan for regional investigation 
while there have not been significant disruptions to the water supply in yorba linda at this point in time  no assurances can be given that mtbe contamination will not increase in the future 
bear valley electric scw has been  in conjunction with the southern california edison unit of edison international  planning to upgrade transmission facilities to kv the kv project in order to meet increased energy and demand requirements 
the kv project is subject to an environmental impact report eir and delays in approval of the eir may impact service in scw s bear valley electric service customer service area 
scw has  however  taken other measures  that will be enacted on an emergency basis  to meet load growth and mitigate delays in approval of the eir 
in addition  third parties willing to construct gas fired generating facilities  sufficient to meet the peaking and future capacity needs of bear valley electric  in exchange for a long term purchase contract have approached scw 
management is unable at this time to predict if such an arrangement will be economically beneficial to customers or if the generating facility can meet all environmental requirements 
see the section entitled electric energy situation in california for more information 
water supply during  scw supplied a total of  ccf of water 
of this amount  approximately came from pumped sources and was purchased from others  principally the mwd 
the remaining amount was supplied by the bureau of reclamation the bureau under a no cost contract 
during  scw supplied  ccf of water  of which came from pumped sources  was purchased  and the remainder was supplied by the bureau 
the mwd is a water district organized under the laws of the state of california for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas within its jurisdiction 
registrant has connections to the water distribution facilities of mwd and other municipal water agencies 
mwd imports water from two principal sources the colorado river and the state water project swp 
available water supplies from the colorado river and the swp have historically been sufficient to meet most of mwd s requirements and mwd s supplies from these sources are anticipated to remain adequate through mwd s import of water from the colorado river is expected to decrease in future years due to the requirements of the central arizona project cap 
in response  mwd has taken a number of steps to secure additional storage capacity and to increase available water supplies  by effecting transfers of water rights from other sources 
scw s water supply and revenues are significantly affected by changes in meteorological conditions 
after being buffeted by the weather extremes of the el nino la nina southern oscillation phenomena  weather in scw s service areas has returned to normal weather patterns 
the october to september precipitation season was near normal 
however due to lower than normal precipitation in the last three months of  the california department of water resources dwr has issued an early indication in january that if the trend continues  allocation of water to state water project contractors  including mwd  could be lowered 
the allocation process in california depends on the sierra snow pack and other sources of water and can vary significantly as the winter season progresses 
january and february brought significant precipitation 
for the water year to end of january  precipitation was or of normal  which was higher than the historical average of of normal 
reservoir storage statewide as of the end of january is of historical storage level 
the mwd  in response to dwr s early indication  has publicly assured consumers that it is well prepared to help the region through one or more dry years 
in order to meet anticipated needs  mwd has in the ten years since the state s last drought invested billions of dollars in water conservation programs  and water recycling  storage and infrastructure programs 
foremost among the safeguards is diamond valley reservoir  a  acre reservoir in southwest riverside county 
capable of holding  acre feet or billion gallons  the reservoir is currently more than half full 
although overall groundwater conditions remain at adequate levels  certain of scw s groundwater supplies have been affected to varying degrees by various forms of contamination which  in some cases  have caused increased reliance on purchased water in its supply mix 
ccwc obtains its water supply from three operating wells and from colorado river water delivered by the cap 
the majority of ccwc s water supply is obtained from its cap allocation and well water is used for peaking capacity in excess of treatment plant capability  during treatment plant shutdown  and to keep the well system in optimal operating condition 
ccwc has an assured water supply designation  by decision and order of the arizona department of water resources  providing in part that  subject to its requirements  ccwc currently has a sufficient supply of ground water and cap water which is physically  continuously and legally available to satisfy current and committed demands of its customers  plus at least two years of predicted demands  for years 
notwithstanding such a designation  ccwc s water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction  in particular owing to interruption or reduction of cap water 
in the event of interruption or reduction of cap water  ccwc can currently rely on its well water supplies for short term periods 
however  in any event  the quantity of water ccwc supplies to some or all of its customers may be interrupted or curtailed  pursuant to the provisions of its tariffs 
business segments awr currently has three principal business units water service and electric distribution utility operations conducted through its scw subsidiary  water service utility operation conducted through its ccwc subsidiary  and non regulated activities through its asus subsidiary 
all activities of scw currently are geographically located within the state of california 
all activities of ccwc are located in the state of arizona 
both scw and ccwc are regulated utilities 
on a stand alone basis  awr has no material assets other than its investments in its subsidiaries

litigation scw has been sued in fourteen water quality related lawsuits a suit filed on april  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a federal superfund site a suit filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery contaminated of water  few of our systems are located in the geographical area covered by this suit a suit filed on december  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed in march  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on june  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site two suits filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on december  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on may  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on april  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on august  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site on september   the first district court of appeal in san francisco  held that the cpuc had preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities and ordered dismissal of a series of lawsuits against water utilities  including seven of the lawsuits against scw 
on october  one group of plaintiffs appealed the decision to the california supreme court  which has accepted the petition 
management cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding 
in march  the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation the oii as a result of these types of suits being filed against water utilities in california 
on november   cpuc issued a final order concluding that the cpuc has the jurisdiction to regulate the service of water utilities with respect to the health and safety of that service  that dohs requirements governing drinking water quality adequately protect the public health and safety  and that regulated water utilities  including scw  have satisfactorily complied with past and present drinking water quality requirements 
the cpuc has authorized a memorandum account for legal expenses incurred by water utilities  including scw  in the water quality lawsuits 
under the memorandum account procedure  scw may recover litigation costs from ratepayers to the extent authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc has not yet authorized scw to recover any of its litigation costs 
as of december   registrant had incurred  in the oii related memorandum account 
environmental regulation scw and ccwc are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations that will result in increasing capital and operating costs 
these regulations include the amendments to the safe drinking water act that require increased testing and treatment of water to reduce specified contaminants to minimum containment levels approved regulations requiring increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination  these regulations will affect scw s five surface water treatment plants and one ccwc s plant additional regulation of disinfection disinfection byproducts expected to be adopted before the end of  these regulations will potentially affect two of scw s systems additional regulations expected to be adopted in requiring disinfection of certain groundwater systems regulation of arsenic issued in january and potential regulation of radon new california requirements to fluoridate public water systems serving over  customers scw and ccwc may be able to recover costs incurred to comply with these regulations through the ratemaking process for our regulated systems 
we may also be able to recover certain of these costs under our contractual arrangements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover costs from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination 
rates and regulation scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc 
ccwc is subject to regulation by the acc 
awr and asus are not directly subject to cpuc regulation 
the cpuc may  however  regulate transactions between scw and awr  including the manner in which overhead costs are allocated between scw and awr and the pricing of services rendered by scw to awr 
the acc also regulates certain transactions between ccwc and its affiliates 
scw s revenues depend substantially on the rates that it is permitted to charge its customers 
scw may increase rates in three ways by filing for a general rate increase by filing for recovery of certain expenses by filing an advice letter for certain plant additions or other operating cost increases  thereby increasing rate base in addition  scw recovers certain water supply costs through a balancing account mechanism 
supply costs include the cost of purchased water and power and groundwater production assessments 
the balancing account mechanism is intended to insulate scw s earnings from changes in water supply costs that are beyond scw s control 
the balancing account is not  however  designed to insulate scw s earnings against changes in supply mix 
as a result  scw may not recover increased costs due to increased use of purchased water through the balancing account mechanism 
in addition  balancing account adjustments  if authorized by the cpuc  may result in either increases or decreases in revenues attributable to supply costs incurred in prior periods  depending upon whether there has been an under collection or over collection of supply costs 
ccwc is not permitted to recover these types of costs through a balancing account mechanism 
there has been a substantial increase in the costs of purchased power in recent months 
due to the nature of the regulatory process  there is a risk of disallowance of full recovery of costs or additional delays in the recovery of costs during any period in which there has been a substantial run up in costs 
there are also a number of matters pending before the cpuc that may affect our future financial results 
these matters include an advice letter filed by scw seeking recovery of cost associated with various water quality litigations an advice letter filed to recover the previous disallowed portion of a water treatment facility in scw s clearlake service area an advice letter filed to recover the under collection of supply costs for scw s bear valley electric service division adequacy of water supplies the adequacy of water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall the amount of water stored in reservoirs the amount used by our customers and others water quality  and legal limitations on use 
reservoir storage statewide as of the end of january is of historical storage level 
and the outlook for water supply in the near term is generally favorable 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used have  however  increased limitations on use to prevent over drafting of groundwater basins 
the import of water from the colorado river  one of scw s important sources of supply  is expected to decrease in future years due to the requirements of the central arizona project 
we also have in recent years taken wells out of service due to water quality problems 
ccwc obtains its water supply from three operating wells and from the colorado river through the cap 
ccwc s water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction if there is an interruption or reduction in cap water 
water shortages could be caused by the above factors and may affect us in several ways they adversely affect supply mix by causing registrant to rely on more expensive purchased water they adversely affect operating costs they may result in an increase in capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supplies and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water we may be able to recover increased operating and construction costs for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover certain of these costs under the terms of our contractual agreements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover these costs from third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
as of december   aerojet general corp 
has previously reimbursed us approximately million for costs associated with the cleanup of the groundwater supply for our arden cordova system and for the increased costs of purchasing water and developing new sources of groundwater supply 
on october   we sued the california regional water quality control board crwqcb alleging that it has willfully allowed portions of the sacramento county groundwater basin to be injected with chemical pollution that is contaminating the underground water supply in our rancho cordova customer service area 
in a separate lawsuit  also filed on october   we sued aerojet general corp 
for causing the contamination 
on march  aerojet general corp 
filed a cross complaint against us for negligence and constituting a public nuisance 
we cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits but we will defend ourselves against these allegations 
two potentially responsible parties on matters relating to the clean up and purchase of replacement water in the charnock basin  located in the cities of santa monica and culver city  have previously reimbursed us for replacement water and certain legal and consulting expenses 
the charnock basin is in our culver city customer service area 
california energy situation the governor of the state of california has proclaimed a state of emergency in california due to shortages of electricity available to certain of california s utilities and the dramatic increases in electricity prices 
a number of investigations have been instituted as to the causes of the california energy situation and numerous pieces of legislation have been introduced at the california legislature to deal with different aspects of the situation 
we are unable to predict the long term impact of these legislative initiatives 
in the short term  we expect energy costs to remain high and to continue to be volatile 
we have been able to partially reduce the effect of these higher energy costs by entering into a long term contract with dynegy for mw of electric energy for its bear valley electric division 
this contract expires on april  and we expect renewal of this agreement will cost significantly more 
in a continuing effort to control the escalation of electric energy costs for scw s bear valley electric division  we are considering a number of options including i renegotiation of the block forward purchase of electric energy  ii purchase of electric energy from on site generation facilities installed by a third party and iii use of portable generation to avoid peak energy prices 
each of these options is expected to result in increased electric energy prices for customers of scw s bear valley electric division 
we believe that these solutions in whole or in part represent significant savings for customers as compared to reliance on spot purchases in the open market 
we further believe that costs incurred are recoverable from customers 
we cannot give assurance that the cpuc will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs through rates
