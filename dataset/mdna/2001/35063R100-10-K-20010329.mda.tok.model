readers should carefully review the risk factors described in this document as well as in other documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by the company in fiscal year overview foundry designs  develops  manufactures and markets a comprehensive  end to end suite of high performance networking products for enterprises  educational institutions  government agencies  web hosting companies  application service providers asps  electronic banking and finance service providers  and internet service providers 
from our inception in may through december  our operating activities related primarily to developing  building and testing prototype products  building our engineering and manufacturing infrastructure  commencing the staffing of our marketing  sales and technical support organizations  and establishing relationships with customers 
we commenced commercial shipments of our fastiron workgroup layer switch in may  the initial product released in our family of stackable products 
we shipped netiron  our first generation layer switch  in june during the second quarter of  we shipped the first products in our layer serveriron family 
we shipped bigiron  our second generation of midsize and large scale chassis based products  in the third quarter of in may  we began shipping our new product line of high performance internet backbone routers  netiron and netiron we derive our revenue substantially from sales of our stackable and chassis based products  including fees for customer support services related to our products 
foundry s revenue recognition policy follows securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
specifically  foundry recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in general  this results in revenue being recorded at the time of shipment  unless we have future obligations for installation or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until such obligations have been satisfied or customer acceptance has been received 
revenue from customer support services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  generally one year 
at shipment date  foundry establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with its sales 
foundry s warranty period extends months from the date of sale 
in and  foundry recorded a provision for sales returns equal to million and million  respectively  which has been netted against revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
returns related to revenue were insignificant 
this provision is based on our historical returns 
sales to foundry s resellers do not provide for rights of return and the contract with foundry s original equipment manufacturer does not provide for rights of return except in the event foundry s products do not meet specifications or there has been an epidemic failure  as defined in the agreement 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor  manufacturing overhead and warranty costs 
we market and sell our products primarily through a direct sales and marketing organization and  to a lesser extent  through resellers and through our oem co branding relationships with hewlett packard  lucent technologies and utstarcom 
we have sales representatives in the united states  singapore  italy  canada  france  united kingdom  sweden  china  mexico  brazil  netherlands  germany  australia  new zealand  dubai  hong kong  south korea  and taiwan 
we have made significant investments to expand our international operations and expect international revenue to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
we generated net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
although we have been profitable in each quarter since the first quarter of fiscal  our ability to remain profitable depends on our ability to generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
in addition  our results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to factors in our industry and the broad macro economic arena that are outside of our control  including the recent economic downturn 
we received a lower than anticipated amount of product orders in the last few weeks of the fourth quarter of and continue to receive a lower than anticipated amount of product orders for the first quarter of as a result of decreased or delayed capital spending by existing and prospective customers and the slowing us economy 
due to a number of factors which are discussed in more detail below  we expect our selling prices and gross margins to decrease as a result of our increased efforts to compete aggressively and maintain sales levels 
as a result  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in  we also expanded our board of directors 
at a meeting of our board of directors on october   the board approved an amendment to our bylaws increasing our authorized number of directors from three members to seven members and unanimously appointed the following persons to the board alfred j

results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue  net cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss revenue 
net revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of from fiscal to  and from fiscal to these increases were due to the market s increased demand for internet infrastructure equipment  growing acceptance of foundry s product offerings  and a significant increase in foundry s sales and marketing organizations  all of which led to increases in the amount of our equipment sold 
in addition  we introduced our bigiron layer products in the third quarter of  our serveriron layer products in the second quarter of  and our netiron internet routers in the second quarter of these additional product offerings also resulted in increased revenues 
for the year ended december   no customer accounted for greater than of our revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor  manufacturing overhead and warranty costs 
cost of revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  or  and of revenue  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily a result of shifts in product mix and lower manufacturing overhead costs due to increased production volume 
we expect our gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  heightened price competition  component shortages  changes in channels of distribution  product and geographic mix  as well as the mix of configurations within each product group 
downward pressures on our gross margins may be further impacted by increased percentage of revenue from service market providers  international purchasers or through our oems  all of which may have lower margins  or an increase in product costs 
see also risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we expect our gross margin to decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype expenses related to the development of our asics  software development and testing costs  and the depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to the addition of engineering personnel  higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on additional lab equipment 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  promotional expenses and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to significant increases in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions  additional marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products  the expansion of distribution channels  and general corporate branding 
we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to build our field sales and support organizations and expand sales and marketing activities in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities expenses and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an additional provision for doubtful accounts receivable of million to increase our reserve for potential uncollectible accounts due to the impact of the softening economy on our customer base 
in addition  we have added personnel to support the increase in revenue and general corporate expenses consistent with the increased scale of operations 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to build the infrastructure necessary to support the growth of our business 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and a director  we recorded deferred stock compensation in the aggregate amount of million in  million in  and  in  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
this amount is reflected within stockholders equity and is being amortized to operations over the respective vesting periods 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  generally four years from the date of grant 
interest income 
interest income is the net result of the interest earned on the funds we keep on deposit in interest bearing money market and short term investment accounts less any interest expense incurred on our revolving bank line of credit and capital lease obligations 
foundry had net interest income of  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we had cash balances in an interest bearing account resulting from the proceeds of our private financing in march during  interest income increased significantly due to higher cash balances resulting from the proceeds from our initial public offering on october  during  our interest income increased to million as a result of significantly higher cash balances provided by operations and from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
income taxes 
foundry did not provide for state or federal income taxes in fiscal due to operating losses incurred during the year 
a valuation allowance was provided for the entire deferred tax asset as of december  due to the limited operating history of the company  the lack of profitability and the uncertainty of future profitability at that time 
the company generated significant taxable income in and management believes that the company will likely generate sufficient taxable income in the future to ensure the realization of the tax benefits arising from its existing deferred tax assets 
therefore  no valuation allowance was required as of december  and the company s income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
these benefits were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
benefits reducing taxes payable amounted to approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
benefits increasing gross deferred tax assets amounted to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income 
net income increased to million for from million for and from a net loss of million for these increases were the result of significantly higher sales of the company s new product offerings in each of the years  offset by the company s operating expenses which grew at a relatively slower pace compared to our revenue growth 
liquidity and capital resources on october   we completed our initial public offering in which we raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering  foundry financed operations primarily through the private sales of common and preferred stock and  to a lesser extent  from a capital equipment lease line 
at december   foundry had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash equivalents consisted of commercial paper and cash deposited in money market accounts with original maturities of less than three months 
short term investments was comprised of investment grade corporate and us debt securities and commercial paper with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year 
cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash utilized in operating activities was million in the increase from to was due to the income tax benefit realized from exercises of nonqualified stock options and disqualified dispositions of incentive stock options totaling million combined with increased net income offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the cash utilized in was due to net losses  as well as working capital required to fund our growth in operations  including accounts receivable and inventories 
we expect that accounts receivable will continue to increase to the extent our revenue continues to rise 
we also expect that our inventory levels will increase due to new product introductions and increased purchases to secure the supply of certain components 
as a result  such increases will reduce our cash and short term investments 
cash utilized in investing activities was  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the cash utilized in represented purchases of computers and electronic test equipment 
in and we used cash to purchase short term investments and  to a lesser extent  property and equipment 
financing activities in provided million primarily from an equity financing and the exercise of stock options  offset by principal repayments on capital lease obligations 
financing activities in provided million  arising primarily from proceeds from our initial public offering on october  financing activities in provided million primarily from stock option exercises and  to a lesser extent  the collection of stockholder promissory notes 
on september   we entered into a lease for approximately  square feet to serve as our headquarters and manufacturing facility in san jose  california 
our lease commenced on february  and will expire on january  the related rent expense is  per month 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sublease  square feet of office space near our corporate headquarters to accommodate our growth in headcount 
this lease is for a term of twelve months expiring on december  under the terms of the lease  we prepaid rent for the entire lease term totaling million 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures other than those under operating lease agreements 
we expect to incur capital expenditures as we expand our operations in the near future 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  from time to time  we may also consider the acquisition of products and businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investments may require additional capital 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
recently issued accounting standards see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock although we have been profitable since first quarter  we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
we generated net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
we expect to incur increased costs and expenses related to 
sales and marketing  including expansion of our direct sales operation and distribution channels  
product development  
customer support  
expansion of our corporate infrastructure  and 
facilities expansion 
with increased levels of spending  an inability to meet expected revenue levels in a particular quarter could have a material  negative impact on our operating results for that period as we will not be able to react quickly enough to scale back operations 
although we have been profitable in each quarter since the first quarter of fiscal  our ability to remain profitable depends on our ability to generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we may not meet quarterly financial expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
delays in generating or recognizing forecasted revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
therefore  we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may negatively affect our operating results 
our reseller agreements typically provide that the reseller may delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
further  our customer purchase orders and reseller agreements sometimes provide that the customer or reseller may cancel orders within specified time frames without significant penalty 
we also plan to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing efforts  expand our customer support capabilities  finance increased levels of research and development and build our operational and administrative infrastructure 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  any shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could cause a significant decline in our quarterly operating results 
although our customer base has increased substantially  we still depend on large  recurring purchases from certain customers  and any loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could cause a shortfall in revenue 
prior to fiscal  a limited number of customers and resellers accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the fourth quarter and year ended december   no customers accounted for greater than of our net revenue 
this may not necessarily be indicative of future customer concentrations 
although our customer base has become less concentrated  the loss of continued orders from our more significant customers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
for example  in  sales to hewlett packard and america online accounted for and of revenues  respectively 
while our financial performance may depend on large  recurring orders from certain customers and resellers  we do not have binding commitments from any of them 
for example 
our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  
our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time  
our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements  and 
our reseller agreements provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a small number of customers 
financial results for any particular period will not predict results for future periods 
because of the uncertain nature of the rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  you should not rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
in the future  our revenue may grow at a slower rate or not at all and on a quarter to quarter basis may be significantly lower than our historical quarterly growth rate 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
we currently expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase significantly as we expand our sales and marketing operations and continue to develop new products 
further  we are subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their non qualified stock options 
the employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee s gain  which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material depending on the number of stock options exercised and the fair market value of our common stock during such period 
these employer payroll taxes would be recorded as a charge to operations in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees 
in addition to the net proceeds we would receive upon the exercise of stock options  we would receive tax deductions for gains realized by employees on the exercise of non qualified stock options for which the benefit is recorded as additional paid in capital 
however  because we are unable to predict our future stock price and the number of optionees who may exercise during any particular period  we cannot predict what  if any  expense will be recorded in a future period and the impact on our future financial results 
intense competition in the market for network solutions could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the market for network solutions is intensely competitive 
in particular  cisco systems inc maintains a dominant position in this market and several of its products compete directly with our products 
we also compete with other large public companies  such as nortel networks  lucent technologies  juniper networks and extreme networks as well as other smaller public and private companies 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater market leverage  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  more name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
additionally  we may face competition from unknown companies and emerging technologies that may offer new lan  man and lan wan solutions to enterprises and isps 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic relationships that would enable them to offer  or bring to market earlier  products that are superior to ours in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
in order to remain competitive  we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products with superior performance at lower prices than our competitors 
we must also enhance our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenue and profitability could suffer 
our ability to increase our revenue depends on expanding our north american direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels and continuing to provide excellent customer support 
if we are unable to effectively expand  train and retain our domestic sales and support staff or establish our indirect distribution channels  our ability to grow and increase revenue could be harmed 
our expansion of our direct sales operation may not be successfully completed and the cost of our expansion may exceed the revenue generated 
if we are unable to develop relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results would suffer 
we need to increase our customer service and support staff to support new and existing customers and resellers 
the design and installation of networking products can be complex and our customers  particularly our isp customers  require a high level of sophisticated support and services 
hiring highly trained customer service and support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
we must continue to introduce new products with superior performance in a timely manner in order to sustain and increase our revenue 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce new products in a timely manner that offer substantially greater performance and support a greater number of users per device  all at lower price points 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
during the development of our products  we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
in addition  when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
we sell to internet service providers  whose unpredictable demands  requirements and business models subject us to potential adverse revenue fluctuations 
we have introduced products specifically targeted at the isp market and currently have under development other products to address their requirements 
as a result  our success depends on increased sales to isps 
we believe that there are a number of risks arising from doing business with isps which may not arise in our relationships with our other customers  including 
isps demonstrate a low level of brand loyalty and may switch to another supplier which provides superior performance  
any failure of an isp s service to its customers  particularly in the case of our largest isp customer  america online  that is correctly or incorrectly attributed to our products could lead to substantial negative publicity and undermine our efforts to increase our sales in both this market and other markets  
we may lose isp customers if they fail due to the highly competitive nature of their business or if they do not survive as a result of mergers and acquisitions in the isp industry  and 
if the internet does not continue to expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial marketplace  the growth of the market for internet infrastructure equipment may not continue and the demand for our products could decline 
due to these factors  we may not successfully increase our penetration of the isp market or maintain our current level of sales in this market 
our revenue may be adversely affected by a reduction in outside financing made available to many of our customers 
our customer base includes emerging enterprise  telecommunications and internet companies who rely on venture capital firms and other similar financing sources to fund their operations and growth 
many of these customers are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain such financing on attractive terms  if at all 
if these companies are unable to raise adequate capital  they may significantly reduce or even cease their purchases of our products or may be unable to pay or delay payment for products they had previously purchased 
such reductions in spending or payment defaults could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
some of our revenue may be derived through vendor financing programs which may be difficult to administer and may expose us to increased credit risks 
our existing and potential customers may increasingly demand vendor financing programs through which they can finance their purchase of networking equipment 
we currently have one such program in place  but only on a limited basis 
several of our large competitors  in contrast  currently offer vendor financing programs on a broad basis 
in the future we may also offer them on a broad basis in order to meet increased demand and remain competitive 
although vendor financing programs can increase customer opportunities  they can also be difficult and costly to administer and may be utilized by customers who carry heightened credit risk 
if we are unable to effectively administer vendor financing programs on a broad basis  or if we incur material losses due to customer defaults under the programs  our business could be harmed which could cause our stock price to decline 
hewlett packard is a major customer and our most significant oem  and our business could be harmed if our relationship with hewlett packard is terminated 
hewlett packard  currently our most significant oem  accounted for approximately of our revenue in and of our revenue in we anticipate that it will continue to be a major customer 
in addition to providing revenue through sales of our products to hewlett packard  we believe that this relationship is important to facilitate broad market acceptance of our products and enhance our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
therefore  in addition to directly affecting our revenue  the cancellation of our agreement with hewlett packard could harm our ability to market and sell our products to potential customers 
in addition  if we were to default under conditions specified in the agreement  hewlett packard could use our source code to develop and manufacture competing products 
this could harm our performance and ability to compete 
this agreement creates the potential that we and hewlett packard may compete for sales to the same customer 
if this situation occurs  it could harm our relationship with hewlett packard and also harm our business 
we expect our gross margin to decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
our industry has experienced rapid erosion of average product selling prices due to a number of factors  particularly competitive pressures and rapid technological change 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in response to competitive pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
both we and our competitors sometimes lower sales prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
furthermore  with the recent disruption in the technology sector coupled with more broad macro economic factors  both we and our competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain sales levels 
such intense pricing competition could cause our gross margins to decline and may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our gross margins may be further affected if we are unable to reduce costs and effectively manage our inventory levels 
additionally  our gross margins may be affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs  the mix of product configurations sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
for example  we generally realize higher gross margins on direct sales to the end user than on sales through resellers or our oems 
as a result  any significant shift in revenue through resellers or our oems could harm our gross margins 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
if we are unable to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly engineers 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have received one claim like this from another company and we may receive additional claims in the future 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against any such claims  regardless of the merits of such claims 
our success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success depends on bobby r 
johnson  jr  president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our personnel 
our expansion in international markets will involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
as a result  our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully address these risks 
our success will depend  in part  on increasing international sales and expanding our international operations 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  including pan dacom and total network solutions in europe  mitsui in japan  bell canada in canada and samsung in korea 
although we expect international revenue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue  the failure of our resellers to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in particular  our revenue from international sales depends on mitsui s ability to sell our products and on the strength of the japanese economy which has been weak in recent years 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including 
potential recessions in economies outside the united states  
longer accounts receivable collection cycles  
seasonal reductions in business activity  
higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  
difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  
difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  
political instability and export restrictions  
potential adverse tax consequences  and 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
one or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations and  consequently  on its business  operating results and financial condition 
generally  our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive on a price basis in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources  if these components are not available  our revenues may be harmed 
we currently purchase several key components used in our products from single or limited sources and depend on supply from these sources to meet our needs 
our principal suppliers of key components include celestica  texas instruments  sanmina  finisar  hewlett packard  intel  fujitsu and samsung 
our principal limited sourced components include dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  asics  printed circuit boards  optical components and microprocessors 
we acquire these components through purchase orders and have no long term commitments regarding supply or price from these suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages in allocations of components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we may encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future which could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
we depend on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for single or limited sourced materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
if orders do not match forecasts or if we do not manage inventory effectively  we may have either excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we currently subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to two companies located in san jose  california 
celestica assembles and tests our printed circuit boards  and sanmina corporation assembles and tests our backplane products 
we do not have long term contracts with either of these manufacturers 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our contract manufacturers  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we attempt to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  the loss of either of our contract manufacturers  or the ability to obtain raw materials  could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of our products  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and may cause us to miss our revenue expectations 
some of our products have a relatively high sales price  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by an enterprise or internet service provider 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle in these situations can be as long as months and may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may not meet our revenue expectations 
the timing of the adoption of industry standards may negatively impact widespread market acceptance of our products 
our success depends in part on both the adoption of industry standards for new technologies in our market and our products compliance with industry standards 
many technological developments occur prior to the adoption of the related industry standard 
the absence of an industry standard related to a specific technology may prevent market acceptance of products using the technology 
for example  we introduced gigabit ethernet products in may  over a year prior to the adoption of the industry standard for this technology 
we intend to develop products using other technological advancements  such as gigabit ethernet  and may develop these products prior to the adoption of industry standards related to these technologies 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
further  we may develop products that do not comply with the eventual industry standard  which could hurt our ability to sell these products 
if the industry evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion that meet these new standards 
even after industry standards are adopted  the future success of our products depends upon widespread market acceptance of their underlying technologies 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new enhancements and versions are released 
despite our testing procedures  these defects and errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendors products could result in 
negative customer reactions  
product liability claims  
negative publicity regarding us and our products  
delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  
product returns  
lost sales  and 
unexpected expenses to remedy errors 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  our business will be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth which has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
our revenue increased significantly during and our headcount increased from to employees 
our management team has relatively limited experience managing rapidly growing companies 
as a result  we may make mistakes in operating our business  such as inaccurately forecasting our sales  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
to accommodate anticipated growth  we must 
improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  
hire  train and manage additional qualified personnel  including in the near future  a significant number of new sales personnel  and 
effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties 
our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
in october  we began implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system to meet the increasing needs associated with the growth of our operations 
as our international operations grow  we will need to expand our support and communications infrastructure overseas as well 
any delay in the implementation of or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our products may not meet the legal foreign and international standards required for their sale  which will harm our business 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as with recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
although our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries we currently sell to  there is no assurance that our existing and future product offerings will continue to comply with evolving standards and regulations 
if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or maintaining profitability 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could result in the dilution of our stockholders  cause us to incur substantial expenses and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
as part of our business strategy  we may review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities 
future acquisitions by us could result in large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could negatively affect our results of operations 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including 
difficulties in the assimilation of products  operations  personnel and technologies of the acquired companies  
diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  
risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and 
potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
although we do not currently have any agreements or plans with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we may need to raise more capital  but the availability of additional financing is uncertain 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash from future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock 
the terms of debt securities could impose restrictions on our operations and could cause our stock price to decline 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and know how 
we do not own any patents although we do have patent applications pending 
we may not have taken actions that adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we provide software to customers under license agreements included in the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  some companies in the networking markets have extensive patent portfolios with respect to networking technology 
we do not currently own any patents  although we have patent applications pending 
from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to us 
such third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products 
in fiscal  we received letters from both ibm and nortel alleging that certain of our products that operate on industry standards may infringe one or more of their patents 
in march  nortel filed a lawsuit against foundry in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that certain of the company s products infringe several of nortel s patents and seeking injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages 
we are currently analyzing the validity of these claims and exploring potential courses of action 
regardless of the merit of these claims  our investigation could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical management personnel  or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements 
if there is a successful claim of infringement by any third party  or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
our stock price has been volatile historically  which may make it more difficult for you to resell shares when you want at prices you find attractive 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
during the year  the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market taking into consideration any stock splits ranged from to 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
additionally  volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the class action lawsuits pending against us as indicated in item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
management beneficially owns approximately of our stock  their interests could conflict with yours  significant sales of stock held by them could have a negative effect on foundry s stock price 
foundry s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result of their ownership and positions  our directors and executive officers collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of foundry 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by foundry and its directors and executive officers  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of foundry common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of foundry without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of foundry  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  other catastrophic event  or power shortages 
our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  our headquarters are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in recent months  the western united states and california in particular has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the forseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foundry s investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or fund 
with the exception of a high risk million investment made in a development stage private company  who is also our customer  in february  our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with original maturities of less than one year and with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
a hypothetical basis point decline in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized earnings on our million of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  by approximately million 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
currently  all of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of canada  and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures
