item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview synaptic pharmaceutical corporation synaptic or the company is a drug discovery company utilizing g protein coupled receptors gpcrs as targets for novel therapeutics 
the company is utilizing its large portfolio of patented gpcr targets as a basis for the creation of improved drugs that act through these targets 
the company and its licensees are first utilizing these receptor targets to discover their function in the body and thus specific physiological disorders with which they may be associated  and secondly  to design compounds that can potentially be developed as drugs 
the company is currently collaborating with grunenthal gmbh grunenthal and kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
kissei 
concurrently with the establishment of the collaborative arrangement  synaptic granted grunenthal a license to certain of its technology and patent rights 
in addition to its ongoing collaborative arrangements  other pharmaceutical companies have licenses to certain of our technology and patent rights 
for convenience of reference  the agreements pursuant to which the licenses referred to in this paragraph and the preceding paragraph have been granted are collectively referred to as the license agreements 
since inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through the sale of its stock  through contract and license revenue under certain of its license agreements  and through interest income and capital gains resulting from its investments 
we also have received monies through government grants under the small business innovative research sbir program of the national institutes of health and through the sale of a portion of new jersey state net operating losses carryforwards 
under the license agreements  the company may receive one or more of the following types of revenue license revenue  contract revenue  royalty revenue or revenue from the sales of drugs 
license revenue represents non refundable payments for a license to one or more of our patents and or a license to our technology 
payments for licenses are recognized as they are received or  if earlier  when they become guaranteed  provided they are independent of any continuing research activity  otherwise  they are recognized pro rata during the term of the related research agreement in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
contract revenue includes research funding to support a specified number of synaptic s scientists and payments upon the achievement of specified research and development milestones 
research funding revenue is recognized ratably over the period of the collaboration to which it relates and is based upon predetermined funding requirements 
research and development milestone payment revenue is recognized when the related research or development milestone is achieved 
under each of the license agreements other than the grunenthal agreement  we are entitled to receive royalty payments based upon the sales of drugs that may be developed using our technology or that may be covered by our patents 
under the grunenthal agreement  synaptic has development and marketing rights in certain geographical areas with respect to drugs  if any  that are jointly identified as part of the collaboration with grunenthal 
accordingly  we may receive revenue from sales in our geographical areas as defined of drugs if we market them independently  or we may receive royalty payments if we license our marketing rights to a third party 
to date  we have not received either royalty revenue or revenue from the sales of drugs and we do not expect to receive such revenues for a number of years  if at all 
to date  the company s expenditures have been for research and development related expenses  general and administrative related expenses  fixed asset purchases and various patent related expenditures incurred in protecting our technologies 
synaptic has been historically unprofitable and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for a number of years and may not become profitable  unless and until we receive royalty revenue or revenue from sales of drugs that may be developed with the use of our technology or patent rights 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and revenues 
the company recognized revenue of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  from to was attributable to an increase in license revenue of  resulting primarily from the grant of a non exclusive license to certain of synaptic s technology and patent rights  offset by a reduction in contract revenue of  resulting from the net reduction in the number of scientists being funded under collaborative arrangements 
the decrease of  from to was attributable primarily to the following a net decrease in contract revenue of  resulting from the contractual termination of three of our collaborative arrangements and the receipt in of  of non recurring license revenue under the glaxo agreement 
research and development expenses 
the company incurred research and development expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  from to was attributable primarily to a net decrease in headcount and a corresponding decrease in supplies which were partially offset by an increase in preclinical testing costs 
the decrease of  or  from to was attributable primarily to a reduction in compensation and fringe benefit expenses due to a net decrease in headcount as well as corresponding reductions in travel and supply costs  which were partially offset by increased rent expense for facilities resulting from previously contracted increases in square footage 
general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred general and administrative expenses of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to the following an increase in rent expense  an increase in consulting and finder s fees associated with business development activities  and an increase in legal and patent costs 
the increase of  or  from to was attributable primarily to increases in rent expense resulting from previously contracted increases in square footage and compensation and fringe benefit expenses 
other income  net 
the company recorded other income of   and  for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease of  from to in other income was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during as a result of the utilization of these resources to fund synaptic s operations 
the decrease of  from to in other income was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances during income tax benefit 
in november  the company recognized  from the sale of a portion of its state net operating loss carryforwards 
net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share 
the net loss incurred by the company was  per share   per share and  per share for the fiscal years of  and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss per share of resulted primarily from higher revenues and an income tax benefit  which were partially offset by higher total operating expenses and lower other income during the year ended december   as described above 
the increase in net loss per share of from to resulted primarily from the recognition of lower total revenue and of higher total expenses 
operating trends 
revenues may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors including the timing of revenue earned under the license agreements and revenue that may be earned under future collaborative and or license agreements 
synaptic will recognize revenue under its research and licensing agreement with kissei pharmaceutical co  ltd 
during and expects to recognize additional revenues under this agreement during under the terms of certain of the license agreements  revenues may be recognized if certain milestones are achieved 
we continue to assess the opportunity for obtaining additional funding under new collaborative and or license agreements as well as obtaining financing through equity transactions 
we continue to monitor our spending level in order to insure that we have enough cash to last through the year preclinical expenses are expected to increase as synaptic moves its own drug discovery projects forward 
legal expenses are expected to increase as a result of a suit filed by the company 
see legal proceedings in part i  item  hereof 
other income  net is expected to decline in and as existing funds are utilized to support the company s operations 
this decline will be partially offset by rental income that we expect to recognize under our sublease agreements 
the company is pursuing further sales of its state net operating loss nol carryforwards and its state research and development credits under the state of new jersey s technology business tax certificate transfer program the program 
no assurance can be given  however  as to the amount of nol carryforwards that may be sold under the program in any one year 
external factors that may have an effect on future nol sales are such items as limitations imposed by state law  the availability of buyers and related demand 
property and equipment spending may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the number of collaborations in which we are involved at any given time and replacement due to normal wear and obsolescence 
equipment spending in is expected to increase from that of at december   synaptic held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of  synaptic s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of the marketable securities held by synaptic are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about marketable securities held by synaptic at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated rate fair by expected maturity value s total s principal      weighted average stated rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which synaptic currently holds since we have purchased some marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of current holdings  affecting both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  the company places some of its cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in money market funds 
these fluctuations can have an impact on future cash interest streams and future earnings of the company  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregated  and  respectively 
this decrease was a result of the utilization of these resources to fund the company s operations 
to date  synaptic has met its cash requirements through the sale of its stock  through contract and license revenue  through interest income and gains resulting from its investments  through sbir grants and through the sale of a portion of its state nol carryforwards 
if the current biotechnology financing environment remains unfavorable  raising additional capital may be difficult 
synaptic leases laboratory and office facilities under an agreement expiring on december  the minimum annual payment under the lease is currently  the lease provides for fixed escalations in rent payments in the years and at december   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the company currently intends to utilize these funds primarily to conduct certain of its research programs  for patent related expenditures  for general corporate purposes  to make leasehold improvements to its facilities and to purchase property and equipment 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses for a number of years 
we believe that cash on hand and cash that we expect to receive through interest payments on investments  will be sufficient to fund operations  as well as our share of certain development costs under the grunenthal agreement  through the year as of december   the company had nol carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes that will expire principally in the years through in addition  the company had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  which will expire principally in through also at december   synaptic had nol carryforwards of approximately  for state income tax purposes and state research and development credit carryforwards of  for financial reporting purposes  a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to these carryforwards 
due to the limitations imposed by the tax reform act of  and as a result of significant changes in the company s ownership in and  the utilization of  of federal nol carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
the utilization of the research and development credits is similarly limited 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  as we do not currently intend to engage in derivatives or in hedging transactions  we do not anticipate any effect on synaptic s results of operations  financial position or cash flows upon the adoption of sfas disclosure regarding forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those relating to future cash and spending plans  amounts of future research funding  patent related plans  additional drug discovery programs  the effectiveness  efficacy  or other results of any of synaptic s technology or drugs  any other statements regarding future growth  future cash needs  future operations  business plans and financial results  and any other statements which are not historical facts 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  estimate  expect  may  project  and similar expressions are intended to be among the statements that identify forward looking statements 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those risks and uncertainties relating to those described below  as well as other factors detailed elsewhere in this report  including in item of this report under the captions patents  proprietary technology and trade secrets  competition and government regulation cautionary statements 
these cautionary statements qualify the forward looking statements included in this report 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to synaptic or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
early stage of product development  technological uncertainty since its inception in january  synaptic has focused its activities on the discovery and cloning of receptor genes and the use of these genes as tools in the design of precisely targeted compounds for a broad range of therapeutic applications 
to date  neither synaptic nor any of its collaborative partners or any of its other licensees has completed the development of drugs designed with the use of company technology and we do not expect that any drugs resulting from our or our collaborative partners or other licensees research and development efforts will be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
all compounds discovered by synaptic and its collaborative partners and other licensees will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
extensive preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy will take several years  and the time required to commercialize new drugs cannot be predicted with accuracy 
moreover  potential products that appear to be promising at early stages of development may never reach the market for a number of reasons 
these reasons include  but are not limited to  the possibilities that potential products are found during preclinical testing or clinical trials to be ineffective or to cause harmful side effects  that they fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  that they are difficult or uneconomical to manufacture on a large scale  that they fail to achieve market acceptance or that they are precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that the company s approach to drug discovery  its research and development efforts or the efforts of grunenthal  kissei  lilly  novartis or glaxo  or any future collaborative partner or other licensee of the company  will result in the development of any drugs  or that any drugs  if successfully developed  will be proven to be safe and effective in clinical trials  receive required regulatory approvals  be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or be successfully commercialized 
product development of new pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain  and unanticipated developments  including clinical or regulatory delays  unexpected adverse effects and inadequate therapeutic efficacy  would slow or prevent product development efforts of the company and its collaborative partners and other licensees and have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
dependence on collaborative partners and licensees for development  regulatory approvals  manufacturing  marketing and other resources a key element of synaptic s business strategy is to leverage resources by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies 
under the agreements with kissei  lilly and novartis  the company s collaborative partners and licensees are each responsible for conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology  obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and commercializing any resulting drugs 
under the grunenthal agreement  grunenthal is responsible for conducting certain preclinical testing and clinical trials of compounds developed through the use of the company s technology 
synaptic has no involvement in the research and development activities of glaxo under the glaxo agreement 
as a result  the company s receipt of revenues whether in the form of drug development milestones  royalties on sales or net sales proceeds in respect of drugs resulting from its collaborative and licensing arrangements is dependent upon the activities of its collaborative partners and other licensees 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborative partners and other licensees to the development of drugs that would be subject to royalties payable to synaptic are not within our control 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the interests of synaptic will continue to coincide with those of its collaborative partners or other licensees  that one or more of synaptic s collaborative partners or other licensees will not develop independently or with third parties drugs that could compete with drugs of the types covered by their arrangements with synaptic  or that disagreements over rights or technology or other proprietary interests will not occur 
if any of synaptic s collaborative partners or other licensees breaches its agreement with the company  or fails to devote adequate resources to or conduct in a timely manner its collaborative or licensed activities  the related research programs or the development and commercialization of drug candidates subject to such arrangement could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s collaborative or licensing arrangements will be successful 
further  there can be no assurance that synaptic will be able to enter into acceptable collaborative or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies in the future  or that  if negotiated  such arrangements will be successful 
history of operating losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception in january at december   synaptic s accumulated deficit was  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with the company s research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with operations 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses at least over the next several years and expect losses to increase as research funding under collaborative arrangements diminish 
as of december   the only revenues generated by the company had resulted from payments under collaborative and license agreements  and government grants under the sbir program of the national institutes of health 
the company s revenues  expenses and losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research payments under the novartis agreements expired in  research payments under the merck agreement expired in february  and research payments under the lilly agreement expired in july we anticipate that there will initially be little  if any  biological knowledge regarding many of synaptic s future gene discoveries and  as a result  synaptic may have fewer opportunities to enter into collaborative arrangements focused on these discoveries 
we do not expect to achieve revenues or royalties from sales of drugs for a number of years  if at all 
the company will not achieve revenues or royalties from drug sales unless it or one of its collaborative partners or other licensees successfully completes clinical trials with respect to a drug candidate  obtains regulatory approvals for that drug candidate and commercializes the resulting drug 
failure to achieve significant revenue or profitable operations could impair the company s ability to sustain operations and there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding the operation of synaptic s business requires substantial capital resources and this requirement is likely to increase in the future 
the company s future financial requirements will depend on many factors  including the continued progress of its research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  if any  of its or its collaborative partners or other licensees drug candidates  the timing of regulatory approvals  if any  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its or its collaborative partners or other licensees proposed products and the status of competitive products 
synaptic s capital requirements will also depend on its ability to establish and maintain collaborative or licensing arrangements with others and on whether its future collaborative partners provide research funding and are responsible for all development activities  preclinical testing and regulatory approvals and  if these approvals are obtained  the manufacturing and marketing of products 
in addition  these capital requirements will depend on the time and expense associated with filing and  if necessary  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims 
the company entered into the grunenthal agreement in january under this agreement  synaptic will retain certain ownership rights to products that result from the collaboration 
in addition  synaptic will be significantly involved in the development of any potential products but may also be required to contribute substantial financial resources towards such development 
accordingly  the cost to synaptic of this arrangement may be significantly greater than the cost to it of participating in a royalty based collaboration 
no assurance can be given that the company s existing cash on hand and marketable securities and funds it will receive under its collaborative and license agreements  together with interest income  will be sufficient 
we expect that synaptic will  in the future  seek to raise additional funding from other sources  including other collaborative partners and licensees  and through public or private financings  including sales of equity or debt securities 
any collaborative or licensing arrangement could result in limitations on the company s ability to control the research and development of potential drugs and the commercialization of resulting drugs  if any  as well as its profits therefrom 
any equity financing could result in dilution to synaptic s then existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on favorable terms or at all  or that these funds  if raised  would be sufficient to permit the company to continue to conduct its operations 
if adequate funds are not available  synaptic may be required to curtail significantly or eliminate one or more of its receptor or drug discovery programs 
uncertainties related to clinical trials before obtaining required regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development  the company or its collaborators and other licensees must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that such product is safe and efficacious for use 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results that will be obtained from large scale clinical trials  and there can be no assurance that clinical trials of any product under development will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product or will result in a marketable product 
the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product under development by synaptic or its collaborative partners or other licensees must be supported by extensive data from clinical trials 
a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory agency may require additional clinical trials  which could result in increased costs and significant development delays 
the rate of completion of clinical trials of the company s or its collaborative partners and other licensees products is dependent upon  among other factors  obtaining adequate clinical supplies and the rate of patient accrual 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in planned patient enrollment in clinical trials may result in increased costs  program delays or both  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  synaptic s collaborative partners and other licensees generally have the right to control the planning and execution of product development and clinical programs  and there can be no assurance that partners and licensees will conduct programs in accordance with schedules that are satisfactory to the company 
there can be no assurance that  if clinical trials are completed  synaptic or its collaborative partners and other licensees will submit ndas with respect to any potential products or that any application will be reviewed and approved by the fda in a timely manner  if at all 
lack of manufacturing experience  reliance on contract manufacturers the company currently has no manufacturing facilities and relies on its collaborative partners and other licensees or other manufacturers to produce its compounds for research and development  preclinical and clinical purposes 
the products under development by synaptic and its collaborative partners and other licensees have never been manufactured on a commercial scale and there can be no assurance that products can be manufactured at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
if synaptic were unable to contract for a sufficient supply of its compounds on acceptable terms  or if it should encounter delays or difficulties in its relationships with manufacturers  any preclinical or clinical testing schedule of the company would be delayed  resulting in delay in the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  manufacturers that synaptic may use must adhere to current gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if these facilities cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda pre market approval of the products will not be granted 
lack of sales and marketing capability the creation of infrastructure to commercialize pharmaceutical products is a difficult  expensive and time consuming process 
synaptic currently has no sales or marketing capability 
to market directly any product it may develop  the company would need to establish a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and distribution capability or contract with other pharmaceutical and or health care companies with distribution systems and direct sales forces 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to establish direct or indirect sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance for licensing arrangements 
to the extent that the company enters into co promotion or licensing arrangements  any revenues received by the company will be dependent on the efforts of third parties  and there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent on its management and scientific staff 
loss of the services of any key individual could have an adverse effect on the company 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly talented managerial  scientific  software and bioinformatics personnel and consultants 
synaptic faces intense competition for personnel from  among others  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to attract and retain the personnel it requires on acceptable terms 
failure to attract and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
external environment over the past several years  there has been a significant reduction in the number of investors who are willing to commit capital to the biotechnology industry 
with over public biotechnology companies and over  private biotechnology companies  the lack of capital is severely impairing the ability of many of these companies to carry out their research 
additionally  many pharmaceutical companies are now routinely performing many of the types of research and services that have historically been performed by biotechnology companies 
as a consequence  many pharmaceutical companies are less interested than in the past both in engaging in collaborations with biotechnology companies in a number of areas and in providing them with research funding and other sources of revenue 
over time  synaptic could be materially and adversely affected by a lack of available capital and or a lack of interest on the part of the pharmaceutical industry in its services or products 
this unfavorable external environment could result in the company s inability to complete certain of its research projects and or in the need for synaptic to downsize until it begins to receive royalty income pursuant to outstanding licensing arrangements
