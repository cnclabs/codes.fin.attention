after a management review of the company s operations  it was determined that this territory could be operated more efficiently by another coca cola bottler due primarily to geographic proximity to the customers 
without the requirement to service this territory  the company was able to reorganize operations in its west virginia territory to further improve efficiencies 
management believes that the combination of the proceeds from the sale and the efficiencies gained will lead to higher profitability and better returns in this part of our bottling territory

however  net selling prices had not increased  even at the rate of inflation 
during  the company was faced with significant cost increases for concentrate  certain packaging materials and fuel 
additionally  marketing support the company had historically received from the coca cola company was adjusted downward significantly and interest rates on the company s floating rate debt increased 
in the face of the aforementioned cost increases  the company raised its net selling prices during the year by approximately over as with most consumer products  increases in selling prices temporarily dampened sales demand 
the increase in prices was the primary driver behind a decline in unit sales volume of approximately for the year on a constant territory basis 
unit sales volume declined through the first three quarters of however  volume increased by during the fourth quarter of the year 
higher net selling prices more than offset volume declines and resulted in an increase in net sales of in to million

after several years of significant capital spending  the company was well positioned in with a strong infrastructure to support the business 
the investment in infrastructure in prior years allowed the company to significantly reduce capital spending in to million from over million in  which included approximately million for the purchase of equipment that was previously leased 
the company anticipates capital spending to be lower in than it was in the late s 
as a result of increased cash flow from operations  reduced capital spending and the sale of bottling territory in kentucky and ohio  the company reduced its long term debt by approximately million during the company continues to focus on its key long term objectives including increasing per capita consumption  operating cash flow and stockholder value 
we believe we will be able to achieve these objectives over the long term because of superior products  a solid relationship with our strategic partner  the coca cola company  select acquisitions  an experienced management team and a work force of approximately  talented individuals working together as a team

soft drink industry growth levels slowed significantly during and the company s higher cost structure negatively impacted earnings 
the company reduced its workforce by approximately in the fourth quarter of to reduce staffing costs

forward looking statements this annual report on form k  as well as information included in  or incorporated by reference from  future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission and information contained in written material  press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of the company  contains  or may contain several forward looking management comments and other statements that reflect management s current outlook for future periods 
these statements include  among others  statements relating to our expectations concerning increasing long term stockholder value  per capita consumption and operating cash flow  the sufficiency of our financial resources to fund our operations  our expectations concerning marketing support payments from the coca cola company and other beverage companies  our expectations about higher profitability and better returns in our west virginia territory  our expectations about interest expense  our acquisition strategy and our capital expenditure requirements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
borrowings under lines of credit and other variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates decline and the fair market value of the company s debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is generally managed by borrowing funds with a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to effectively change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
the company generally maintains between and of total borrowings at variable interest rates after taking into account all of the interest rate hedging activities 
while this is the target range  the financial position of the company and market conditions may result in strategies outside of this range at certain points in time 
as it relates to the company s variable rate debt  if market interest rates average more in than the rates of december   interest expense for would increase by million 
if market interest rates had averaged more in than the rates at january   interest expense for would have increased by million 
these amounts were determined by calculating the effect of the hypothetical interest rate on our variable rate debt after giving consideration to all our interest rate hedging activities 
this sensitivity analysis assumes that there are no changes in the company s financial structure 
the company is subject to commodity price risk arising from price movements for certain commodities included as part of its raw materials 
the company generally manages this risk by entering into long term contracts with adjustable prices 
the company has not used derivative commodity instruments in the management of this risk
