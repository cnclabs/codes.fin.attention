factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   the company had clinics in operation  of which opened in management s goal for is to open between and additional clinics 
the opening of these clinics is subject to  among other things  the company s ability to identify suitable geographic locations and physical therapy clinic partners 
the company s operating results will be adversely impacted by initial operating losses from the new clinics 
during the initial period of operation  operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics due to the start up costs of newly opened clinics including  without limitation  salaries and related costs of the physical therapist and other clinic personnel  rent and equipment and other supplies required to open the clinic and the fact that patient revenues tend to be lower in the first year of a new clinic s operation and increase significantly over the subsequent two to three years 
based on historical performance of the company s new clinics  the clinics opened in should favorably impact the company s results of operations for and beyond
