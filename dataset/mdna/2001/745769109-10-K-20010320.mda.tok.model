the amount item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of the additional payment  if any  would equal x the product of i the amount by which the transaction proceeds as defined herein exceeds the imputed value as defined herein multiplied by ii the applicable percentage ie  percent for the period from may  through may  multiplied by iii the number of shares of old pulitzer common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of old pulitzer class b common stock owned by the selling stockholders  adjusted for  among other things  stock dividends and stock splits  less y the sum of any additional payments previously received by the selling stockholders  provided  however  that in the event of any recapitalization  dividend or distribution  the amount by which the transaction proceeds exceeds the imputed value shall not exceed the amount paid or distributed pursuant to such recapitalization  dividend or distribution in respect of one share of old pulitzer common stock 
the term transaction proceeds was defined to mean  in the case of a merger  the aggregate fair market value as defined herein of the consideration received pursuant thereto by the holder of one share of old pulitzer common stock  and  in the case of a recapitalization  dividend or distribution  the aggregate fair market value of the amounts paid or distributed in respect of one share of old pulitzer common stock plus the aggregate fair market value of one share of old pulitzer common stock following such transaction
