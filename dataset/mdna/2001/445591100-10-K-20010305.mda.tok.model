restructuring plans and related matters in october  the company s board of directors approved and the company initiated a comprehensive reorganization and restructuring plan the restructuring plan 
the major components of this plan include with principal emphasis on the company s graphics products business creating manufacturing centers of excellence  outsourcing the company s european distribution activities and consolidating its u 
s 
distribution activities  and focusing its product offering and marketing efforts 
the company recorded restructuring charges relating to this plan totaling million pre tax 
per share in the fiscal fourth quarter 
note all earnings per share amounts included in management s discussion and analysis are presented on an after tax  diluted basis 
these fiscal restructuring charges are classified as restructuring and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the restructuring charges include employee severance costs million  recognition of future lease obligations million  fixed asset writedowns million  and other related costs 
in addition to such restructuring charges  the company expects to spend approximately million pre tax for implementation costs of this plan to be recorded as period costs as incurred  of which million pre tax 
per share was recorded in fiscal and 
million pre tax 
per share is expected to be spent in fiscal the total estimated implementation costs of million are approximately million higher than originally anticipated  primarily as a result of higher than expected manufacturing and operating costs million consisting mainly of air freight costs of transporting products from the company s european operations for sale in the us  outsourcing costs of some converting operations  inventory losses incurred from plant shutdown  and higher material product substitution costs 
management believes that these additional expenditures were appropriate in order to protect the company s service levels and customer base in the face of higher demand for certain of its products in the us and europe 
the other implementation costs in fiscal included employee retention bonuses  severance  outplacement  relocation and training costs million  project consulting 
million  plant rearrangement and moving costs 
million  and other costs and are included in the following categories in the accompanying consolidated statements of income cost of sales million and selling  general and administrative expenses million 
the company has completed the consolidation of its manufacturing operations and distribution activities in the us and the outsourcing of its european distribution activities 
in addition  the company has substantially completed its plan to consolidate its european manufacturing operations and expects completion by early fiscal approximately million remains accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  this accrual relates largely to severance with the expectation that all spending will be substantially completed by the end of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
creating manufacturing centers of excellence is expected to result in consolidated manufacturing operations in both the us and europe 
these actions are intended to eliminate redundancies and reduce fixed costs 
the outsourcing and consolidation of some of the company s distribution activities are expected to improve customer service  utilize space more efficiently  and reduce capital investment and operating costs 
the company s focus on its product offering and marketing efforts also is expected to reduce operating costs  improve margins and inventory turns  and ultimately provide the foundation for further sales growth of the company s graphics products business 
these actions resulted in the elimination of approximately positions during fiscal and the company realized pre tax cost savings from the restructuring plan of approximately million 
per share during fiscal  and such pre tax cost savings are expected to increase to million in fiscal and million per year thereafter 
although the company expects to realize such future cost savings  there can be no assurance that they will be achieved 
in april  the company initiated a new strategy for growth and restructuring the strategic plan designed to restore higher levels of sales growth and profitability and to reduce its cost structure 
the key initiatives of the strategic plan were focused on significant reduction of the company s stock keeping units  rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities  and a major restructuring of its administrative and marketing and selling functions 
the company has completed the implementation of its strategic plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company reduced by 
million pre tax

million pre tax

million  lower than anticipated severance costs 
million and lower than expected losses on asset disposals 
million 
during fiscal  the company reduced by

per share some of its reserves established in connection with the company s implementation of its strategic plan 
this reserve reduction related primarily to a final resolution of lease obligations for a vacated facility and to lower than expected severance costs 
during fiscal  the company  on a net basis  reduced some of its restructuring reserves by million pre tax 
per share  a portion of which is included in cost of sales million 
this reserve reduction related primarily to lower than expected severance costs million  inventory returns million  decisions not to vacate certain leased facilities 
million  and other related costs million in connection with the company s implementation of its strategic plan  partially offset by additional restructuring charges in connection with the consolidation of the graphics and substrates business units in fiscal relating principally to employee severance costs million

this reserve reduction was principally related to lower than expected inventory returns 
in addition  the company reduced in fiscal by 
million pre tax 
per share some of its reserves established in connection with its sale of its bevis office furniture discontinued operation 
this reduction was largely attributable to lower than expected costs associated with accruals  primarily for accounts receivable and fixed assets  established at the time of the divestiture 
as a result of the above divestitures  including the bevis operation  an aggregate of approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis and related earnings will not be available to the company going forward 
management believes a critical part of the strategic plan and the restructuring plan is to offset these revenue and earnings losses through increased focus on the company s graphics products in the rapidly growing digital imaging and sign and display markets  through leveraging of the company s brand strength in consumer products  from internal new product development  and through acquisitions 
also  management believes improved manufacturing processes  rationalization of distribution facilities  and savings in administrative  marketing  and selling support areas will help offset these revenue and earnings losses 
patent infringement litigation several years ago  the company was sued for patent infringement with respect to one of its minor products 
after a jury trial in  the us district court for the western district of wisconsin entered judgment against the company in this matter and awarded damages to the plaintiffs in the amount of million  plus interest and costs 
the verdict was appealed  and  contrary to the expectations of the company and its patent counsel  a three judge panel of the us court of appeals affirmed the judgment in july subsequently  a request  filed with the court of appeals by the company to have the case reconsidered by all twelve judges of the court of appeals  was denied in october as a result  the company recorded a liability of million pre tax including interest and other costs  or 
per share  relating to this matter in fiscal  which amount is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for fiscal under restructuring and other 
however  the company and its patent counsel continue to believe that the verdict against the company was incorrect and are seeking a review of the decision by the supreme court of the united states and are considering other possible courses to challenge the verdict
