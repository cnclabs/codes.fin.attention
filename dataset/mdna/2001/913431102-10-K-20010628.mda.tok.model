the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
general we were formed in december to acquire all of the outstanding stock of tidewater compression service  inc upon completion of the acquisition in february  tidewater compression became our wholly owned operating subsidiary and changed its name to universal compression  inc through this subsidiary  our gas compression service operations date back to during the quarter ended june   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock including  shares of common stock issued pursuant to an overallotment option granted to the underwriters  which provided us with net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million 
concurrently with our initial public offering  we implemented a recapitalization pursuant to which all then existing classes of our stock were converted into common stock 
we used the proceeds of the offering and the million in initial proceeds from an operating lease facility to repay million of indebtedness  and the remaining proceeds for working capital and to pay expenses associated with the offering and concurrent financing transactions 
since our initial public offering  we have completed four acquisitions 
in addition  on may   we entered into an agreement to acquire kci  a fabricator of large horsepower compressors  and on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire louisiana compressor maintenance  a provider of compressor maintenance and repair services 
our completed acquisitions include gas compression services in september  weatherford global and iew compression in february  and compressor systems international  inc  the international operations of compressor systems  inc  in april gcsi added approximately  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with an increased customer base  additional market segments and additional fabrication capabilities 
iew added approximately  horsepower to our fleet  as well as important offshore service capabilities 
compressor systems international added approximately  horsepower to our fleet in mexico and argentina 
our weatherford global acquisition in february more than doubled our size 
we acquired weatherford global  which was the second largest natural gas compression services company in the world in terms of horsepower  for  shares of our common stock approximately of our then total outstanding shares and following the pending stock offering and the restructuring of approximately million in debt and operating lease obligations 
this acquisition added over  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with a number of important strategic and operational benefits  including expanded international operations  an increased parts sales and service business and cost savings and synergies 
in addition to these acquisitions  we entered into agreements to acquire kci on may  and louisiana compressor maintenance on june  in the kci acquisition  we will pay approximately million in cash and  at our election  up to  shares of our common stock or an additional million in cash 
concurrently with the kci acquisition  we will repay all of kci s approximately million of indebtedness 
kci  based in tulsa  oklahoma  will provide us with significant fabrication expertise and a  square foot fabrication facility in tulsa and will add approximately  horsepower to our rental fleet  primarily in large horsepower units 
we will acquire louisiana compressor maintenance for approximately million in cash 
currently  we are the second largest provider of natural gas compressor rental  sales  operations  maintenance and fabrication services to the natural gas industry in terms of horsepower  with one of the largest gas compressor fleets in the us  and a strong presence in key international markets 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  our rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  domestic rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in domestic rental revenues primarily resulted from expansion of our rental fleet through the acquisition of gcsi  weatherford global and core growth 
the increase in international rental revenues resulted from expansion of our international rental fleet primarily through the addition of horsepower from our acquisitions  continued high utilization rates and the impact of our weatherford global acquisition 
during the quarter ended december   we started our first rental project in mexico consisting of  horsepower 
this project contributed approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenues 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  international average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through expansion of our international rental fleet  continued high utilization rates and additional service in south america 
our average horsepower utilization rate for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  up from in the fiscal year ended march  at the end of the quarter  we had approximately million available horsepower with an additional  horsepower operated and maintained for customers 
our average horsepower utilization rate for the quarter ended march  was and at march  was approximately 
these horsepower and utilization amounts include gcsi for the full fourth quarter and weatherford global for the days from the date of the merger 
our revenue from fabrication increased to million from million  an increase of 
the increase in fabrication revenue  consisting mostly of equipment fabrication  for the last half of the fiscal year was due primarily to our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
revenues from fabrication vary quarter to quarter due to the time of completion of the equipment being sold 
our backlog of fabrication projects at the end of the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of million at the same time a year earlier 
from december  to march   our backlog increased million 
our revenues from parts sales and service increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   an increase of 
the increase for the last half of the fiscal year was due primarily to our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
as a result of our weatherford global acquisition  our parts sales and service segment has become a more significant part of our business 
our parts sales and service revenue increased to million from million in the quarter ended march   an increase of from the prior year period  with a gross margin of million on the fiscal year as compared to a gross margin of million for the prior year period 
gross margin 
our gross margin defined as total revenue less rental expense  cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization  gain on asset sales and interest income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  our rental gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  rental gross margin increased primarily as the result of our rental revenue growth discussed above and operating cost improvements realized by rental operations 
our fabrication gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross margin increased primarily due to strong customer demand  cost reductions and their resulting gross margin effects 
our parts sales and service gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  parts sales and service revenue increased primarily due to our acquisition of weatherford global 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased million compared to the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the percentage decrease was primarily due to the approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenues associated with a large rental project in mexico and the elimination of management fees in connection with our initial public offering in may  in addition to synergies achieved in our acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
these reductions have been offset partially by increases in certain expenses related to our operating as a publicly traded company 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increases in horsepower and utilization of the compression rental fleet  gross margin contribution from fabrication and sales  operating cost improvements realized by rental operations  and a decreased percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
ebitda  as adjusted  is defined as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  leasing expense  management fees  depreciation and amortization  excluding non recurring items and extraordinary gains or losses 
ebitda  as adjusted  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of its liquidity 
additionally  the ebitda  as adjusted  computation used herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda  as adjusted  represents a measure upon which management assesses financial performance  and certain covenants in our borrowing arrangements will be tied to similar measures 
we believe that ebitda  as adjusted  is a standard measure of financial performance used for valuing companies in the compression industry 
ebitda  as adjusted  is a useful common yardstick as it measures the capacity of companies to generate cash without reference to how they are capitalized  how they account for significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization associated with assets used in the business the majority of which are long lived assets in the compression industry  or what their tax attributes may be 
non recurring charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred non recurring charges of million related to the early termination of a management agreement and a consulting agreement and other related fees in connection with our initial public offering and concurrent financing transactions as well as costs related to facilities and headcount reduction associated with our weatherford global acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our rental fleet offset partially by the compressor equipment sold and leased back under our previous operating lease facility 
operating lease 
we incurred leasing expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  resulting from our operating lease facilities 
the outstanding balance under the operating lease facilities at march  was million  consisting of million under our new operating lease facility and million under our asset backed securitization operating lease facility 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the reduction of debt resulting from our initial public offering and financing restructurings 
the decrease in interest expense was offset partially by increased accretion of our senior discount notes and the assumption and refinancing of debt related to our gcsi acquisition 
extraordinary loss 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred extraordinary losses of million million net of income tax related to debt restructurings that occurred concurrently with our initial public offering and the weatherford global acquisition 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of an increase in our gross margins and interest expense decreasing from million to million  offset partially by increased depreciation and amortization related to the continued expansion of our assets  leasing expense of million resulting from our operating lease facilities  non recurring charges  an increase of the income tax provision to million from an income tax benefit of million  and an extraordinary loss of million 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  due to an increase in rental revenues 
our rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  domestic rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues primarily resulted from expansion of our rental fleet 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  international average rented horsepower more than doubled to approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through additional service in argentina and colombia 
our revenues from fabrication increased to million from million  an increase of  due to a moderate increase in equipment orders 
our revenues from parts sales and service decreased to million from million  a decrease of  due to our concentration on growing our rental segments as well as a lower level of parts sales and service activity 
gross margin 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  the rental gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  gross margin increased primarily as the result of the revenue growth discussed above while rental margins remained constant at for the fiscal years ended march  and our fabrication gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross margin increased primarily as a result of moderate increases in orders and capacity 
our parts sales and service gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  parts sales and service gross margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as the result of increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility  increased accretion of discount notes  the financing lease and increased interest rates 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net loss was primarily due to interest expense increasing from million to million and depreciation and amortization related to the continued expansion of our assets increasing from million to million  which was offset by an increased income tax benefit and the factors discussed above 
effects of inflation in recent years  inflation has been modest and has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources in may  concurrently with our initial public offering  we entered into a million  five year operating lease facility  which involved a sale and leaseback of compression equipment to a trust 
under this operating lease facility  certain of our compression equipment was sold to the trust for approximately million and leased back by us for a five year period 
at the same time  we repaid and terminated a term loan and revolving credit facility and entered into a million secured revolving credit facility which had a five year term 
this revolver and our previous operating lease facility were repaid and terminated in february in connection with our weatherford global acquisition  as described below 
our cash and cash equivalents balance at march  was million  compared to million at march  for the year ended march   we generated cash flow from operations of million  used million of cash for investing activities and another million of cash in financing activities and had a million positive effect of exchange rate change 
during the year ended march   we received million was received for compression equipment under our new operating lease facility and asset backed securitization operating lease facility  million was received from the sale of compression equipment under our previous operating lease facility and million was received from the initial public offering of our common stock 
we used this cash as follows million in connection with the restructuring and refinancing of our and weatherford global s existing operating lease facilities  million to increase inventory in order to meet increased customer demand  million for capital expenditures  million for acquisitions  and million to make net principal payments on our then outstanding indebtedness  which included termination of our term loan and credit facility  redemption of all of our senior discount notes and retirement of a financing lease arrangement 
our accounts receivable balance increased disproportionately compared to revenues primarily due to our acquisition of weatherford global in february  increased rental billings during the fourth quarter due to additions of rental equipment in our fleet and improved horsepower utilization rates 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of spectrum rotary compression inc from energy spectrum partners lp in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
spectrum added approximately  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with an increased presence in the screw compressor market 
on september   we completed our acquisition of gcsi  a supplier of natural gas compression equipment and services with fabrication and overhaul facilities in michigan and texas for a combination of approximately million in cash   shares of our common stock and the assumption or refinancing of approximately million of indebtedness 
all of the assumed or refinanced indebtedness of gcsi  except for approximately million  was paid off concurrently with the gcsi merger using proceeds received under our previous operating lease facility 
this acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in the recognition of approximately million in goodwill 
the gcsi acquisition added approximately  horsepower to our fleet and provided us with an increased customer base  additional market segments and additional fabrication capabilities 
under current operating conditions  we expect to add million to million in revenue per year and approximately million in ebitda per year as a result of our gcsi acquisition 
on february   we completed our acquisition of weatherford global compression services  lp and certain related compression service entities that supply natural gas compression equipment and services from weatherford international  inc under the terms of the merger agreement  a subsidiary of weatherford international was merged into uci in exchange for million shares of our common stock  which represented approximately of our then outstanding shares approximately following the pending offering  and the restructuring of approximately million in debt and operating leases of weatherford global 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
prior to closing  weatherford international acquired the interest of its minority partner in weatherford global 
in addition  weatherford international retained certain assets and operations related to weatherford global s singapore based operations and approximately million in accounts receivable 
concurrently with our weatherford global acquisition  we raised million under a new operating lease facility funded primarily through the offering of senior secured notes by brl universal equipment a  lp  a third party leasing company  which notes are payable from our lease payments under the operating lease 
we also entered into a new million secured revolving credit facility and a new million asset backed securitization operating lease facility 
as of the closing of the weatherford global acquisition  we had approximately million outstanding under the asset backed securitization operating lease facility and no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we used the proceeds from the two new operating lease facilities to restructure existing operating lease obligations  including our previous operating lease facility and those of weatherford global  and to refinance a significant portion of our existing indebtedness and that of weatherford global 
these new facilities  like our previous facilities  contain restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  engage in acquisitions and pay dividends  among other things 
the deferred gain from our old operating lease facility was transferred to the new operating lease facilities and will be assessed annually for realizability 
as of the closing of our weatherford global acquisition and related financing transactions on february   we had approximately million outstanding under our senior notes and approximately million of other indebtedness 
we also had approximately million outstanding under our new operating lease facility and approximately million outstanding under our new asset backed securitization operating lease facility 
in addition  on february   we funded approximately million under our asset backed securitization operating lease facility primarily for our acquisition of iew  and on april   we funded an additional million under this facility  primarily for our acquisition of compressor systems international 
as of march  we had million aggregate principal amount outstanding under our senior discount notes due in january  uci  the issuer of these notes  commenced an offer to repurchase all of the notes  and solicited the consent of the holders of the notes to amend the indenture to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants 
the tender offer was conditioned upon uci s receipt of the consent of requisite holders to approve the proposed amendments to the indenture 
because the requisite consents were not received prior to the deadline  uci terminated the tender offer without purchasing any of the senior discount notes 
pursuant to the indenture governing those notes  the holders of the notes had the right to require uci to repurchase the notes as a result of the consummation of the weatherford global acquisition at a price equal to of the accreted value  plus accrued and unpaid interest to date 
none of the senior discount notes were tendered by the holders for repurchase 
the holders of the senior discount notes will again have the right to require us to repurchase their senior discount notes upon consummation of the pending stock offering as castle harlan s ownership of less than of our common stock constitutes a change of control under the indenture 
we expect to finance any repurchases of the senior discount notes through our new revolving credit facility or our operating lease facilities 
as of june   we had unused availability of approximately million approximately million under our asset backed securitization facility and million under our revolving credit facility 
under the revolving credit facility  million is currently committed and million is obtainable upon payment of additional fees 
since we have only made short term borrowings for cash management purposes under the revolving credit facility  we have delayed incurring the additional fees to have such additional million committed for future borrowing 
subject to certain covenant restrictions  we also have up to an additional million available under our new operating lease facility until one year from february  additional amounts under this facility would be funded through an additional issuance of senior secured notes by brl and a corresponding increase in the related brl term loan and equity investment 
the proceeds  if any  from the additional notes  term loan and equity investment would then be used to purchase additional equipment to lease to uci under the operating lease 
we entered into an agreement to acquire kci on may  for approximately million in cash and  at our election  up to  shares of our common stock  depending on the closing price of our shares for a specified period prior to the closing date  or an additional million in cash  subject to adjustment 
concurrently with the kci acquisition  we will repay all of kci s approximately million of indebtedness 
this acquisition will provide us with significant fabrication expertise and capabilities and will add approximately  horsepower to our rental fleet with an average horsepower utilization rate of 
as of april   we estimate that kci s fabrication backlog was approximately million 
under current operating conditions and with anticipated synergies  we expect to add approximately million in revenue  approximately million in ebitda  as adjusted  and approximately in earnings per share for the first full year of combined operations if the kci acquisition is consummated 
in addition  on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire louisiana compressor maintenance  a provider of compressor maintenance and repair services  for approximately million in cash 
under current operating conditions  we expect to add approximately million in revenue and approximately million in ebitda  as adjusted  in the first full year of combined operations if this acquisition is consummated 
we intend to finance these acquisitions with proceeds of the pending stock offering and with an additional approximately million million if we elect not to issue shares in our acquisition of kci of funds obtained under our operating lease facilities or revolving credit facility 
these transactions are subject to various closing conditions  including regulatory approvals 
although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will close  we expect them to be consummated in july as of march   we have realized approximately million of cost savings on annualized basis from our weatherford global acquisition  and we expect to realize an additional million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal  primarily through consolidation and streamlining of operations 
however  we may not realize these remaining cost savings as quickly or as fully as we expect 
the key drivers for the savings are the overlap of various domestic operations  including fabrication facilities  as well as duplicate selling  general and administrative activities 
as a result of our weatherford global acquisition  we expect to eliminate a total of two fabrication facilities  sales and service offices and personnel positions for an aggregate expected cost to us of approximately million 
based upon current levels of activity as well as modest increases in our business due to current market conditions and anticipated customer demands but excluding our pending acquisitions of kci and louisiana compressor maintenance  we expect to generate revenues between to million and corresponding ebitda  as adjusted  of million to million for the quarter ending june  in addition  we expect to generate approximately million to million in annual revenue going forward  and the corresponding ebitda  as adjusted  including the full amount of our estimated million of annual cost savings associated with our weatherford global acquisition  is expected to be approximately million to million 
approximately to of revenues in fiscal is expected to result from domestic rentals  with international revenues accounting for to  fabrication accounting for approximately and parts sales and service revenues at to 
the expected gross margins after the cost savings are realized are an initial with a fiscal year end target of to for the domestic rental business  an initial to with a fiscal year end target of to for the international rental business  to for the fabrication segment and an initial to with a fiscal year end target of to for parts sales and service 
we anticipate margins will improve as a result of our operating leverage efficiencies as we continue to grow our fleet and the remaining cost savings and synergies from our weatherford global acquisition to be achieved  as well as other activities we plan to implement 
we anticipate that capital expenditures during fiscal will be approximately million to million  including approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures  million of international horsepower expenditures and the remainder primarily for domestic horsepower expenditures  but excluding acquisitions 
we continue to emphasize our investment in larger horsepower compression rental units and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition leaseback of customer owned equipment 
our other principal uses of cash will be to meet interest and lease payments and to support changes in our working capital 
our average horsepower utilization rate for the year ended march  was  and as of may   our utilization rate was approximately 
we expect this rate to improve slightly over the level during the next year as we continue to improve the utilization of the weatherford global assets in the integration process 
our compressor unit fabrication backlog was approximately million as of march   an increase of million over the prior year 
not including our pending acquisition of kci  we expect our fabrication segment to maintain a million backlog consistent with the past few months 
in addition  we expect to achieve additional savings in purchasing activities and inventory management  as well as other components of working capital  that are not reflected in the million cost savings by the end of fiscal year we expect these additional cost savings  which will impact operating and selling  general and administrative expenses  to be fully realized by the end of fiscal we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses of of revenues for the quarter ended march  to be an indication of these expenses for our fiscal year we anticipate that our effective tax rate in fiscal will be 
on june   we announced the public offering of million shares of the company s common stock at per share  consisting of million shares that are being offered by the company and million shares that are being offered by certain selling stockholders  including castle harlan and its affiliates 
the underwriters may also purchase on a pro rata basis up to an additional  shares from us and an additional  shares from the selling stockholders to cover over allotments  if any 
we anticipate receiving approximately million in net proceeds from the offering 
we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of our shares for pending acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
to the extent these acquisitions are not consummated  we expect to repay amounts outstanding under our operating lease facility 
this report on form k shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy  nor shall there be any sale of the shares in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state 
we believe that funds generated from our operations  together with our existing cash  the net proceeds to us from the pending stock offering  and the additional capacity available under our new credit facility and operating lease facilities will be sufficient to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures and internal growth for fiscal year if we were to make significant additional acquisitions for cash  we may need to obtain additional debt  equity or operating lease financing 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  which amends certain provisions of sfas to clarify four areas causing difficulties in implementation 
the amendment included expanding the normal purchase and sale exemption for supply contracts  permitting the offsetting of certain intercompany foreign currency derivatives and thus reducing the number of third party derivatives  permitting hedge accounting for foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and redefining interest rate risk to reduce sources of ineffectiveness 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
we adopted sfas and the corresponding amendments under sfas on april  this statement had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial positions or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab summarizes certain of the sec s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
on june   the sec issued an amendment to sab  effectively delaying its implementation until the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  after reviewing sab and its amendment  we believe that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and that the effects of sab and its amendment were immaterial to our results of operations 
on february   the fasb issued its tentative decisions on the accounting for goodwill in an exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill 
the fasb has tentatively concluded that purchased goodwill should not be amortized  rather it should be reviewed for impairment 
the final statement is expected to be issued in late july  effective as to financial statements covering fiscal years beginning after december  seasonal fluctuations our results of operations have not historically reflected any material seasonal tendencies 
risk factors as described in part i 
special note regarding forward looking statements  this report contains forward looking statements regarding us  our business and our industry 
the risk factors described below  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect the company and universal 
risks inherent in our industry we depend on strong demand for natural gas  and a prolonged  substantial reduction in this demand could adversely affect the demand for our services and products 
gas compression operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for natural gas 
demand may be affected by  among other factors  natural gas prices  weather  demand for energy and availability of alternative energy sources 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for natural gas would  in all likelihood  depress the level of production  exploration and development activity and result in a decline in the demand for our compression services and products 
similarly  a decrease in capital spending by our customers could result in reduced demand for our fabrication services or our parts sales and service business 
these events could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we intend to continue to make substantial capital investments to implement our business strategy  which may reduce funds available for other operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital investments to expand our compressor rental fleet 
for the year ended march   net of asset sales other than under our operating leases  we invested approximately million in capital investments  excluding acquisitions 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures during fiscal year  excluding acquisitions 
historically  we have financed these investments through internally generated funds  debt offerings and our credit facility and lease financings 
these significant capital investments require cash that we could otherwise apply to other business needs 
however  if we do not incur these expenditures while our competitors make substantial fleet investments  our market share may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash internally or obtain alternative sources of capital  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and growth 
we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy  which may adversely affect our ability to finance our future growth 
our ability to implement our business strategy successfully depends upon a number of factors including competition  availability of working capital and general economic conditions 
significant elements of our business strategy include growth of our market share and broader participation in the international market for compression services 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in implementing our strategy or be able to obtain financing for this strategy on acceptable terms 
the indenture governing our senior discount notes and our new revolving credit facility and operating lease facilities substantially limit our ability to incur additional debt to finance our growth strategy 
see business growth strategy 
most of our compressor leases have short initial terms  and we would not recoup the costs of our investment if we were unable to subsequently lease the compressors 
in most cases  the initial terms of our compressor leases with customers are short  with the most common initial term being six months and continuing on a month to month basis thereafter at the election of the customer 
the initial terms of our leases are too short to enable us to recoup the average cost of acquiring or fabricating compressors under currently prevailing lease rates 
as a result  we assume substantial risk of not recovering our entire investment in the equipment we acquire or fabricate 
although we historically have been successful in subsequently leasing our compressors  we may not be able to continue to do so and a substantial number of our rental customers could terminate their leases at approximately the same time 
even if we are successful in re leasing our compressors as we have been in the past  we may not be able to obtain favorable rental rates 
this would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
natural gas service operations are subject to inherent risks such as equipment defects  malfunction and failures and natural disasters which can result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids  fires and explosions 
these risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  wrongful death  property damage  pollution and other environmental damages 
although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities 
further  insurance covering the risks we face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or  if available  the premiums may not be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to substantial environmental regulation  and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities 
we are subject to stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulatory standards  including laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment  emission controls and other environmental protection and occupational health and safety concerns 
see business environmental and other regulations 
environmental laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering us liable for remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior owners or operators or other third parties 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
remediation costs and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations  and costs associated with new information  changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
moreover  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we currently are engaged in remediation and monitoring activities with respect to some of our properties 
the cost of these activities has not been  and we currently do not expect it to be  material to us 
we believe that former owners and operators of some of these properties may be responsible under environmental laws and contractual agreements to pay for or perform some of these activities  or to indemnify us for some of our remediation costs 
there can be no assurance that these other entities will fulfill their legal or contractual obligations  and their failure to do so could result in material costs to us 
we routinely deal with natural gas  oil and other petroleum products 
as a result of our engineered products and overhaul and field operations  we generate  manage and dispose of or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents  thinner  waste paint  waste oil  washdown wastes and sandblast material 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on or under other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigatory  remediation and monitoring requirements under foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated service companies 
we face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance 
the natural gas compression rental service  equipment fabrication  and parts sales and service businesses are highly competitive 
many of our competitors also offer a wide range of compressors for sale or lease  and there are low barriers to entry for individual projects 
in addition  we compete with several large national and multinational companies which provide compression services to third parties  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
if our competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to the development and marketing of competitive products and services  we may not be able to compete effectively 
in addition  in our weatherford global acquisition  we acquired most  but not all  of the compression operations of weatherford international inc weatherford retained certain foreign compression assets that it acquired in a recent acquisition and is not contractually restricted from competing with us 
risks specific to our company we may not be able to successfully integrate weatherford global into our business  which could cause us not to realize all of the expected benefits of the weatherford global acquisition 
our weatherford global acquisition was significantly larger than any of our previous acquisitions and doubled our size 
integrating weatherford global s business into ours is an ongoing process involving a number of potential challenges and costs  including combining  reducing and relocating workforces  facilities and offices and combining systems  processes  administrative functions and corporate cultures 
management issues facing our company are likely to be more complex and challenging than those faced by us prior to our acquisition of weatherford global 
in addition  we acquired in that acquisition significant foreign operations in areas where we have little or no prior operating experience 
the integration process could cause operational difficulties  divert the attention of our management away from managing our business to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of weatherford global and have adverse effects on our operating results 
furthermore  if our integration of weatherford global is not successful  we may lose personnel  not be able to retain our customer base to the extent expected and experience increased costs and reduced revenues 
we may not achieve all of the cost savings and other synergies we expect to result from our recent weatherford global acquisition 
we expect the integration of weatherford global into our business to result in significant cost savings 
however  our success in realizing these cost savings  and the timing of this realization  depends on the quality and speed of the integration of our two companies 
although we have realized the benefit of some of these costs savings  we may not realize the remaining cost savings that we anticipate from integrating our operations as quickly or as fully as we expect for a number of reasons  including the large size and broad geographic presence and the resulting complexity of our company following the weatherford global acquisition  our lack of operating experience in several international areas added in the weatherford global acquisition  errors in our planning or integration  loss of key personnel  information technology systems failure  unexpected events such as major changes in the markets in which we operate  and costs associated with the acquisition and integration of weatherford global into our business may exceed our current expectations 
further  our ability to realize cost savings could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions and regulatory developments 
we are highly leveraged  a significant portion of our cash flow must be used to service our debt and we are vulnerable to interest rate increases 
as of june   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness  including capital leases and operating lease facilities 
of this amount  approximately million bears interest at floating rates 
as of that date  we also had unused availability of approximately million million under our new revolving credit facility  subject to commitment of the additional million  and approximately million under our new asset backed securitization operating lease facility 
both the interest payments under our new credit facility and a portion of the lease payments under our new operating lease facilities bear interest at a floating rate based on a base rate or libor  at our option  in the case of the credit facility  and based on libor  in the case of the operating lease facility  plus a variable amount depending on our operating results 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest and lease payment rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and lease payments and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or other purposes 
if  during the term of the operating lease facilities  the realizable value of the equipment under the facilities is insufficient to satisfy the obligations under the facilities  we may be required to record a loss for our residual value guarantees and may have insufficient funds to provide for repayment of our obligations 
our significant leverage increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
in addition  a substantial portion of our cash flow must be used to service our debt and lease obligations  which may affect our ability to make acquisitions or capital expenditures 
our financing arrangements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to finance future operations or engage in attractive business transactions 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our new credit facility and our new operating lease facilities  each of which contains covenants that restrict our operations 
the indenture governing our senior discount notes also contains restrictive covenants 
these covenants place limitations on  among other things  our ability to enter into acquisitions  asset sales and operating lease transactions  and to incur additional indebtedness and create liens 
these covenants could hinder our flexibility and restrict our ability to take advantage of market opportunities or respond to changing market conditions 
in addition  the completion of the pending stock offering will result in a change of control under the indenture governing our senior discount notes 
as a result  each holder of the senior discount notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to of the accreted value  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of the repurchase 
to the extent that holders of the senior discount notes require us to repurchase the notes  we currently intend to finance the repurchase through our new revolving credit facility and operating lease facilities  which may reduce our funds available for our other business needs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our international operations  which increased significantly as a result of our weatherford global acquisition  subject us to risks that are difficult to predict 
for the year ended march   we derived approximately of our revenues from international operations 
we have limited operating experience in some of the international regions we acquired through our weatherford global acquisition  including canada and thailand 
we intend to continue to expand our business in canada  latin america and southeast asia and  ultimately  into other international markets 
our international operations are affected by global economic and political conditions  and we may encounter difficulties managing our international operations 
changes in economic or political conditions and in legal or regulatory requirements in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement  new currency or exchange controls  expropriation or other trade restrictions  including tariffs  being imposed on our operations 
many of these factors are outside of our control 
in addition  the financial condition of foreign customers may not be as strong as that of our current domestic customers 
weatherford s voting power may give it the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  and thus limit the rights of our other stockholders to influence our affairs 
currently  an affiliate of weatherford beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
following the pending common stock offering  weatherford will beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
pursuant to a voting agreement entered into concurrently with our acquisition of weatherford global  weatherford has agreed to limit its voting power to of our outstanding common stock until the earlier of two years from the closing of that acquisition or the date that castle harlan and its affiliates own less than of our outstanding common stock 
the sale of shares by castle harlan in the offering may result in a termination of the voting agreement if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised  giving weatherford voting control over the full amount of our shares that it then owns 
in addition to its voting control  weatherford and its affiliates are entitled to designate three persons to serve on our board of directors for so long as they own at least of our outstanding common stock 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  weatherford may designate only two directors 
if weatherford s ownership falls below  it will no longer have the right to designate directors to our board 
currently  bernard j 
duroc danner  curtis w 
huff and uriel e 
dutton are serving as weatherford s designees to our board 
castle harlan also is entitled currently to designate a total of three persons to our board of directors 
although it will lose this right following the pending stock offering  its current designees  john k 
castle and william m 
pruellage  are serving terms that do not expire until our annual meeting of stockholders 
this voting power  significant stock ownership and board representation gives weatherford the ability to exercise substantial influence over our ownership  policies  management and affairs and significant control over actions requiring approval of our stockholders 
weatherford s interests could conflict with our other stockholders 
see item certain relationships and related transactions for further information regarding our relationship with weatherford 
sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock could depress our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  particularly as our stock is thinly traded 
upon completion of the pending stock offering  we will have  shares of common stock outstanding  shares if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full  all of which are freely tradeable without restriction or further registration under the securities act unless they are held by persons deemed to be our affiliates or acting as underwriters  as those terms are defined in the securities act 
we  our executive officers and directors  and some of our other significant stockholders have agreed not to sell any shares of common stock for a period of days from the date of the pending stock offering without the consent of merrill lynch 
we had reserved  shares of our common stock for issuance under our incentive stock option plan  and options covering  of these shares are outstanding as of may  in addition  the shares of our common stock issued to a subsidiary of weatherford in our acquisition of weatherford global and to some of our other stockholders  including the remaining shares held by castle harlan following the pending stock offering  are subject to demand and piggyback registration rights and may be resold at anytime 
any shares issued in our pending acquisition of kci up to  shares also will be subject to registration rights following the lock up period 
the sale of a substantial number of shares within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease  making it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock and to acquire businesses using our stock as consideration 
the market price of our common stock is volatile 
historically  the market price of common stock of companies engaged in the natural gas industry has been highly volatile 
similarly  the market price of our common stock has varied significantly since our initial public offering in may in particular  changes in natural gas prices or in the demand for natural gas could affect the price of our common stock 
we may not be successful in identifying potential acquisition candidates and it may be more difficult or expensive to complete future acquisitions using our stock as consideration if our stock price decreases 
in accordance with our business strategy  we intend to pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing business 
we are unable to predict whether or when any suitable candidate will become available or the likelihood of a material acquisition being completed 
even if we are able to identify acceptable acquisition candidates  the acquisition of a business involves a number of potential risks  including the diversion of management s attention away from managing our business to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business and possible short term adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process 
in addition  we may seek to finance any such acquisition through the issuance of new debt and or equity securities 
alternatively  a substantial portion of our financial resources could be used to complete any large acquisition for cash  which would reduce our funds available for capital investment  operations or other activities 
we are dependent on particular suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases 
as a consequence of having a highly standardized fleet  some of the components used in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on these suppliers involves several risks  including price increases  inferior component quality and a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components in a timely manner 
the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have at least a temporary material adverse effect on our results of operations and could damage our customer relationships 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operations may be adversely affected by significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
our revenues from international operations and  as a result  our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  have increased as a result of our weatherford global acquisition 
although we attempt to match costs and revenues in local currencies  we anticipate that as we continue our expansion on a global basis  there may be many instances in which costs and revenues will not be matched with respect to currency denomination 
as a result  we expect that increasing portions of our revenues  costs  assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations 
although we may use foreign currency forward contracts or other currency hedging mechanisms from time to time to minimize our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  we may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or  if we do implement them  that they will achieve the desired effect 
we may experience economic losses and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
further  the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency  resulting in our inability to hedge against these risks 
our ability to manage our business effectively will be weakened if we lose key personnel 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management  including stephen a 
snider  our president and chief executive officer 
this dependence likely will be intensified now that we have completed the weatherford global acquisition  as a number of our senior executives have substantial experience in managing the challenges presented by rapid growth through acquisitions 
the departure of any of our key personnel  including weatherford global employees who joined us as a result of the weatherford global acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we currently have an employment agreement with only one of our executive officers 
we do not maintain key man life insurance coverage with respect to mr 
snider or any of our other executive officers or key management personnel 
we are not aware of the upcoming retirement of any of our executive officers or senior management personnel 
in addition  we believe that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
if we fail to recruit other skilled personnel  we could be unable to compete effectively 
uch is a holding company and relies on its subsidiaries for operating income 
uch is a holding company and  as such  it derives all of its operating income from its operating subsidiary  and its subsidiaries 
uch does not have any significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiary 
consequently  it is dependent on the earnings and cash flow of its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends 
its subsidiaries are separate legal entities that are not legally obligated to make funds available to it  and in some cases may be contractually restricted from doing so 
we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will be able to  or be permitted to  pay to us amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to pay dividends 
a third party could be prevented from acquiring control of us because of the anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws 
there are provisions in uch s restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if a change in control would result in the purchase of your shares at a premium to the market price or would otherwise be beneficial to you 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  such as a staggered board of directors and limitations on the removal of directors  no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
delaware corporation law may also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by our board of directors 
we do not expect to pay dividends 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends is restricted by our credit facility  the indenture governing our senior discount notes and our operating lease facilities and other financing arrangements 
goodwill and other assets represent a substantial percentage of our assets  the amortization of which will adversely affect our earnings 
as of march   our balance sheet reflected million of goodwill and other assets  net of amortization  which includes a preliminary allocation of goodwill of approximately million added in connection with our acquisition of weatherford global 
we had total assets as of march  of  million 
amortization of goodwill and other assets will have a negative impact on our earnings 
in addition  we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable or should be amortized over a shorter period 
when factors indicate that assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we may be required to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
when factors indicate that these assets will be valuable for a period shorter than originally anticipated  we may be required to amortize a larger portion of the remaining balance of these assets over a shorter remaining life 
the reduction in carrying value or amortization period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  as our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements 
this report contains forward looking statements about our operations  economic performances and financial condition 
these statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates  which are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control  and reflect future business decisions  which are subject to change 
some of these assumptions inevitably will not materialize  and unanticipated events will occur which will affect our results of operations

the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  and the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see part i 
special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
universal s total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  domestic rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in domestic rental revenue primarily resulted from expansion of the rental fleet through the acquisition of gcsi  weatherford global and core growth 
the increase in international rental revenue resulted from expansion of the international rental fleet primarily through the addition of horsepower from universal s acquisitions  continued high utilization rates and the impact of our weatherford global acquisition 
during the quarter ended december   universal we started their first rental project in mexico consisting of  horsepower 
this project contributed approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenue 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  international average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through expansion of the international rental fleet  continued high utilization rates and additional service in south america 
average horsepower utilization rate for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately  up from in the fiscal year ended at the end of the quarter  universal had approximately million available horsepower with an additional  horsepower operated and maintained for customers 
average horsepower utilization rate for the quarter ended march  was and at march  was approximately 
these horsepower and utilization amounts include gcsi for the full fourth quarter and weatherford global for the days from the date of the merger 
revenue from fabrication increased to million from million  an increase of 
the increase in fabrication revenue  consisting mostly of equipment fabrication  for the last half of the fiscal year was due primarily to the acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
revenues from fabrication vary quarter to quarter due to the time of completion of the equipment being sold 
universal s backlog of fabrication projects at the end of the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  compared with a backlog of million at the same time a year earlier 
from december  to march   backlog increased million 
revenues from parts sales and service increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   an increase of 
the increase for the last half of the fiscal year was due primarily to the acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
as a result of the weatherford global acquisition  universal s parts sales and service segment has become a more significant part of the business 
parts sales and service revenue increased to million from million in the quarter ended march   an increase of from the prior year period  with a gross margin of million on the fiscal year as compared to a gross margin of million for the prior year period 
gross margin 
universal s gross margin defined as total revenue less rental expense  cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization  gain on asset sales and interest income for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  rental gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  rental gross margin increased primarily as the result of universal s rental revenue growth discussed above and operating cost improvements realized by rental operations 
fabrication gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  fabrication gross margin increased primarily due to strong customer demand  cost reductions and their resulting gross margin effects 
parts sales and service gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million or  to million compared to a gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  parts sales and service revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of weatherford global 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
universal s selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased million compared to the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the percentage decrease was primarily due to the approximately million in one time turnkey installation revenues associated with a large rental project in mexico and the elimination of management fees in connection with holdings our initial public offering in may  in addition to synergies achieved in the acquisitions of gcsi and weatherford global 
these reductions have been offset partially by increases in certain expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increases in horsepower and utilization of the compression rental fleet  gross margin contribution from fabrication and sales  operating cost improvements realized by rental operations  and a decreased percentage of selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
ebitda  as adjusted  is defined as net income plus income taxes  interest expense  leasing expense  management fees  depreciation and amortization  excluding non recurring items and extraordinary gains or losses 
ebitda  as adjusted  is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of universal s operating performance or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of its liquidity 
additionally  the ebitda  as adjusted  computation used herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda  as adjusted  represents a measure upon which management assesses financial performance  and certain covenants in our borrowing arrangements will be tied to similar measures 
we believe that ebitda  as adjusted  is a standard measure of financial performance used for valuing companies in the compression industry 
ebitda  as adjusted  is a useful common yardstick as it measures the capacity of companies to generate cash without reference to how they are capitalized  how they account for significant non cash charges for depreciation and amortization associated with assets used in the business the majority of which are long lived assets in the compression industry  or what their tax attributes may be 
non recurring charges 
during the fiscal year ended march   universal incurred non recurring charges of million related to the early termination of a management agreement and a consulting agreement and other related fees in connection with holdings initial public offering and concurrent financing transactions as well as costs related to facilities and headcount reduction associated with the weatherford global acquisition 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended march   compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase resulted primarily from expansion of the rental fleet offset partially by the compressor equipment sold and leased back under the previous operating lease facility 
operating lease 
universal incurred leasing expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  resulting from the operating lease facilities 
the outstanding balance under the operating lease facilities at march  was million  consisting of million under the new operating lease facility and million under the asset backed securitization operating lease facility 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of the reduction of debt resulting from uch s initial public offering and financing restructurings 
the decrease in interest expense was offset partially by increased accretion of our senior discount notes and the assumption and refinancing of debt related to the gcsi acquisition 
extraordinary loss 
during the fiscal year ended march   we incurred extraordinary losses of million million net of income tax related to debt restructurings that occurred concurrently with our initial public offering and the weatherford global acquisition 
net loss 
universal had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as a result of an increase in gross margins and interest expense decreasing from million to million  offset partially by increased depreciation and amortization related to the continued expansion of universal s assets  leasing expense of million resulting from the operating lease facilities  non recurring charges  an increase of the income tax provision to million from an income tax benefit of million  and an extraordinary loss of million 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues 
universal s total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  due to an increase in rental revenues 
rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  domestic rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  our international rental revenues increased by million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in both domestic and international rental revenues primarily resulted from expansion of the rental fleet 
domestic average rented horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to approximately  horsepower from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  in addition  international average rented horsepower more than doubled to approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march  from approximately  horsepower for the fiscal year ended march   primarily through additional service in argentina and colombia 
revenues from fabrication and sales decreased to million from million  a decrease of  due to a lower level of equipment and parts activity 
gross margin 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million from gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  the rental gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  to million compared to gross margin of million for the fiscal year ended march  gross margin increased primarily as the result of the revenue growth discussed above while rental margins remained constant at for the fiscal years ended march  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
universal s selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  compared to of revenues for the fiscal year ended march  interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily as the result of increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility  increased accretion of discount notes  the financing lease and increased interest rates 
net loss 
universal had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net loss was primarily due to interest expense increasing from million to million and depreciation and amortization related to the continued expansion of universal s assets increasing from million to million  which was offset by an increased income tax benefit and the factors discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating or variable interest rates under our financing arrangements 
a portion of the interest and lease payments under our financing arrangements are based on a floating rate a base rate or libor  at our option  in the case of our revolving credit facility  and libor  in the case of our operating lease facilities plus a variable amount based on our operating results 
the one month libor rate at march  was 
a increase in interest rates would result in a million annual increase in interest and operating lease expense 
as of march   approximately million of our indebtedness and other obligations outstanding bear interest at floating rates 
in order to minimize any significant foreign currency credit risk  we generally contractually require that payment by our customers be made in us dollars 
if payment is not made in us dollars  we generally utilize the exchange rate into us dollars on the payment date or balance payments in local currency against local expenses
