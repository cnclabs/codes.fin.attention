overview novoste commenced operations as a medical device company in may since  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing the beta cath tm system 
on november   novoste received us marketing approval for the beta cath tm system from the fda for use in patients suffering from in stent restenosis  a condition in which coronary stents become clogged with new tissue growth 
since our inception through december  we earned minimal revenues and experienced significant losses in each period 
the company commenced the active marketing of the beta cath tm system in europe in january we have generated only limited revenue and do not have experience in manufacturing  marketing or selling our products in quantities necessary for achieving profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses through at least as we allocate significant resources to increasing our manufacturing operations  both internally and with outside vendors  invest significantly in expanding our sales and marketing efforts in support of united states market development and increase our administrative activities to support our growth 
at the same time we will continue to conduct clinical trials and research and development projects in order to expand the opportunities for our technology 
while the beta cath tm system has been approved by the fda for use in patients suffering from in stent restenosis  future clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of other or different applications or utilizations of the product 
additionally  the hospitals and catheterization labs that will be our customers may not obtain necessary approvals for the beta cath tm system from the state  federal or foreign governmental agencies that regulate the medical use of radiation 
our research and development efforts may not be successfully completed 
manufacturing of our products may be delayed by production problems or our vendors may be unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our needs 
we may not successfully introduce the beta cath tm system or attract any significant level of market acceptance for the beta cath tm system or any other product we develop 
we may never achieve significant revenues from sales of our beta cath tm system and we may never achieve or sustain profitability
