capital expenditures were entirely for production equipment 
twelve months ended november  the company s main source of funds was additional bank borrowings 
the main uses of funds by operating activities were increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
the accounts receivable increase results from a slower payment pattern for our own branded equipment which increased the days outstanding from days to days 
inventory increased due primarily to case tillage equipment production scheduled for december expenditures for capital equipment were  including  to upgrade computer hardware and software 
the balance of the expenditures was spent on production equipment

at november  and   and  were available for borrowings  respectively 
the interest rate is based on the bank s referenced rate and is variable based upon certain performance objectives with a maximum of plus of the referenced rate and a minimum of plus zero at november  
the long term loan was for an original principal amount of  the principal amount is repayable in monthly installments of  with the remaining balance due april all loans  advances and other obligations  liabilities and indebtedness of the company are secured by all present and future assets 
the company pays an unused line fee equal to three eighths of one percent of the unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
during the company was notified by its lender that the company does not fit the lender s customer profile and was requested to relocate its financing needs 
at november  and  the company was in default of a loan covenant  the fixed maturity coverage  of their credit facility and installment promissory note 
the lender notified the company that the current loan agreement provided that the lender may  as a result of any event of default  accelerate the payment of all obligations 
as a result  all long term borrowings associated with this lender had been classified as current 
the lender did not call for the acceleration of the payment of all obligations  but retained the right to do so at any time 
the initial term of the loan agreement ended on august  in a letter dated may  the company was notified that the lender did not intend to extend the term of the loan agreement beyond the termination date 
therefore  all of the obligations outstanding under the credit agreement and long term loan amounting to  at august  were due and payable on august  on august  the loan agreement was amended and the lender agreed not to exercise its rights and remedies under the loan agreement until october  and to extend the maturity date of the loan agreement to october  effective october  the loan agreement was amended

lending institutions are reluctant to expand their loan portfolios in the agriculture sector of the economy until the depressed state of the farm economy improves 
in addition  the size of the loan is difficult to place as the loan required is too large and specialized for many local lenders and too small for the regional and national lenders 
while the company believes a new credit facility will be obtained  there is no assurance of such 
if the company is unable to obtain a new credit facility prior to the expiration of its existing facility on april   it will be unable to repay its out standing balance due april  the company s current ratio and its working capital are as shown in the following table november  november  november  current assets    current liabilities    working capital    current ratio the company believes the funding expected to be generated from operations and provided by the new credit facility when established  and its existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital investment needs

per share in the prior year 
revenues from art s way branded products were down while oem sales decreased 
the reduction in sales reflects the continuing weakness in the farm economy 
the agricultural niche markets the company serves were all hit very hard by declining prices in both livestock and commodities 
the sugar beet industry has suffered from over production and increasing competition from the sugar cane industry and competition from foreign sources 
these market situations and a general lack of confidence by us farmers in the direction the us agricultural industry will move has adversely affected the company 
the one main area of good activity was the cattle industry where increased demand for beef caused an increase in beef cattle prices  which resulted in good demand for our feed processing equipment 
gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from for the year ended november  to for the year ended november  this decrease was primarily due to selling old inventory at distressed prices and a  inventory valuation writedown to realign the inventory values to current market conditions in the agricultural industry 
manufacturing costs were approximately  lower in fiscal year than in due to the cost reduction measures implemented december  operating expenses were down  from the previous year even after recognizing approximately  in bad debt expense associated with customers struggling or going out of business in the distressed agriculture economy 
this reduction in operating expenses was due to the cost reduction measures implemented december  other deductions decreased slightly from the previous year 
interest on lower bank borrowings was offset by higher interest rates 
lower costs on the company s program to offer floor plan financing to our larger dealers reflects the reduced sales levels 
the company has implemented cost reduction programs that have reduced its work force from to  which  when combined with other cost reductions  will reduce manufacturing and operating overhead by approximately  other cost reductions include reduced manufacturing costs accomplished through manufacturing efficiency improvement programs  reduced warranty costs accomplished through quality programs and other variable cost controlling initiatives 
the company is now structured to be more market responsive and profitable 
additionally  there are opportunities to supply major oem s with their branded products and to build component parts for other manufacturing companies 
these actions will serve to return the company to profitability in fiscal year the company believes the current farm economy has reduced the number of our competitors  our core business has bottomed out and  with our diversification efforts  feel we are now positioned to move back to a growth mode 
twelve months ended november  compared to the twelve months ended november  revenue decreased to  from  while the company recorded a net loss of  
per share compared to a net loss of  
per share in the prior year 
revenues from art s way branded products were down while oem sales decreased 
the art s way reduction in revenue resulted from lower demand for art s way branded products 
the oem reduction in revenue was primarily the result of the company s large oem customer instituting inventory reduction programs due to the distressed agriculture economy 
gross profit percent improved from in to in mainly due to the higher proportion of art s way branded products  which generally carry a higher standard margin  combined with improved manufacturing efficiencies 
operating expenses were down  from the previous year 
lower engineering expenses reflect less new product development costs  lower selling expenses reflect lower level of sales  while lower general and administrative expenses in reflect a significant increase in bad debt reserve in to cover the adverse potato market conditions 
overall  operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from in to in a lower level of borrowings resulted in lower interest costs 
other expenses decreased  higher costs on the company s program to offer floor plan financing to our larger dealers through a third party was offset by a debt forgiveness on some of the company s state of iowa community development block grant loans 
the edsa loan agreement provided that if the company met certain contract obligations in regard to job creation retention  demonstrating benefit to low and moderate income individuals and investment   of the debt would be forgiven

utilization of deferred tax assets the company has established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately  and  at november  and respectively  due to the uncertainty of realizing various nol and tax credit carryforwards 
there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at november  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets for these years  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the expiration dates of tax credits and carry forwards and projected future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of the november  net deferred tax assets
