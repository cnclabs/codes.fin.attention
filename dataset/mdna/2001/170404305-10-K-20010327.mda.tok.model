for arrangements with multiple elements  chordiant recognizes revenues for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
in situations in which chordiant is not responsible for implementation services but is obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future  chordiant recognizes revenue as a subscription ratably over the term of the commitment period 
chordiant recognizes service revenues from consulting and training services as these services are performed

in the future  chordiant expects to derive revenues from contracts that provide for implementation services at a fixed hourly rate 
on other contracts  chordiant expects to derive revenues from the licensing of the installed product on a per transaction basis

service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
to help ensure the success of early product deployments by customers  in early chordiant began establishing a significant service organization 
the organization assists customers  and third parties  such as system integrators  in the design and implementation of chordiant s products 
since service revenues have a lower gross margin than license revenues  this service activity resulted in reduced overall gross margins 
since the fourth quarter of  chordiant engaged third parties to provide services to customers  who then billed chordiant for their services 
as a result of using third party resources  revenues from these contracts generated small gross margins 
as a result of expansion of its service organization and use of system integrators that bill its customers directly for services  chordiant believes that its use of third party service providers will decline substantially in future periods 
chordiant expects that service revenue will continue to represent over of total revenues 
chordiant sells its products through its direct sales force  and augments its sales efforts through relationships with system integrators  application service providers and technology vendors

chordiant believes international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of its total revenues in future periods 
a small number of customers account for a significant portion of chordiant s total net revenues 
as a result  the loss or delay of individual orders or delays in the product implementations for a customer can have a material impact on its revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues from eds  lloyds tsb and direct line group services limited accounted for approximately  and of its total net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   revenues from chase manhattan mortgage corporation  first usa and eds accounted for  and of its total net revenues  respectively

the number of chordiant s fulltime employees increased from at december   to at december   to at december   representing increases of approximately and  respectively 
chordiant anticipates that its operating expenses will continue to increase as it expands its product development  sales and marketing and professional services organization 
chordiant expects to incur net losses in the future 
chordiant believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
chordiant s prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance chordiant will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
in addition  although chordiant has experienced revenue growth recently  this trend may not continue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about chordiant s market risk chordiant is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk 
chordiant s exposure to market rate risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
chordiant has not used derivative financial instruments in chordiant s investment portfolio 
chordiant invests chordiant s excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
chordiant protects and preserves chordiant s invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
chordiant s interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of chordiant s investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of chordiant s investments  chordiant believes that there is no material risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures have been provided 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  chordiant s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or chordiant may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
chordiant utilizes foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain receivables that are denominated in british pounds  thereby limiting chordiant s risk 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
chordiant has entered into foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than nine months  to sell approximately pounds million 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate 
the counterparty to these contracts is a substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial bank 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are considered to be not material 
notwithstanding chordiant s efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that chordiant s hedging activities will adequately protect chordiant against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about chordiant s foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
contract weighted contract amount in average amount in fair british pounds contract rate us dollars value in thousands in thousands in thousands foreign currency to be sold under contract british pounds pounds   while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of chordiant s exposure to credit risk 
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of the counterparty to meet the terms of its contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparty s obligations exceed chordiant s obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at chordiant s option 
chordiant controls credit risk through limits and monitoring procedures 
chordiant s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  chordiant s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
