high low nd quarter through april st quarter th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter th quarter rd quarter nd quarter st quarter the company has never declared a cash dividend on its common stock 
for the foreseeable future  it is anticipated that earnings generated from the operations of the company will be used to finance the company s growth and to repurchase shares of its stock and that cash dividends will not be paid to holders of the common stock 
any decision by the board of directors of the company to pay cash dividends in the future will depend upon  among other factors  the company s earnings  financial condition and capital requirements 
in addition  the company s ability to pay dividends is dependent in part on its ability to derive dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by pplci and ufl is restricted under the oklahoma insurance code to available surplus funds derived from realized net profits and requires the approval of the oklahoma insurance commissioner for any dividend representing more than of such accumulated available surplus or an amount representing more than the previous years net profits 
during  the company received a million dividend from pplci and a million dividend from ufl after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals 
pplsif is similarly restricted pursuant to the insurance laws of florida

tpn was merged into the company in a tax free exchange of  shares after adjustment for fractional shares of the company s common stock effective october  additionally  the consolidated balance sheet data reflects the december  acquisition of universal fidelity life insurance company ufl that was accounted for as a purchase transaction and accordingly  none of the operating results of ufl are included in any periods prior to see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
change in accounting principle during  the company changed its methodology for evaluating the recoverability of its commission advance receivables from terminated or d status sales associates 
see risk factors in this item below 
d status associates are those that are no longer active because they fail to meet the company s established vesting requirements by either selling at least three new memberships per quarter or retaining a personal membership 
d status associates lose their right to any further commissions earned on memberships previously sold at the time they are placed in d status 
as a result  the company is entitled to retain all commission earnings that would otherwise be payable to these terminated associates to recover their unearned commission receivable balances 
prior to  the company pooled the activity of this d status group of former associates and accounted for the group and evaluated the collectibility of their commission advance receivables as if it were a single associate rather than on an associate by associate basis 
the company determined that it would change its methodology in such that the company now evaluates the collectibility of d status commission advance receivables on an individual associate basis as it does the advances to its active associates 
the cumulative effect of this change on prior years is reflected separately and resulted in a reduction of income net of applicable income taxes of million  of approximately million 
per basic and diluted share 
the effect of the change on fiscal was a reduction in income net of applicable income taxes of million of approximately million 
per basic and diluted share 
the company believes that an evaluation of the collectibility of commission advance receivables on an associate by associate basis is preferable to an evaluation on a pooled basis because it results in a more refined estimate of collectibility 
membership fees and membership benefit costs the company s principal revenues are derived from membership fees  most of which are collected on a monthly basis 
memberships are generally guaranteed renewable and non cancelable except for fraud  non payment of membership fees or upon written request 
membership fees are recognized in income when due in accordance with membership terms  which generally require the holder of the membership to remit fees on at least a monthly basis 
approximately of our members remit their membership fees to us on a monthly basis 
the company records any amount received in excess of that currently due as deferred revenue and recognizes such deferred amount as income when earned 
for example  a payment received representing an annual payment would be recognized as income to the extent of one month and the remaining months would be deferred in month one and then ratably recognized as income in each of the succeeding months 
the company also charges new members  who are not part of an employee group  a enrollment fee 
this fee is deferred and recognized in income over the estimated life of a membership 
more than of active memberships at december  have benefits delivered by a designated provider law firm with whom the company has arranged for the services to be provided in a particular geographic area  typically a state or province 
provider law firms receive a fixed monthly payment for each member in their service area and are responsible for providing the membership benefits without additional remuneration 
the fixed cost aspect of this arrangement provides significant advantages to the company in managing its claims risk 
pursuant to these provider law firm arrangements  the company has the ability to more effectively monitor the quality of legal services provided and  due to the volume of claims that may be directed to particular provider law firms  has access to larger  more diversified law firms 
membership benefit costs relating to non provider memberships open panel memberships or memberships in states where a provider law firm is not in place  which constituted less than of memberships in force at december   are based on the usual  reasonable and customary fee for providing the required services 
such costs are generally paid on a current basis  as most costs are certain in amount and require only limited investigation 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated incurred but not reported open panel membership benefit costs as well as costs which are in the payment process 
these reserves are reviewed annually by an independent actuary as necessary in conjunction with the preparation and filing of financial statements and other reports with various state insurance regulatory authorities 
underwriting risks associated with the open panel memberships are managed primarily through contractual benefit limitations and  as a result  underwriting decisions are not necessarily based on individual membership purchases 
commission expense beginning with new memberships written after march   the company implemented a level commission schedule which results in the company incurring commission expense related to the sale of its legal expense plans on a basis consistent with the recognition of the premiums generated by the sale of such memberships 
prior to march   the company s commission program resulted in recognizing commission expense of approximately of membership premiums during the first year of the membership and approximately in all subsequent years 
the level commission structure results in the company incurring commission expense at the rate of approximately per year for all membership years 
effective april  the company modified its compensation plan to consolidate the lower four levels of its compensation structure into two levels 
at the same time  the company implemented a two year advance at the lowest commission level for associates who participate in the training program 
associates who do not participate in the training program receive only earned commissions until they meet the advancement qualification requiring them to produce new memberships in their organization in order to advance to the next compensation level and qualify for up to years commission advance 
commission advances prior to january the company advanced commissions at the time of sale of all new memberships 
in january  the company implemented a policy whereby the associate receives only earned commissions on the first three sales unless the associate has successfully completed the fast start training program that was implemented in for all sales beginning with the fourth membership or all sales made by an associate successfully completing the fast start training program  the company currently advances commissions at the time of sale of a new membership 
the amount of cash potentially advanced upon the sale of a new membership  prior to the recoupment of any charge backs described below  represents an amount equal to up to three years commission earnings 
although the average number of marketing associates receiving an advance commission payment on a new membership is  the overall initial advance may be paid to more than twenty five different individuals  each at a different level within the overall commission structure 
this commission advance immediately increases an associate s obligation to the company and represents a receivable from the associates 
although the company advances its sales associates up to three years commission when a membership is sold  the average commission advance paid to its sales associates as a group is actually less than years because some associates choose to receive less than a year advance and the company pays less than a year advance on some of its specialty products 
also  any residual commissions due an associate defined as commission on an individual membership after the advance has been earned is retained to reduce any remaining commission advance receivables prior to being paid to that sales associate 
the average commission advance in  and was  and years respectively 
commission advance receivable activity for years ended december   and is as follows in thousands beginning commission advance receivables    commission advances    recovery of advanced commissions    write offs  ending commission advance receivables    allowance for unrecoverable commission advance receivables    ending commission advance receivables  net commission advance receivables as of december   and are as follows in thousands active sales associates    d status sales associates    allowance for unrecoverable commission advance receivables    commission advance receivables  net projected commission earnings active sales associates    projected commission earnings d status sales associates    total projected earned commissions projected earned commissions commission advance receivables  net commissions are earned by and payable to the associate as membership premiums are earned  usually on a monthly basis 
the company reduces commission advance receivables or remits payment to an associate  as appropriate  when commissions are earned 
commission advance receivables on lapsed memberships are recovered through commission earnings on an associate s remaining active memberships or through a charge back mechanism 
should a membership lapse before the advances have been recovered for each commission level  the company generates an immediate charge back to the applicable sales associate to recapture up to of any unearned advance 
this charge back is deducted from any future advances that would otherwise be payable to the associate for additional new memberships 
any remaining commission advance receivable is recovered by withholding future residual earned commissions due an associate on active memberships 
additionally  even though a commission advance may have been fully recovered on a particular membership  no additional commission earnings from any membership are paid to an associate until all previous advances on all memberships  both active and lapsed  have been recovered 
the company charges associates a fee on commission advance receivables relating to lapsed memberships membership lapse fee 
the fee is determined by applying the prime interest rate to the commission advance receivable balance pertaining to lapsed memberships 
the company realizes and recognizes income only when the amount of the calculated fee is collected by withholding from cash commissions payments due the associate  because the company s ability to recover fees in excess of current payments is primarily dependant on the associate selling new memberships which qualify for commission advances 
the company has the contractual right to require associates to repay commission advance receivables from sources other than earned commissions including cash a from all associates either i upon termination of the associate relationship or ii when it is ascertained that earned commissions are insufficient to repay the advance receivables and b upon demand  from agencies or associates who are parties to the associate agreements signed between october and july or july to august  respectively 
the sources  other than earned commissions  that may be available to recover associate commission advance receivables are potentially subject to limitation based on applicable state laws relating to creditors rights generally 
historically  the company has not demanded repayments of the receivables from associates  including terminated associates  because in the aggregate the company s commission advance receivables have been substantially recovered from estimated future commission earnings  and collection efforts would likely increase costs and have the potential to disrupt the company s relationships with its sales associates 
however  the company regularly reviews the commission advance receivable status of associates and will exercise its right to require associates to repay advances when management believes that such action is appropriate 
d status associates are those that are no longer active because they fail to meet the company s established vesting requirements by selling at least three new memberships per quarter or retaining a personal membership 
d status associates lose their right to any further commissions earned on memberships previously sold at the time they are placed in d status 
as a result the company has no continuing obligation to individually account to these associates as it does to active associates and is entitled to retain all commission earnings that would be otherwise payable to these terminated associates 
the company does continue to reduce the advance commission receivables for commissions earned on active memberships previously sold by those associates 
d status commission advance receivables were million and million at december  and  respectively 
substantially all individual d status associate commission advance receivable balances were less than  and the average balance was at december  the company assesses  at the end of each quarter  on an associate by associate basis  the recoverability of each associate s commission advance receivable by estimating the associate s future commissions to be earned on active memberships 
each active membership is assumed to lapse in accordance with the company s estimated future lapse rate  which is based on the company s actual historical membership retention experience as applied to each active membership s year of origin 
the lapse rate is based on a year history of membership retention rates  which is updated quarterly to reflect actual experience 
the company also closely reviews current data for any trends that would affect the historical lapse rate 
the sum of all expected future commissions to be earned for each associate is then compared to that associate s commission advance receivable balance 
an allowance for unrecoverable commission advance receivables is recorded when expected future commissions to be earned on active memberships aggregated on an associate by associate basis are less than the commission advance receivable balance 
adjustments to the reserve are immediately recorded in income 
if an associate with an outstanding commission advance receivable has no active memberships  the advance is written off 
refer to measures of member retention expected economic life for a description of the method used by the company to estimate future commission earnings 
further  the company s analysis of the recoverability of advance commission receivables is also based on the assumption that the associate does not write any new memberships 
the company believes that this assessment methodology is highly conservative since its actual experience is that many associates do continue to sell new memberships and the company  through its chargeback rights  gains an additional source to recover advance commission receivables 
operating ratios three principal operating measures monitored by the company in addition to measures of membership retention are the membership benefit ratio  commission ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio 
the membership benefits ratio  the commissions ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio represent those costs as a percentage of membership fees 
the company strives to maintain these ratios as low as possible 
these ratios do not measure total profitability because they do not take into account all revenues and expenses 
cash flow considerations relating to sales of memberships the company generally advances significant commissions at the time a membership is sold 
since approximately of membership fees are collected on a monthly basis  a significant cash flow deficit is created at the time a membership is sold 
this deficit is reduced as monthly membership fees are remitted and no additional commissions are paid on the membership until all previous commission advance receivables have been fully recovered 
since the cash advanced at the time of sale of a new membership may be recovered over a multi year period  cash flow from operations may be adversely affected depending on the number of new memberships written in relation to the existing active base of memberships and the composition of new or existing sales associates producing such memberships 
income tax matters net operating losses the company has nols in the amount of million representing the remaining nols of tpn 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary ufl has an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward of  that does not expire 
a valuation allowance has been established for these carryforwards as the company does not believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these carryforwards and credits will be realized prior to expiration due in part to utilization restrictions imposed by section as discussed below 
the ability of the company to utilize nols and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future federal income taxes of the company is subject to various limitations under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
one such limitation is contained in section of the code which imposes an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation s taxable income that can be offset by those carryforwards in the event of a substantial change in ownership as defined in section ownership change 
in general  an ownership change occurs if during a specified three year period there are capital stock transactions that result in an aggregate change of more than in the beneficial ownership of the stock of the company 
however  the company does not have control over all possible variables which can affect the ownership change calculation and  accordingly  it is possible that an ownership change could occur in the future 
the effect of any such ownership change on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be determined because it is dependent upon unknown future facts and circumstances at the time of any such change  including  among others  the amount of any company s nols  the fair market value of the company s stock and the company s other tax attributes 
the acquisition of tpn by the company constituted an ownership change of tpn 
as a result  the ability of the company to utilize tpn s remaining million in nols is limited to approximately  per year 
although the company did not utilize any of the tpn nol during  it did fully utilize the available amount during and however  due to anticipated continuing growth and the expected availability of other tax benefits  the company does not believe it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of the tpn nol carryforward will be realized 
the tpn nol expires in years through associate services the company derives revenues from services provided to its marketing sales force from an enrollment fee of approximately from each new sales associate for which the company provides initial sales and marketing supplies and enrollment services to the associate 
in january  the company implemented a training program fast start that allows an associate who successfully completes the program to advance through the various commission levels at a faster rate 
associates participating in this program pay a fee of the fee covers the additional training and materials used in the training program and are recognized in income upon completion of the training 
the company enrolled  new sales associates during compared to  during and  during  resulting in significant increases in associate services revenues and costs 
associate services also includes revenue recognized on the sale of marketing supplies and promotional material to associates 
the company s costs of providing materials and services to associates are reflected as costs of associate services and direct marketing 
amounts collected from sales associates are intended primarily to offset the company s costs incurred in recruiting  training  monitoring and providing materials to sales associates and are not intended to generate profits from such activities 
tpn s revenues were primarily comprised of receipts for goods and services provided by tpn to its distributors and other customers 
distributors were required to purchase a distributor kit that included training materials and business support literature 
tpn distributors were required to meet certain sales production levels to be eligible to receive commissions and many distributors elected to purchase products through an automatic monthly bank or credit card draft 
these practices  which resulted in enhanced product sales  were discontinued in february insurance operations ufl retained its existing life insurance business as a part of the company s acquisition of ufl 
the life insurance operations of ufl generated approximately million in life insurance premiums and has continued to provide claims processing for the coinsured medicare supplement and health care policies and receive full cost reimbursement for such services from the coinsurer 
ufl markets primarily to individuals  age and over  in new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
product sales and product costs product sales consist primarily of the sale of personal and home care products  jewelry  books  audiocassettes and videotapes focusing on personal achievement 
other products and services include digital satellite television subscriptions  internet access and web sites  long distance and travel services provided by business partners 
the company has certain alliances with business partners  whereby sales associates buy products or services provided by such business partners and in return  the company receives commissions on the sales of such goods and services 
product costs consist primarily of the actual cost paid to acquire such goods and services 
costs to purchase products and deliver services are included in product costs 
product marketing activities have declined significantly over the last several years and represents less than of total revenues in the company expects future product sales and costs will be immaterial 
investment policy the company s investment policy is to some degree controlled by certain insurance regulations  which  coupled with management s own investment philosophy  results in a conservative investment portfolio that is not risk oriented 
the company s investments consist of common stocks  investment grade rated baa or higher preferred stocks and investment grade bonds primarily issued by corporations  the united states treasury  federal agencies  federally sponsored agencies and enterprises as well as mortgage backed securities and state and municipal tax exempt bonds 
the company is required to pledge investments to various state insurance departments as a condition to obtaining authority to do business in certain states 
disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheets include a certain amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risk 
due to the company s significant investment in fixed maturity investments  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
as of december   substantially all of the company s investments were in investment grade rated baa or higher fixed maturity investments and interest bearing money market accounts 
the company does not hold any investments classified as trading account assets or derivative financial instruments 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly  with no effect given to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best and worst case scenarios 
the fair values shown in the following table are based on contractual maturities 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the following table estimated fair value after hypothetical hypothetical change in interest change in fair value at rate interest december  bp basis points rate dollars in thousands fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  fixed maturity investments at december   bp increase  bp increase  bp decrease  bp decrease  excluding short term investments with a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the table above illustrates  for example  that an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates at december  would reduce the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
at december   and based on the fair value of fixed maturity investments of million  an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the estimated fair value of the company s fixed maturity investments by approximately million at that date 
the company s decreased sensitivity to rising interest rates is due to the reduction of investments with maturities over ten years 
the definitive extent of the interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rate risk by purchasing investments that can be readily liquidated should the interest rate environment begin to significantly change 
accounting standard to be adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas was issued in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which amends certain provisions of sfas to clarify four areas causing difficulties in implementation 
the amendment included expanding the normal purchase and sale exemption for supply contracts  permitting the offsetting of certain foreign currency derivatives and thus reducing the number of third party derivatives  permitting hedge fund accounting for foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  and redefining interest rate risk to reduce sources of ineffectiveness 
sfas  as amended  applies to all entities and is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas  as amended  on january  as required 
the company did not hold any derivative instruments at january  and there was no effect on the consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of sfas sec staff accounting bulletin no

measures of member retention one of the major factors affecting the company s profitability and cash flow is the ability of the company to retain a membership  and therefore continue to receive fees  once it has been written 
the company monitors its overall membership persistency rate  as well as the persistency rates with respect to memberships sold by individual associates and agents and persistency rates with respect to membership sales by year of issue  geographic region and payment method 
the company has historically disclosed its membership persistency data as described below under membership persistency 
certain other measures of membership retention are described below together with an explanation of their potential use and limitations 
membership persistency the company s membership persistency rate measures the number of memberships in force at the end of a year as a percentage of the total of i memberships in force at the beginning of such year  plus ii new memberships sold during such year 
from through the year ended december   the company s annual membership persistency rates  using the foregoing method  have averaged approximately 
the annual membership persistency rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the company s overall membership persistency rate varies based on  among other factors  the relative age of total memberships in force 
the company s overall membership persistency rate could become lower when the memberships in force include a higher proportion of newer memberships 
during the last three years  the company has experienced significant increases in new membership sales and  as a result  the percentage of newer memberships in its total memberships in force has increased 
unless offset by other factors  this increase could result in a decline in the company s overall membership persistency rate as determined by the formula described above  but does not necessarily indicate that the new memberships written are less persistent  only that the ratio of new memberships to total memberships is higher than it averaged during the through period 
the company s financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if the persistency rates of existing and new memberships become materially lower than the company s historical experience 
expected economic life since the company s membership persistency  as defined above  is influenced by the relative age of total memberships in force  it will be influenced by changes in new member enrollment rates 
there are other measures of retention that are independent of these variations in past enrollment rates 
one such measure is the expected economic life of a new member 
this is the average number of years that a new member is expected to continue to renew  computed based on observed historical data 
the following chart sets forth as of december  the company s overall membership retention rates under the expected economic life method based on our actual experience over the last years for example  of members were still paying year after those members purchased a membership 
of those who were still paying year after purchasing a membership  were still paying years after purchasing a membership 
thus  years after purchasing a membership  remain as paying members  etc 
membership retention yearly end of year average year retention members members using these data  the expected economic life of a new member is computed to be years 
note that this number is based on more than years of historical membership retention data  unlike membership persistency which is computed from and determined by the most recent one year period only 
the expected economic life of a new member may be useful for estimating the expected future stream of revenues from a large pool of new members 
this membership retention data is used by the company to estimate recoverability of commission advance receivables provided to associates 
the fact that the expected economic life of a new member is greater than the maximum commission advance of years is important to ensure the collectibility of commission advance receivables 
average member life a third measure of persistency  commonly used by actuaries for comparing the longevity of renewable membership services  such as subscriptions  life insurance services  etc 
is the average member life 
it is based on a model that assumes that a fixed number of new members have been historically enrolled in each previous year  so that the distribution of actual lifetimes of the members in force mirrors the membership retention rates described above 
expected lifetime value years paid x average average year members members totals a  b expected membership lifetime value b a years of revenue using this data  if a fixed number of members had been enrolled in each of the past twenty years  the current average member life of active members would be years 
note that this is a model distribution for comparison purposes only 
since membership enrollment rates have grown significantly over the years  the company s actual membership population is weighted more heavily by recent new enrollments  hence the average age of the current membership population will be lower than this number 
it should be noted that the average member life may be useful for comparison for the company s member longevity versus other services  since it is not affected by historical new enrollment rates or rates of growth  which may vary between services being compared 
it is not directly useful for nor is it used by the company in any way to assess risks and required reserves for uncollectible commission advance receivables  or any other financial factor 
expected remaining economic life since the company s experience is that the retention rate of a given generation of new members improves with time since first enrollment  the expected remaining economic life of a member also increases with time since first enrollment 
for example  while the expected economic life of a new member just enrolled is years  the expected remaining economic life of a member that has already renewed for one year is about years 
since the actual population of members in force at year end is a distribution of ages from zero to over years  the expected remaining economic life of the entire population at large exceeds years per member 
as of december   based on the historical data described above  the current expected remaining economic life of the actual population is approximately years results of operations comparison of to the company reported net income applicable to common shares of million  or per diluted common share  for after a current year after tax charge of million relating to the cumulative effect on prior years of changing the accounting for membership commission advance receivables as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net income per diluted share was up from net income applicable to common shares of million  or per diluted common share  for the increase in the net income applicable to common shares for is primarily the result of increases in membership fees for as compared to membership fees totaled million during compared to million for  an increase of 
membership fees and their impact on total revenues in any period are determined directly by the number of active memberships in force during any such period 
the active memberships in force are determined by both the number of new memberships sold in any period together with the renewal rate of existing memberships 
new membership sales increased during to  from  during at december   there were  active memberships in force compared to  at december   an increase of 
additionally  the average annual fee per membership has increased from for all memberships in force at december  to for all memberships in force at december   a increase  as a result of a higher portion of active memberships containing the additional pre trial hours benefit at an additional cost to the member together with increased sales of the business owners legal solutions plan 
product sales declined during to million from million in primarily due to the concentration on membership sales as opposed to the sale of goods and services following the tpn acquisition 
product sales are expected to be immaterial in and future periods as the company no longer encourages product sales 
associate services revenue increased from million for to million during as a result of more new associates recruited and as a result of fast start which resulted in the company receiving training fees of approximately million during compared to million during the field training program  titled fast start to success fast start is aimed at increasing the level of new membership sales per associate 
fast start requires a training fee of per new associate and upon successful completion of the program provides for the payment of certain training bonuses 
in order to be deemed successful for fast start purposes  the new associate must write three new memberships and recruit three new sales associates or personally sell five memberships within days of becoming an associate

the company s year end active memberships have increased  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income applicable to common stockholders for the same three years have increased  and  respectively 
the company s ability to grow memberships and earnings is substantially dependent upon its ability to expand or enhance the productivity of its sales force  develop additional legal expense products  develop alternative marketing methods or expand geographically

while the company believes that its accounting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in all material respects  there can be no assurance that the sec will agree with the company s position 
the company s change in accounting principle for evaluating recoverability of commission advance receivables from terminated associates has not been reviewed by the staff of the sec and there is no assurance that they will concur with this change 
if the sec s inquiries are resolved adversely to the company  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and stock price 
the company is in a regulated industry and regulations could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to conduct its business 
the company is regulated by or required to file with or obtain approval of state insurance departments  state bar associations and state attorney general s offices  depending on individual state positions regarding regulatory responsibility for prepaid legal expense plans 
regulation of the company s activities is inconsistent among the various states in which the company does business with some states regulating legal expense plans as insurance or specialized legal expense products and others regulating such plans as services 
such disparate regulation requires the company to structure its memberships and operations differently in certain states in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations 
the company s multi level marketing strategy is also subject to us federal  canadian provincial and us state regulation under laws relating to consumer protection  pyramid sales  business opportunity  lotteries and multi level marketing

see description of business competition 
the company is dependent upon the success of its marketing force 
the company s principal method of product distribution is through multi level marketing 
the success of a multi level marketing force is highly dependent upon the company s ability to offer a commission and organizational structure and sales training and incentive program that enable sales associates to recruit and develop other sales associates to create a downline 
there are a number of other products and services that use multi level marketing as a distribution method and the company must compete with these organizations to recruit  maintain and grow its multi level marketing force 
in order to do so  the company may be required to increase its marketing costs through increases in commissions  sales incentives or other features  all of which could adversely affect the company s future earnings 
in addition  the level of confidence of the sales associates in the company s ability to perform is an important factor in maintaining and growing a multi level marketing force 
adverse financial developments concerning the company  including negative publicity or common stock price declines  could adversely affect the ability of the company to maintain the confidence of its sales force
