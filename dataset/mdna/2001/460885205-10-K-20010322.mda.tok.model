liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  and  respectively at december  and december  igc historically has met its liquidity requirements principally from cash flow generated from home and land sales  distributions from residential rental partnerships  loans from affiliates  and from bank financing providing funds for development and working capital 
in the coming months  the company s principal need for liquidity will be normal business operating expenses  development costs for iwt and cwt  land development activities  cash requirements for afh s wind down  cessation of operations and continuing warranty costs  and ongoing debt service of existing loans 
igc s long term success depends on iwt cwt s development of solid waste projects 
these efforts require substantial capital 
the company intends to use proceeds from the sale of its real estate holdings to finance all or a portion of the development of solid waste projects 
it is not likely that the company will generate near term revenues from real estate sales sufficient to cover general and administrative expenses plus the costs of developing its solid waste projects 
it will be at least december before a financial close could occur on any of iwt cwt s waste projects 
moreover  there is no assurance financial closing will occur on any given project 
as a result  the company must continue to borrow using its real estate assets as collateral to meet liquidity needs 
for example  during the third quarter  the company closed a million line of credit secured by various real estate parcels 
in addition  the company anticipates relying on the collection of principal and interest relating to a note receivable from an affiliate of acpt over the remainder of the year 
these collections will either be directly from that affiliate or as additional advances from ibc as more fully discussed below 
the company is aggressively marketing its real estate portfolio 
management is in negotiations with potential purchasers on several of its largest parcels 
there is no assurance a sale will be consummated or when any particular property will be sold 
during  afh continued to lose money requiring substantial cash infusions to meet operating needs 
the board of directors of igc approved a plan to wind down and cease the operations of afh following completion of all existing homes under construction 
fourteen homes remained under construction at year end 
accordingly  the results of operations for afh are reported as discontinued operations 
the company estimates that it will incur a loss of  in closing down afh 
through december   the company incurred  of this amount 
a provision for the remaining estimated loss has been included under results from discontinued operations 
refer to note on page for further information 
termination of afh s homebuilding business will reduce operating losses and the cash burden on the company 
it will also enable management to focus on real estate development and waste development activities 
the waste disposal plant development operations of iwt cwt are subject to municipal and other government bidding procedures  contract award  permitting  and other approvals 
a number of proposals by iwt cwt to build waste disposal plants in the caribbean and elsewhere are in various stages of the approval process 
cwt is currently pursuing a project in the municipality of caguas  puerto rico  where it previously signed a host community agreement 
in november  the company announced that its proposed facility received a certificate of conformity from the puerto rico solid waste management authority 
this will allow cwt to begin contracting and other activities necessary to implement the project 
the next steps will be to obtain all necessary regulatory permits and licenses and begin discussions with the solid waste management authority  other involved governmental agencies  and municipalities to be served by the facility 
cwt then expects to negotiate long term contracts for the delivery of solid waste and payment for its processing services 
the target date for completion of all of these activities is the first quarter of there can be no assurance that cwt will be able to reach agreement on contracts necessary to build and operate this facility or  if it does  that the contracts will be on terms which will allow cwt to go to financial closing 
the government of the us virgin islands informed cwt on november  that it had been selected to negotiate contracts to build one or more facilities to process the island s solid waste 
cwt has begun negotiations with government officials and their advisors 
industry experience suggests that contracting and permitting could take approximately nine months to one year 
cwt will work closely with the virgin islands government to obtain required permits  structure the project to get to financial close  and begin construction expeditiously 
while cwt believes these negotiations will be successful  there can be no assurance this will be so or that terms can be agreed upon which will allow the project to go to financial closing 
management cannot predict when  if at all  iwt cwt will generate positive cash flow 
a balance due from an affiliate of acpt totaled million at march  during the second quarter of  the company collected million of principal and interest on this note leaving a balance at december  of million 
in the meantime  ibc  igc s general partner  has signed a working capital support agreement with igc secured by igc s interest in this note receivable 
as of december   ibc and its affiliates had advanced million including interest 
subsequent to the end of the year  ibc advanced an additional  under this agreement 
ibc has expressed a willingness to advance funds under this support agreement in excess of the note securing the advances 
however  there is no assurance that ibc and its affiliates will be able to continue to fund igc 
neither ibc nor its affiliates generate sufficient cash flow from operations to advance the capital necessary to fund the needs of igc 
the ability of ibc and its affiliates to advance cash to igc is dependent upon the ability to successfully close the sale or refinancing of certain assets 
management believes that the company s real estate assets have sufficient value to enable the company to finance development with conventional financing 
the company currently has development loans in place for its projects at brandywine and the first section of phase at westbury 
during  of lots at montclair were sold and the development financing repaid in full 
in addition  single family lots were sold in the westbury and dorchester projects 
infrastructure development activity is continuing in brandywine 
the company is presently negotiating with several homebuilders and expects the first lot sales to occur in the second quarter of town center south in st 
charles  maryland remains the most valuable real estate asset the company holds and management is aggressively marketing it 
igc intends to continue to refinance loans as they become due in the normal course of business 
debts totaling  mature during the company has already obtained a commitment for a six month extension of its million operating line of credit  which is included in the preceding amount 
the remainder of these loans relate to various real estate development ventures 
the company expects to fulfill these obligations through related property sales 
management believes that it will have the funds necessary to meet the company s obligations for the balance of the year 
while the company believes it will obtain financing for continued land development and operational activities beyond the current year  there is no guarantee such financing will be available
