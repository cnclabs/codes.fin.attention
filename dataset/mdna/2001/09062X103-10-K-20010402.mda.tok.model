item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are primarily engaged in the commercialization  research and development of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
in december  the fda accepted our filing of a bla seeking marketing approval for zevalin 
we have retained all us marketing and distribution rights to zevalin and have granted marketing and distribution rights outside the us to schering ag 
in january  the european medicines evaluation agency accepted for filing the zevalin marketing authorization application submitted by schering ag in the european union 
in november  we received fda approval to market our first product  rituxan  in the united states 
in june  roche  our european marketing partner  was granted marketing authorization for rituximab in all european union countries 
in september  zenyaku  our japanese marketing partner for rituxan  submitted a bla equivalent for rituxan with the ministry of health and welfare for japan  which is currently pending approval in japan 
rituxan is the trade name in the united states and japan for the compound rituximab 
outside the united states  rituximab is marketed as mabthera 
in this management s discussion and analysis section  we refer to rituximab  rituxan and mabthera collectively as rituxan  except where we have otherwise indicated 
rituxan is being copromoted in the united states under a joint business arrangement with genentech  where we receive a share of the pretax copromotion profits 
under the copromotion arrangement we share responsibility with genentech for selling and continued development of rituxan in the united states 
continued development of rituxan includes conducting supportive research on rituxan  post approval clinical studies and obtaining approval of rituxan for potential additional indications 
genentech provides the support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the united states including marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
since september  genentech has been responsible for all worldwide manufacturing 
under the terms of separate agreements with genentech  commercialization of rituxan outside the united states is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where zenyaku will be responsible for product development  marketing and sales 
we receive royalties on rituxan sales outside the united states 
our revenues include revenues from unconsolidated joint business  contract revenues and license fees 
until the commercialization of rituxan  a substantial portion of our revenues had been derived from contract revenues and license fees 
however  since the commercialization of rituxan in november  our revenues have depended primarily upon the sale of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business include our share of the pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  revenue from bulk rituxan sales to genentech through march  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalty revenue from roche on sales of rituximab outside the united states 
revenue from bulk rituxan sales was recognized when genentech accepted the bulk rituxan 
we record our royalty revenue from roche with a one quarter lag 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our collaborative agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage at the beginning of the second quarter of in  we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the second quarter 
contract revenues include nonrefundable research and development funding under collaborative agreements with our strategic partners and other funding under contractual arrangements with other parties 
contract research and development funding generally compensates us for discovery  preclinical and clinical expenses related to our collaborative development programs for our products and is recognized at the time research and development activities are performed under the terms of the collaborative agreements 
license fees include nonrefundable fees from product development milestone payments  the sale of license rights to our proprietary gene expression technology and nonrefundable fees from the sale of product rights under collaborative development and license agreements with our strategic partners 
nonrefundable up front fees from the sale of product rights are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue over future periods 
included in license fees are nonrefundable product development milestone payments which are recognized upon the achievement of product development milestone objectives as stipulated in agreements with our strategic partners 
product development milestone objectives vary in each of our agreements 
the achievement of product development milestone objectives that may lead to the recognition of license fee revenues include o the achievement of preclinical research and development objectives  o the initiation of various phases of clinical trials  o the filing of an ind application  bla or nda  o the filing of drug license applications in foreign territories  and o obtaining united states or foreign regulatory product approvals 
contract revenues and license fees may vary from year to year and are in part dependent upon achievement of research and development objectives or the consummation of new corporate alliances 
the magnitude and timing of contract revenues and license fees may influence our achievement and level of profitability 
the cost of bulk rituxan sold to genentech was recorded as manufacturing costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
under our agreement with genentech  the sales price of bulk rituxan sold to genentech was capped at a price that was less than our cost to manufacture bulk rituxan 
in september  we transferred all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech 
since the transfer of bulk rituxan manufacturing to genentech in september  we have been using our manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and pre commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
during the first quarter of  we completed the bla enabling bulk manufacturing runs of the antibody component for zevalin 
we have incurred increasing annual operating expenses and  with the commercialization of rituxan and preparation for potential commercialization of zevalin  we expect such trends to continue 
since our inception in  through  we incurred annual operating losses 
our ongoing profitability will be dependent upon the continued commercial success of rituxan  product development  revenues from the achievement of product development objectives and licensing transactions 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
results of operations revenues from unconsolidated joint business revenues from unconsolidated joint business in totaled million compared to million in and million in revenues from unconsolidated joint business for the years ended december   and  consist of the following table in thousands copromotion profits    bulk rituxan sales    reimbursement of selling and development expenses    royalty revenue on sales of rituximab outside the us    during the first quarter of  we recognized the remaining revenues and related manufacturing costs from bulk rituxan sales to genentech 
going forward  the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities to genentech will result in the loss of revenues to offset our manufacturing costs 
the loss of bulk rituxan revenues may be offset by the potential financial and development timeline benefits of manufacturing the zevalin antibody and other proteins to support our clinical programs in our manufacturing facility 
under our agreement with genentech  our pretax copromotion profit sharing formula has two tiers 
we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage at the beginning of the second quarter of in  we began recording our profit share at the higher percentage during the second quarter as compared to the third quarter in rituxan net sales to third party customers in the united states recorded by genentech for amounted to million compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhl and a five percent increase in the wholesale price of rituxan in may the increase in was also primarily due to increased market penetration in treatments of b cell nhl and a five percent increase in the wholesale price of rituxan in september contract revenues contract revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in contract revenues in was primarily the result of funding under a collaboration and license agreement with schering ag and a collaborative research and development agreement with taisho  offset by the decreased funding under a collaborative agreement with eisai 
the decrease in contract revenues in resulted primarily from decreased funding under collaborative agreements with eisai  seikagaku and smithkline beecham  offset by increased funding under a collaboration and license agreement with schering ag 
license fees license fees totaled million in compared to million in and million in license fees in consist solely of revenue that was previously recognized in  see cumulative effect of accounting change 
license fees in consist primarily of a million up front licensing fee from shering ag for the development and commercialization of zevalin outside the united states 
license fees in consist of a million product development milestone payment from genentech for european approval of rituxan  a million license fee from kirin brewery co  ltd  pharmaceuticals division for the license of our proprietary gene expression technology and a product development milestone payment for the ind allowance of idec  an investigational primatized anti b monoclonal antibody for the treatment of psoriasis  under our collaboration with mitsubishi tokyo pharmaceuticals  inc contract revenues and license fees may vary from year to year and are  in part  dependent upon achievement of research and development objectives 
the magnitude and timing of contract revenues and license fees may influence our achievement and level of profitability 
we continue to pursue other collaborative and license arrangements  however  no assurance can be given that any such arrangements will be realized 
manufacturing costs manufacturing costs totaled million in compared to million in and million in our manufacturing costs relate to production of bulk rituxan sold to genentech 
manufacturing costs were recognized when genentech accepted the bulk rituxan inventory 
the decrease in manufacturing costs for and is due to the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech in september the final lots of bulk rituxan manufactured by us during the third quarter of were accepted by genentech during the first quarter of since the transfer of all worldwide manufacturing responsibilities for bulk rituxan to genentech  we have been using our manufacturing capacity for production of specification setting lots and pre commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
those manufacturing expenses have been recorded as research and development expenses 
research and development research and development expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in is primarily due to zevalin related manufacturing and process development expenses  technology in licensing and expansion of our facilities 
the increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to increased personnel expenses and zevalin related clinical trials  process development and manufacturing scale up expenses  offset in part by decreased contract manufacturing by third parties and other outside service contracts 
we expect to continue incurring substantial manufacturing related expenses as we have begun using our manufacturing capacity for production of pre commercial inventory of zevalin antibodies and production of other proteins for clinical trials 
in the future we expect to continue incurring substantial additional research and development expenses due to o completion of our primary development program for zevalin  o the expansion or addition of research and development programs  o technology in licensing  o regulatory related expenses  o facilities expansion  and o preclinical and clinical testing of our various products under development 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased legal and patent filing fees and increases in sales and marketing expenses resulting from the commercialization of rituxan 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses resulting from the commercialization of rituxan 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the foreseeable future to support the following o expanded growth of our sales force  o marketing and administration related to the potential commercialization of zevalin  o manufacturing capacity  o clinical trials  and o research and development 
interest income expense interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in is primarily due to higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulting from the sale of million shares of common stock in november  cash provided by operations and cash provided from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
the increase in interest income in is due to higher average balances in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale resulting from the completion of a zero coupon convertible notes  or notes  offering in february  see liquidity and capital resources  cash provided by operations and cash provided from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
interest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest expense in and is primarily due to noncash interest charges relating to the notes offering in february interest expense is expected to increase in the future due to noncash interest charges from the notes 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to five percent in and two percent in our effective tax rate for resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and the reduction of the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate for resulted from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
our net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income at december  were approximately million for federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate this annual limitation to result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we expect that our effective tax rate in the future will be closer to the maximum statutory tax rate 
cumulative effect of accounting change in the fourth quarter of  we implemented the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 effective as of january  sab no 
established new guidelines in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides that nonrefundable up front fees received under collaborative agreements be recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue over future periods 
prior to the implementation of sab no 
 we recognized certain nonrefundable up front fees upon receipt as license fee revenue 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change on years prior to resulted in a charge of million net of a million income tax effect  that was reflected effectively in the first quarter of  of which million was recognized as license fee revenue during and million was recorded as deferred revenue as of december  this accounting change is directly related to the million up front license fee received from schering ag and recognized as license fee revenue in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital expenditures since inception principally through the sale of equity securities  commercialization of rituxan  license fees  contract revenues  lease financing transactions  debt and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  funds from our copromotion arrangement with genentech and with funds from existing collaborative agreements and contracts which we believe will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
existing collaborative research agreements and contracts  however  could be canceled by the contracting parties 
in addition  we may  from time to time seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be obtained through these sources on acceptable terms  if at all 
should we not enter into any such arrangements  we anticipate our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  together with the existing agreements and contracts and cash generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  will be sufficient to finance our currently anticipated needs for operating and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
if adequate funds are not available from the copromotion arrangement  operations or additional sources of financing  our business could be harmed 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including o the continued commercial success of rituxan  o the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  o fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  o timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals  o levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the potential commercial launch of zevalin  o technological advances  o status of competitors  and o our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
until required for operations  we invest our cash reserves in bank deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate notes  united states government instruments and other readily marketable debt instruments in accordance with our investment policy 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale compared to million at december  sources of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million from operations  million  net of underwritting commissions and expenses of million from the sale of million shares of common stock in november and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock option and purchase plans 
uses of cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale during the year ended december  included million used to purchase property and capital equipment and million used to pay notes payable 
in september  we purchased a acre site in oceanside for approximately million in cash 
we plan to build a large scale manufacturing facility at the location  which we anticipate using to commercialize our products currently in clinical trials 
additional costs we expect to incur in connection with this facility include design  development and construction costs  as well as the purchase and installation of equipment and furnishings for the facility 
we estimate these costs at to million over a four year period 
we expect to pay for these costs in part through our existing cash on hand and in part from our working capital 
we presently intend to finance this facility through a structured financing which will likely involve using cash on hand as collateral 
in  we begun preliminary site preparations for the first phase of development  which is anticipated to be approximately  square feet 
the first phase of the new facility in oceanside is anticipated to be completed in early we expect the facility to be operating by the end of this expansion will allow us to better control the manufacture of our products  reducing our reliance on contract manufacturers  as well as to reduce commercial risk 
in february  we raised through the sale of notes approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses of million 
the notes are zero coupon and were priced with a yield to maturity of percent annually 
upon maturity  the notes will have an aggregate principal face value of million 
each  aggregate principal face value note is convertible at the holders option at any time through maturity into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
we are required under the terms of the notes  as of business days after a change in control occurring on or before february   to purchase any note at the option of its holder at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase 
additionally  the holders of the notes may require us to purchase the notes on february   or at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the date of purchase with us having the option to repay the notes plus accrued original issue discount in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
we have the right to redeem the notes on or after february  in september  we entered into a development and license agreement with cpi 
under the terms of the development and license agreement with cpi  we may make payments to cpi totaling up to million plus a share of future royalty and development milestone payments received by us from third parties  subject to attainment of product development milestone objectives  of which million has been paid through december  in october  we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with smithkline beecham related to the development and commercialization of compounds based on our primatized anti cd antibodies 
in february  we amended and restated our agreement with smithkline beecham which resulted in all anti cd program rights  including those for idec  being returned to us 
we will receive no further funding from smithkline beecham under the restated agreement 
as part of the restated agreement  smithkline beecham has the option to negotiate commercialization and copromotion rights with us for the first compound based on our primatized anti cd antibodies to complete a phase ii study 
if we do not commercialize and copromote the compound with smithkline beecham  we will pay smithkline beecham royalties on sales and licensees by us or our affiliates on products emerging from the rights returned to us under the restated agreement 
additionally  we had future minimum lease payment obligations under our operating leases of million as of december  new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or statement no 
as amended by financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities and financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
statement no 
 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities with the instruments measured at fair value and is effective on january  the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
the adoption of statement no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and the cost of our debt 
at december   we maintained a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
we also maintained a short term investment portfolio containing financial instruments in which the majority have original maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and to a lesser extent foreign and us government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates during the year ended december   would have resulted in approximately a million change in pretax income 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our long term debt totaled million at december  and was comprised principally of the notes 
our long term debt obligations bear interest at a weighed average interest rate of 
due to the fixed rate nature of the notes  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price or an increase in interest rates which may make conversion of the notes to common stock beneficial to the notes holder 
conversion of the notes would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and book value per common share
