this revenue increase was attributable to revenue from stone webster businesses  which were acquired in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues from the manufacturing and distribution segment increased million  or  from fiscal levels to million for fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased revenues 
the company s sales to customers in the following geographic regions approximated the following amounts and percentages geographic region fiscal fiscal in millions in millions united states  asia pacific rim europe other south america middle east 

revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to  million for fiscal the power generation market continues to be robust in the us  accounting for approximately million of the increase in domestic sales for fiscal these increases were made possible primarily by the stone webster acquisition 
further  as a result of the acquisition of stone webster  the company now conducts business in the environmental and infrastructure industry sector 
domestic sales to this industry sector increased by million for the year ended august  the increases in the domestic power generation and environmental and infrastructure domestic sectors were partially offset by decreases in domestic process work 
domestic process industries sector sales decreased million primarily due to decreases of sales to the refining industry 
the company s domestic power generation customers continue to express interest in new orders for gas power plants and also for coal and nuclear projects 
no significant increases are expected in the process markets in fiscal due to reduced capital expenditures by the company s customers in these markets 
sales for international projects increased million  or  to million from fiscal to fiscal sales in the asia pacific rim region and europe increased from prior year s levels primarily due to work performed by the acquired stone webster businesses 
additionally  in fiscal  the company finalized an agreement for the construction of a  metric tons per year ethylene plant in china  which will significantly impact sales in this area through fiscal even though sales for south america and the middle east regions have remained sluggish  the company continues to believe that these markets present long term opportunities to the company 
the company s sales to customers in the following industries approximated the following amounts and percentages industry sector fiscal fiscal in millions in millions power generation process industries environmental and infrastructure other industries revenues from both domestic and international power generation projects increased by a total of million in fiscal from fiscal demand in the united states for power generation projects remained high  and was responsible for of the power generation revenue increase 
the acquisition of stone webster has enabled the company to capitalize on the increase in demand to construct power generation plants 
the decrease in process industries sales in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from reductions in domestic refining work 
additionally  the stone webster acquisition resulted in the addition of the environmental and infrastructure industry sector to the company s capabilities 
gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to the growth in revenue volume during the year 
the company s gross profit in fiscal was increased cost of sales decreased by approximately million by the utilization of reserves which were established to record the fair value of primarily fixed price contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company increased the gross margin reserve and its reserve for contract losses for contracts acquired from stone webster by million and million  respectively 
these increases were made to finalize the company s purchase accounting fair value assessment of the related acquired contracts in progress and primarily reflected a customer s decision to recommence a large foreign nuclear project which had been suspended and to adjust the reserves of certain other contracts based on a current evaluation of their status as of the acquisition date 
these reserve adjustments increased goodwill recorded for the acquisition 
the gross profit margin percentage for the year ended august  decreased to from from the prior year 
the company is involved in numerous projects  and  as a result  the company s consolidated gross profit margin can be affected by many factors 
these include matters  such as product mix eg  engineering and consulting versus construction and procurement  pricing strategies  foreign versus domestic work profit margins differ  sometimes substantially  depending on the location of the work and adjustments to project profit estimates during the project term 
during fiscal  stone webster s operating results were included in the company s consolidated financial statements for the entire year as compared to only one and one half months in fiscal epc contracts  such as those that stone webster worked on during fiscal  typically have lower gross profit margin percentages than the company s historical gross profit margin percentages 
these contracts were a contributing factor to the lower gross profit margin percentage in fiscal as compared with fiscal additionally  during fiscal  as compared with prior periods  the company entered into more cost reimbursable contracts as opposed to fixed price projects 
cost reimbursable contracts generally allow the company to recover any cost overruns 
accordingly  cost reimbursable contracts are frequently priced with lower gross margins than fixed price contracts  because fixed priced contracts are usually bid with higher margins to compensate for cost overrun risks 
the company expects that a substantial portion of its work in fiscal and fiscal will be performed pursuant to cost reimbursable contracts 
the company expects that gross profit margin percentages will be lower in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due  in large part  to the following factors a increase in engineering  procurement and construction work  which carries lower margin percentages than pipe fabrication work  b additional epc contracts requiring the procurement of large pieces of equipment  and c increase in the amount of work to be performed pursuant to cost reimbursable contracts  which contracts generally carry lower margins than fixed price contracts such as some of the contracts assumed in the stone webster acquisition 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses  which include goodwill amortization  increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from i expenses associated with the stone webster businesses and ii an approximate million increase in goodwill amortization  also resulting primarily from the stone webster acquisition 
however  as a result of economies realized with the integration of stone webster into shaw  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased as a percentage of sales to from compared with fiscal the company expects general and administrative expenses  excluding goodwill amortization  to increase in fiscal  but at a substantially lesser rate than its percentage growth in revenues 
additionally  the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective at september  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  and will cease amortizing goodwill for fiscal and future periods as required by this new accounting standard 
the company s goodwill amortization for fiscal was approximately million 
in may  the company realized approximately million net proceeds after offering expenses from the issuance and sale of million of year  zero coupon  unsecured  convertible debt liquid yield option tm notes the lyons due the lyons were issued on an original discount basis of per lyon  providing the holders with a yield to maturity of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company used these proceeds to retire the majority of its outstanding borrowings and to invest surplus funds in investments with yields higher than the interest on the debt 
interest expense for the year increased to million from million in fiscal year this increase was largely attributable to higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates on the company s primary revolving line of credit facility during fiscal prior to the sale of the lyons in may interest expense was favorably impacted in fiscal and by excluding approximately million and million  respectively  of interest expense attributable to the operations of a cold storage operation reported as an asset held for sale 
the company s interest expense for fiscal  and for future periods  includes the amortization of loan origination costs for both its revolving credit facility and its lyons debt  and therefore  its reported interest expense is and will be higher than expected  based on its borrowing levels 
other income was million for fiscal compared with 
million for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to interest income realized from investments in high quality  short term debt instruments 
the funds for these investments were primarily provided from the net proceeds after retiring other outstanding debt from the sale of the company s convertible debt instruments in may see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the yields from these investments were greater than the interest costs associated with the convertible debt 
the company s interest expense will increase in fiscal from fiscal as a result of having convertible debt outstanding for the full fiscal year 
interest income should increase in fiscal over fiscal levels due to the company s investment of a substantial portion of the funds received from the sale of its convertible debt 
however  the company anticipates that  based on its current cash flow and yield projections  interest income will be less than its interest expense in fiscal the company s effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
the company s tax rates for each period during each year represent the company s estimate of its effective tax rates for each entire year based primarily on the company s estimate of pretax income for the year and the mix of domestic and foreign sourced including foreign export sales income 
the company updates its effective tax rate each quarter based on actual results to date and revised budgeted amounts for the remainder of the year 
the increase in the tax rates in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to the increase in domestic sales and an increase in nondeductible expenses  such as a portion of the goodwill recognized from the stone webster acquisition 
however  because the company has adopted sfas no 
in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it will cease to amortize goodwill 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its effective tax rate will decrease in fiscal because it will no longer recognize goodwill amortization expense which is only partially deductible for tax purposes in its financial statements 
this decrease is expected to be partially offset by increased domestic income in fiscal that has a higher tax rate than most foreign income 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal revenues from both of the company s business segments increased from fiscal levels with the integrated epc services formerly named pipe services segment reflecting a million increase or

revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal increases were experienced in all domestic industry sectors  with power generation sales accounting for the majority of the increase 
revenues from international projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal all international industry sectors reflected sales increases over fiscal amounts  with the primary increases being in crude oil refining revenues part of the process industries sector and the power generation sector 
for the year ended august   virtually all european sector sales were to the united kingdom 
sales increased in the asia pacific rim region due to work performed by the acquired stone webster businesses 
additionally  in august  the company executed a letter of intent for the construction of a  metric ton per year ethylene plant in china

other industries sales include revenues from the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which in prior years was reported separately 
revenues from power generation projects increased both domestically and internationally 
sales related to domestic power projects increased due to additional work performed for united states customers  including a million  five year contract with a major manufacturer of gas turbines 
international power generation revenue increases resulted from work performed by the newly acquired stone webster businesses 
process industries sector sales also increased both domestically and internationally over revenues  principally due to sales to the crude oil refining industry 
environmental and infrastructure sales were primarily domestic and were generated by the newly acquired stone webster businesses 
the gross profit margin for the year ended august   decreased to from for the same period the prior year 
the company is involved in numerous projects  all of which affect gross profit in various ways  such as product mix  pricing strategies  foreign versus domestic work profit margins differ  sometimes substantially  depending on where the work is performed  and constant monitoring of percentage of completion calculations 
the company s gross profit margin has been declining due to the company s increase in revenues related to its erection and maintenance services and the inclusion of stone webster s procurement and construction activities  which generally carry lower margins than fabrication work 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase resulted from stone webster activity since the acquisition 
the remaining increase resulted primarily from higher sales levels and other normal business expenses 
as a percentage of sales  however  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended august  from for the year ended august  interest expense for the year ended august  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
interest expense varies from year to year due to the level of borrowings and interest rate fluctuations on variable rate loans 
prior to the stone webster acquisition and a new primary credit facility obtained in july see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  interest expense on the company s previous line of credit had decreased approximately million in fiscal year  compared to the same period in fiscal  due to lower borrowings partially offset by higher interest rates 
borrowings after the stone webster acquisition on the new credit facility added approximately million of additional interest costs in fiscal the remaining million decrease relates to paydowns of debt  offset by interest on assumed stone webster debt 
the company s effective tax rates for the years ended august  and were and  respectively 
the increase in the tax rates was primarily a result of the change in the mix of foreign including foreign export sales versus domestic work 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in operations of million in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operations was favorably impacted primarily by i net income of million  ii an increase in advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts of million  iii depreciation and amortization of million  and iv deferred taxes of million 
offsetting these positive influences were decreases of million in accrued liabilities  million in accounts payable  and million in accrued contract losses and reserves 
the increase in advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts resulted from accelerated or advanced billing provisions in more contracts  increased revenue and construction activity 
the increase in depreciation and amortization over fiscal levels resulted primarily from the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the stone webster acquisition 
the increase in deferred taxes over fiscal levels was substantially attributable to timing differences for certain assumed obligations associated with the stone webster acquisition 
the decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable were primarily the result of payment of liabilities assumed in the stone webster acquisition 
additionally  the company acquired a large number of contracts in the stone webster acquisition with either inherent losses or lower than market rate margins due to the effect of the financial difficulties experienced by stone webster on negotiating and executing contracts prior to the acquisition 
these contracts were adjusted to their fair value at acquisition date by establishing a gross margin reserve that reduces costs of sales for contracts as they are completed 
costs of sales was reduced by approximately million during fiscal through the utilization of this reserve  which is a non cash component of income 
costs of sales was also reduced by approximately million due to the utilization of the reserve which represents net cash losses on contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition

backlog the company defines its backlog as a working backlog that includes projects for which shaw has received a commitment from its customers 
this commitment typically takes the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order  or a specific indication of the amount of time or material the company needs to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances the engagement is for a particular product or project for which the company estimates anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
shaw s backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and shaw s customers historic maintenance requirements 
the company estimates that its backlog was approximately billion at august  the company estimates that approximately of its backlog at august  will be completed in fiscal the following table breaks out the company s backlog in the following industry sectors and geographic regions for the periods indicated 
at august  in millions in millions industry sector power generation   process industries environmental and infrastructure other industries geographic region domestic   international the company s backlog is largely a reflection of the broader economic trends being experienced by its customers and is important to shaw in anticipating its operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles and the company s backlog may not be comparable to backlog of other companies 
the company cannot provide any assurance that revenues projected in its backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
effects of inflation the company has determined it will focus its operations on cost reimbursable or negotiated lump sum contracts 
to the extent that a significant portion of the company s revenues are earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on the company s financial condition and results of operations should generally be low 
however  if the company expands its business into markets and geographical areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may begin to have a larger impact on the company s results of operations 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company intends to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts the company accepts with fixed price or lump sum terms  the company monitors closely the actual costs on the project as they compare to the budget estimates 
on these projects  the company also attempts to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of the company s industry  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials the company traditionally needs in order to perform on its contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not effect the company s results of operations in the future

an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k before deciding to invest in shares of the company s common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
demand for the company s products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the power generation and other industries to which the company markets its products and services 
the demand for shaw s products and services depends on the existence of engineering  construction and maintenance projects  particularly in the power generation industry which accounted for of the company s backlog as of august  the company also depends  to a lesser extent  on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical  environmental  infrastructure and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
the company s results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
the dollar amount of the company s backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of its future earnings 
shaw cannot provide assurance that the revenues projected in its backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
to the extent that shaw experiences significant terminations  suspensions or adjustments in the scope of its projects as reflected in its backlog contracts  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company defines its backlog as a working backlog which includes projects for which shaw has received a commitment from its customers 
this commitment may be in the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or an indication of the amount of time or material shaw needs to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which shaw estimates anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
the company s backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and customers historic maintenance requirements 
the company also includes in backlog commitments from certain individual customers who have committed to more than one significant epc project and other customers who have committed to multi year orders for piping or maintenance services 
the company cannot be assured that the customers will complete all of these projects or that the projects will be performed in the currently anticipated time frame 
on occasion  customers will cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond the company s control 
in the event of project cancellation  shaw may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically has no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in the company s backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in the company s backlog for extended periods of time 
if shaw were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in its backlog  the company s financial condition would be significantly adversely affected 
difficulties integrating acquisitions could adversely affect shaw 
the company has and may continue to acquire new businesses 
as a result  the company may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth the company expects to experience from the acquisitions 
to the extent the company encounters problems in integrating one or more acquisitions  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company plans to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
because the company may pursue acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  the company may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and operational and management oversight 
the company may not receive the economic benefits expected from entergyshaw 
on september   the company executed a definitive agreement with entergy corporation entergy governing the parties relationship with respect to entergyshaw  the equally owned and equally managed company formed by the parties on august  subsequent to the execution of the letter of intent relating to this joint venture on june   entergy and fpl group  inc  the parent of florida power light  announced a merger  but on august   these parties announced that they were abandoning their merger plans 
entergyshaw s initial focus is the construction of power plants in north america and europe for entergy s unregulated wholesale operations relating to the installation of turbines that entergy has previously ordered for these plants 
while the company believes that entergyshaw will manage the construction of most of such power plants  the company can provide no assurances regarding the number of future power plant construction projects that entergy will actually commence  or the number of turbines specifically those previously ordered by entergy that entergy will actually dedicate to any such future projects 
during fiscal  entergyshaw and the company began work on two projects for entergy which will have a total of six turbines 
the company expects to provide the engineering  procurement  construction and pipe fabrication services for substantially all of entergyshaw s power generation projects 
under the terms of the joint venture  the company must offer entergyshaw a right of first refusal on opportunities to provide fully bundled engineering  procurement and construction opportunities that it receives after december  the nature of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
shaw enters into fixed price  lump sum or unit price contracts on a significant number of domestic piping contracts and substantially all international piping projects 
in addition  a number of the contracts the company assumed in the stone webster acquisition were fixed price or lump sum contracts and the company may continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed  maximum or unit price contracts  the company agrees to perform the contract for a fixed price  and as a result  benefits from costs savings  but is unable to recover any cost overruns 
under fixed price incentive contracts  the company shares with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  the company may be required to reduce its fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns having a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of its operations could occur 
shaw s profit for these projects could decrease or the company could experience losses  if the company is unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from its suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if the company experiences cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
shaw enters into contractual agreements with customers for many of its engineering  procurement and construction services based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the company s accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in proposed reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
in addition  the company has several significant projects for agencies of the us government 
generally  us government contracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  profit and cost controls and limitations and provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience and with payment of compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination 
in the event of termination  the company generally receives some allowance for profit on the work performed 
in some cases  government contracts are subject to the uncertainties surrounding congressional appropriations or agency funding 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare the company s financial statements 
in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by the company s management  include i contract expenses and profits and application of percentage of completion accounting  ii recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  iii provisions for uncollectable receivables and customer claims  iv provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  v recoverability of net goodwill  vi recoverability of other intangibles and related amortization  and vii accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation and insurance reserves 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s results of operations depend on shaw s ability to obtain future contracts 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when shaw will receive a contract award 
in addition  timing of receipt of revenues from the company s projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients  or labor disruptions 
the uncertainty of the company s contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  shaw maintains and bears the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs under expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  the company would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on it 
projects in the industries in which the company provides products and services frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process 
because a significant portion of the company s sales are generated from large projects  the company s results of operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
shaw s significant customers vary between years 
the loss of any one or more of the company s key customers could have a material adverse impact on it 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which shaw operates could adversely affect the company 
a significant portion of the company s sales is attributable to projects in international markets 
shaw expects international sales and operations to continue to contribute materially to the company s growth and earnings for the foreseeable future 
international contracts  operations and expansion expose the company to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including o uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which shaw makes capital investments  operates and sells products and services  o the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which shaw operates and sells products and services  which could make it difficult for it to enforce the company s contractual rights  o expropriation of property  o restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  and o political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection 
foreign exchange risks may affect the company s ability to realize a profit from certain projects 
while shaw attempts to denominate its contracts in united states dollars  from time to time the company enters into contracts denominated in a foreign currency without escalation provisions 
this practice subjects the company to foreign exchange risks 
in addition  to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs  the company increases its foreign exchange risks 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions or matching the contract revenue currency with the contract costs currency 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect the company 
for instance  prior to the lifting of foreign exchange controls in venezuela in november  foreign exchange controls adversely affected the company s ability to repatriate profits from shaw s venezuelan subsidiary or otherwise convert local currency into united states dollars 
shaw generally does not obtain insurance for or hedge against foreign exchange risks for a material portion of its contracts 
in addition  the company s ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies 
failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
in certain circumstances  the company guarantees facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs and the amount of such additional costs could exceed project profit margins 
performance problems for existing and future contracts  whether fixed  maximum or unit priced  could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by the company 
a dependence on one or a few clients could adversely affect the company 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of the company s consolidated revenues in any one year  or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  the company s backlog frequently reflects multi projects for individual clients and therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a point in time 
the company has a contract with a major manufacturer of gas turbines to fabricate at least of the pipe necessary to install the combined cycle gas turbines to be built by this manufacturer domestically through  and the relationship with the turbine manufacturer has assisted the company in obtaining other work scopes  such as engineering  procurement  or construction associated with the projects for which the turbines are being manufactured 
additionally  the company has long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with whom the company has alliance agreements  that have preferred pricing arrangements  however  the company s contracts with them are on a project by project basis and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
shaw s dependence on a few suppliers and subcontractors could adversely affect the company 
the principal raw materials in the company s piping systems business are carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloy piping  which shaw obtains from a number of domestic and foreign primary steel producers 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction services shaw relies on third party equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers as well as third party sub contractors  to complete its projects 
to the extent that the company cannot engage sub contractors or acquire equipment or materials  shaw s ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
to the extent the amount the company is required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount the company has estimated in bidding for lump sum work  shaw could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  the company may be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the materials were needed 
the company s projects expose it to potential professional liability  product liability  or warranty and other claims 
shaw engineers and constructs and the company s products typically are installed in large industrial facilities in which system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by the company or where shaw s products are installed could result in significant professional liability  product liability or warranty and other claims against it 
in addition  under some of the company s contracts  shaw must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for its customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against the company for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects shaw is performing expose it to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once the company s construction is complete  shaw may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
the indemnification provisions of the company s acquisition agreements may not fully protect it and may result in unexpected liabilities 
some of the former owners of companies shaw has acquired are contractually required to indemnify the company against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before shaw acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  the company may incur unexpected liabilities 
the company s competitors may have greater resources and experience than shaw does 
in the company s engineering  procurement and construction business  shaw has numerous regional  national  and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
the company s competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major power equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of its customers 
because the company is primarily a service organization  shaw competes by providing services of the highest quality 
the markets that shaw serves require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in pipe engineering and fabrication  competition on a domestic and international level is substantial 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  the company s principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of the company s competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
a failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 
the company s ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining the company s future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to attract and retain such professionals 
in addition  shaw s ability to be successful depends in part on its ability to attract and retain skilled laborers in its pipe fabrication business 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
terrorists actions have and could negatively impact the us economy and the company s markets 
terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the united states and further acts of terrorism  violence or war could affect the markets in which the company operates  its business operations  and expectations  and other forward looking statements in this form k 
the terrorist attacks on september  have also caused instability in the world s markets 
there can be no assurance that the current armed hostilities will not increase or that these terrorist attacks  or responses from the united states  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the company s physical facilities or those of its suppliers or customers and could impact the company s domestic or international sales  its supply chain  its production capability  and its ability to deliver its products and services to its customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact the company s business 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase the company s costs and liabilities 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning o emissions into the air  o discharges into waterways  o generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and o health and safety 
the company s projects often involve nuclear  hazardous and other highly regulated materials  the improper characterization  handling or disposal of which could constitute violations of federal  state or local statutes  and result in criminal and or civil liabilities 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for certain pollutants or waste materials and require shaw to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on the company  or revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits  for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended and comparable state laws  the company may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis of allocation 
the principal federal environmental legislation affecting the company s environmental infrastructure division of its principal engineering subsidiary and its clients include the national environmental policy act of nepa  the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara 
the company s foreign operations are also subject to various requirements governing environmental protection 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which shaw is subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on the company in the future 
shaw has not conducted environmental audits of many of its properties  including the assets the company acquired from stone webster 
the company cannot give any assurance that its operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect the company 
if shaw has to write off a significant amount of intangible assets  the company s earnings will be negatively impacted 
because the company has grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of its assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if the company makes additional acquisitions  it is likely that additional intangible assets will be recorded on its books 
a determination that a significant impairment in value of the company s unamortized intangible assets has occurred would require the company to write off a substantial portion of its assets 
this write off would negatively affect the company s earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is and will continue to be involved in litigation 
the company has been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites 
such contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by the company s subsidiaries 
while the company did not assume possible liabilities relating to environmental pollution in connection with stone webster s acquisition  a federal  state or local governmental authority may seek redress from shaw or its subsidiaries and the company may be named as a potentially responsible party in an action by such governmental authority 
while the company would vigorously contest any attempt to make the company responsible for unassumed environmental liabilities  there can be no assurance that the company would not be held liable in connection with such matters in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
adverse events could negatively affect the company s liquidity position 
the company operates in an environment in which the company could be required to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without the ability to recover the expenditures as has been the experience of certain of the company s competitors 
circumstances or events which could create large cash outflows include loss contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims  cash repurchases of the lyons  etc 
although the company attempts to mitigate its risks  it cannot provide assurance that it will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all its cash needs if it encounters significant unforeseen working capital requirements which could result from these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to the company 
for example  the company could o experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or its continuing operations  o be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest associated with its debt  o have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by its creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on its properties and paying dividends  o have less success in obtaining new work if its sureties and or its lenders were to limit its ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for its projects  and o incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates 
all or any of these matters could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect the company 
some of the company s employees in the united states and abroad may be represented by labor unions 
shaw experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering its pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
from time to time shaw has also experienced attempts to unionize the company s non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  the company cannot give any assurance that it will not experience additional union activity in the future 
changes in technology could adversely affect the company and its competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
the company believes its stone webster subsidiary has a leading position in technologies for the design and construction of ethelyne plants 
the company protects it position through patent registrations  license restrictions  and a research and development program  however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes which could negatively affect the company s market position 
additionally  the company has developed construction and power generation software  which it feels provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
the company s induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence the company s ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and its proprietary software are not patented 
while the company has some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  the company s efforts to prevent others from using its technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent the company s competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to shaw s technology 
the company s success depends on key members of its management  including j 
m 
bernhard  jr 
the company s success is dependent upon the continued services of j 
m 
bernhard  jr  its founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key officers 
the loss of mr 
bernhard or other key officers could adversely affect the company 
the company does not maintain key employee insurance on any of its executive officers 
market prices of the company s equity securities could change significantly 
the market prices of the company s common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events  including the following o the other risk factors described in this form k  including changing demand for its products and services  o a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  o changes in securities analysts estimates of the financial performance of shaw or its competitors or the financial performance of companies in its industry generally  o general conditions in its industry  o general conditions in the securities markets  o issuance of a significant number of shares upon exercise of employee stock options or upon conversion of the lyons  and o issuance of shares of common stock to fund repurchases by the company of the lyons 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
provisions in the company s charter documents and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire the company and may reduce the market price of the common stock 
the company s articles of incorporation and by laws contain certain provisions  such as a provision establishing a classified board of directors in the event the entire board of directors is increased to twelve or more members  provisions entitling holders of shares of common stock that have been beneficially owned for four years or more to five votes per share  a provision prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings  a provision requiring super majority voting of the outstanding voting power to approve certain business combinations and provisions authorizing the board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without approval of the company s shareholders 
also  the company has adopted a rights plan which limits the ability of any person to acquire more than of the company s common stock 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company or the removal of management  of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to the company s shareholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for the common stock 
provisions of the company s shareholder rights agreement could also have the effect of deterring changes of control of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and short term fixed rate investments 
the company currently does not use any derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about the company s future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments and fair value at august  fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate 
average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on may   the company issued million face value  year  zero coupon unsecured convertible debt liquid yield option tm notes the lyons for which it received net proceeds of approximately million 
after paying off approximately million of outstanding debt  the remaining proceeds were invested in high quality short term cash equivalents and marketable securities held to maturity 
during fiscal  the income realized from these investments was greater than the interest costs associated with the lyons debt 
however  the company anticipates that based on its current cash flow and yield projections that interest income will be less than its interest expense in fiscal the holders of the lyons have the right to require the company to repurchase the debt on the third  fifth  tenth  and fifteenth anniversaries at the accreted value 
therefore  the debt is presented above as maturing on the third anniversary date because of the potential for repurchase requests by the debt holders at that time 
also during fiscal  the company used the proceeds from the sales of the lyons  the company s common stock see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and various assets to pay off its borrowings under its primary credit facility million at august  
at august   the interest rate on this line of credit was either if the prime rate index had been chosen or if the libor rate index had been chosen with an availability of million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this line of credit 
the estimated fair value of long term debt as of august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the convertible debt as of august  was based on recent sales of such debt as of august  the fair value of the company s other long term debt at august  and august  were based on borrowing rates currently available to the company for notes with similar terms and average maturities 
foreign currency risks the majority of the company s transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of the company s subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  the company  when considered appropriate  uses hedging instruments to manage its risks associated with its operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  the company will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or sales 
the company attempts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching its revenues and expenses in the same currency for its contracts 
as of august   the company had a minimal number of forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements
