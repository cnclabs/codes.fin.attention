item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a developer of enzyme therapies for debilitating  life threatening  chronic genetic diseases and other diseases or conditions 
since our inception on march   we have been engaged in research and development activities  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and clinical manufacturing  the establishment of laboratory and manufacturing facilities  and administrative activities 
we have incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
our losses have resulted primarily from research and development activities and related administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses at least through to date  we have not generated revenues from the sale of our drug candidates 
our lead product is aldurazyme  laronidase for injection  recombinant human alpha l iduronidase  which is undergoing clinical trials for use in enzyme replacement therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis i or mps i 
we have initiated a clinical trial of rhasb  an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mps vi or maroteaux lamy syndrome 
we have also successfully conducted preclinical studies in pigs and mice of our burn enzyme  vibriolysin  for use in debridement and grafting and expect to submit an application to the fda or foreign equivalent to begin a clinical trial by mid results of operations years ended december  and for the years ended december  and  revenues were million and million  respectively 
revenues from our joint venture with genzyme were million and million  and glyko  inc revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in joint venture revenues in was primarily the result of increased manufacturing activities as we began enzyme production in our new galli drive manufacturing facility in novato  california 
glyko  inc revenues increase in primarily as a result of increased efforts in both the united states and european sales offices 
cost of products and cost of services related to glyko  inc operations were  for compared to  for glyko s total external product and service costs as a percent of the sales of products and services were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in increased expenses in support of the aldurazyme joint venture with genzyme  especially manufacturing requirements  and of the rhasb program were the major factors in the growth of research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was partially due to the acceleration of the amortization of goodwill for the purchase of glyko  inc the estimated life of the goodwill was decreased from ten years to seven years in in the first quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million for the closure of its carson street clinical manufacturing facility 
the facility was no longer required for the production of aldurazyme  the initial purpose of the plant  after a decision by the biomarin genzyme llc joint venture to use the company s galli drive facility for the manufacture of bulk aldurazyme both for the phase iii trial and for the commercial launch of aldurazyme 
this decision was based in part on fda guidance to use an improved production process  which was installed in the galli facility  for the clinical trial  the bla submission and for the commercial production 
the majority of our technical staff at the carson street facility transferred to the galli drive facility in novato  california in may 
the charge primarily consisted of impairment reserves for leasehold improvements and equipment located in the carson street facility 
biomarin s equity in the loss of its joint venture with genzyme was million for compared to million for  as the joint venture continued the original clinical trial of aldurazyme and began a phase iii clinical trial 
interest income increased by million to million in from million in primarily due to increased cash reserves resulting from our initial public offering concurrent with an investment by genzyme in july and funds received from exercise of stock options and warrants 
the net loss was million per share  basic and diluted and million 
per share  basic and diluted for and  respectively 
years ended december  and for the years ended december  and  revenues were million and million  respectively 
included in revenues is million for services provided to the joint venture for aldurazyme compared to  for as a consequence of aldurazyme being in more complex  later stages of development and the effect of a full year of operation in compared to approximately three months of operation in revenues in also included million generated by glyko  inc compared to  for we acquired glyko  inc  our subsidiary engaged in the sale of analytical and diagnostic products and services  on october  external revenues for products and services for were up in comparison to as a result of revenues from the biochemical reagents business of oxford glycosciences plc 
lse ogs  which was acquired in may cost of products and cost of services related to glyko  inc operations were  for compared to  for glyko s external products and services costs as a percent of the sales of products and services were for and for the improvement was due to a favorable revenue mix  with a greater percentage of higher margin product sales 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for increased expenses in support of the aldurazyme joint venture with genzyme and the rhasb and the vibriolysin programs were the major factors in the growth of research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase resulted from the consolidation of glyko  inc selling and administrative expenses in expenses  an increase in staffing in our administration in compared to  and a related increase in facilities expense charged to administration in the increase in administrative staff and related expense was necessary to support expanded operations 
the equity in the loss of our joint venture with genzyme increased to million for from  for primarily as a result of increased process development and clinical manufacturing expenses 
the joint venture began in september and operated for only approximately one quarter of that year as compared to a full year of operation in interest income increased by million to million for from  for primarily due to increased cash reserves resulting from a convertible note financing in april  the initial public offering in july and august  and the private placement with genzyme in july interest expense related primarily to interest on the convertible notes accrued prior to their conversion in the initial public offering 
the net loss was million per share and million per share for and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since our inception by the issuance of common stock and convertible notes and the related interest income earned on cash balances available for short term investment 
since inception  we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we were initially funded by gbl with a million investment 
we have since raised additional capital from the sale of common stock in private placements  the sale of promissory notes convertible into common stock  an investment of million by genzyme as part of our joint venture with them  an initial public offering including the underwriters over allotment exercise  the concurrent million genzyme investment in us  the sale of million in common stock to acqua wellington and pursuant to stock option and warrant exercises 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december  and decreased million from million at december  the primary use of cash during the year ended december  was to finance operations  fund the joint venture and purchase equipment and leasehold improvements 
the primary source of cash during the year was the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options under the stock plan and pursuant to the exercise of common stock warrants 
for the year ended december   operations used million  we invested million in the joint venture which was consumed in joint venture operations  we purchased million of equipment and leasehold improvements  we raised million from the exercise of stock options and warrants and we received  from the repayment of a promissory note 
from our inception through december   we have purchased approximately million of leasehold improvements and equipment 
we expect that our investment in leasehold improvements and equipment will increase significantly during the next two years because we will provide facilities and equipment for a larger staff and increase manufacturing capacity 
as part of the acquisition of glyko  inc  we acquired in process research and development projects  the value of which was expensed as a portion of the purchase price at the time of the acquisition 
the projects acquired are each relatively small and can be grouped into two categories  analytic projects and diagnostic projects 
the analytic projects are intended to expand the analytic product line by adding new enzymes for reagent sales  new kits for agricultural applications  new instrument capabilities for protein analysis and a major upgrade of software capabilities 
at the time of the acquisition of glyko  inc  all of the analytic projects had completed feasibility work and the software projects were complete and have since been completed 
the development of specialized materials supporting instrument capabilities is deemed to be the most difficult technical hurdle for the completion and commercialization of the analytic projects 
the fair value of the analytic projects was million at the time of the acquisition 
the diagnostic projects are intended to expand a product line based on very precise measurements of the level of complex carbohydrates in blood and urine as indicators of serious disease conditions including heart disease  kidney disease and mucopolysaccharidoses or carbohydrate storage diseases 
at the time of the glyko  inc acquisition  preliminary feasibility work had been done for all of the projects and a software project was well advanced as to programming  which has since been completed 
the development of new more sensitive carbohydrate chemistry techniques is deemed to be the most difficult technical hurdle for the completion and commercialization of the diagnostic products 
the fair value of the diagnostic projects was  at the time of the acquisition 
as of december   we had expended to date approximately million on the analytic projects and million on the diagnostic projects 
if all acquired in process research and development projects proceed to completion  we expect to spend approximately  in incremental direct expense to complete the analytic projects in phases over approximately months 
we expect to spend approximately  to complete the diagnostic projects in phases within the next months 
none of these projects have been terminated to date 
since the acquisition of these in process research and development projects  there have been no subsequent developments which indicate that the completion and commercialization of either of the projects are less likely to be completed on the original planned schedule or less likely to be a commercial success 
we have made and plan to make substantial commitments to capital projects  including expanding the aldurazyme and rhasb manufacturing facilities  developing new research and development facilities  and expanding our administrative and support offices 
in september  we established a joint venture with genzyme for the worldwide development and commercialization of aldurazyme for the treatment of mps i 
we share expenses and profits from the joint venture equally with genzyme 
genzyme purchased million in common stock upon signing the agreement and million of common stock at the ipo price of per share in a private placement concurrent with the ipo 
genzyme has committed to pay us an additional million upon approval of the bla for aldurazyme 
in january  the company signed an agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund ltd 
acqua wellington for an equity investment in the company of up to million 
subject to certain conditions  including the market price of biomarin stock  these funds will be available  at the company s discretion  over the course of the next months from sales of registered common stock to be sold at a small discount to the market price 
in the initial transaction under this agreement on february   acqua wellington purchased million of the company s common stock 
the net proceeds from any sales of our common stock to acqua wellington will be used to fund operating costs  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which may include costs associated with our lead clinical programs including aldurazyme for mps i  rhasb for mps vi and our late stage preclinical program for vibriolysin  which is being studied for the debridement cleaning of severe burns 
in addition  net proceeds may also be used for the research and development of other pipeline products  building of the company s supporting infrastructure  and other general corporate purposes 
we expect our current funds to last at least through until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  we expect to continue to finance future cash needs through 
the sale of equity securities 
equipment based financing 
collaborative agreements with corporate partners we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations at least through because we expect to increase operational expenses and manufacturing investment for the joint venture and to increase research and development activities  including 
preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory review 
commercialization of our drug candidates 
development of manufacturing operations 
process development 
scale up of manufacturing facilities we anticipate a need for additional financing to fund the future operations of our business  including the commercialization of our drug candidates currently under development 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be obtained or  if obtained  will be available on reasonable terms or in a timely manner 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to 
the progress of our research and development programs 
the progress of preclinical studies and clinical trials 
the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals 
scaling up  installing and validating manufacturing capacity 
competing technological and market developments 
changes and developments in collaborative  licensing and other relationships 
the development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
the leasing and build out of additional facilities 
the purchase of additional capital equipment we plan to continue our policy of investing available funds in government securities and investment grade  interest bearing securities  primarily with maturities of one year or less 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
item a
