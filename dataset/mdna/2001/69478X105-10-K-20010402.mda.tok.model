item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary the principal business of the bank is attracting retail deposits from consumers and small businesses and investing those deposits with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in one to four residential mortgage and residential construction loans 
the company originates and purchases conforming and jumbo prime credit quality real estate secured loans through a network of approved mortgage brokers predominately located within the state of california 
the company funds substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the company s market area 
the company s ability to originate and purchase loans is influenced by the general level of product available from its broker relationships 
the company s results of operations are also affected by the company s provision for loan losses and the level of operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note  the company has suffered recurring losses and was deemed to be undercapitalized for regulatory purposes pursuant to an office of thrift supervision ots examination of the company 
as a result  the company was issued a prompt corrective action directive from the ots in march  which stipulates that the company must restore capital ratios to satisfactory levels  by june  in addition  in march the company was notified by the federal home loan bank that the company s borrowing capacity is limited to overnight advances and that new borrowings will require credit committee approval 
these factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans in regards to this matter are described in note the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the company s results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies

rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the company s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million or per share 
the net loss was primarily the result of losses from mortgage banking operations of million  a net loss on the participation contract of million  and a tax provision of million 
there was also 
million in restructuring charges related to a comprehensive restructuring in the third quarter of of all of the company s operations whereby the company ceased the purchasing and originating of loans for sale in the secondary market and refocused on retail deposit taking and originating higher balance real estate mortgage loans secured by one to four unit residential properties predominately located in california and loans for the construction of individual residences and small tracts of residences in already developed areas  known as in fill tracts for its portfolio 
the net loss in of million or per share was the result of three primary factors 
the sale of the company s residual mortgage backed securities related to three remaining securitizations resulted in a one time after tax charge of approximately million 
a lower of cost or market reserve was recorded in the amount of million against the company s held for sale loan portfolio 
additionally  the company provided an additional million for loan losses in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is due to a decrease in average balance and yield on interest earning assets 
all accretion on the participation contract was also reversed in the fourth quarter of interest income on loans receivable decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans was primarily the result of a basis points decrease in the yield on loans receivable 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase reflects a basis points increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits is primarily related to the prevailing increase in market interest rates during net interest income net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income is reflective of lower average assets combined with higher cost of funds from increased interest rates  resulting in a lower net interest margin for the period 
the bank s net interest margin for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ended december  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased to million for year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease from the previous year reflects the decrease in the loan portfolio and the losses taken on the sale of substandard and impaired loans during non interest loss non interest loss was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the loss in was primarily a result of losses from mortgage banking operations of million and write downs in the participation contract of million 
eliminating the one time charge of million related to the sale of the company s residual mortgage backed securities and related mortgage servicing rights  non interest income would have been million for the year ended december  the company sold its remaining residual mortgage backed securities retained from securitization and related servicing rights for an amount valued at million in cash and other consideration 
the transaction  which was executed on december   included the company s remaining residual mortgage backed securities and mortgage servicing for the following securitizations life financial home loan owner trust  life financial home loan owner trust  and life bank asset backed certificates  series additionally  in the company provided a reserve of million against the held for sale loan portfolio to adjust the value to the lower of cost or market 
the reserve is related to certain sub performing and impaired loans 
the reserve was established in conjunction with review of the age  composition and specific performance of the company s available for sale loans 
non interest expense noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in expense was in part due to a decrease in salaries 
there was a reduction of employees from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to a tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded december  of approximately million against the deferred tax asset as it is more likely than not that such benefit would not be realized 
the loss before income taxes decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in loss before tax benefit for the year ended december  primarily due to the loss associated with the sale of the company s residual mortgage backed securities in comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets of the company were million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in total assets of the company was primarily the result of a million decrease in the loan portfolio 
total bank deposits at december  were million compared to million at december  the decrease in deposits is the result of the reduction in the loan portfolio discussed above 
during  the bank continued its strategy to focus heavily on increasing retail deposits to reduce reliance on wholesale certificates of deposit and other borrowings 
additionally  the ratio of retail deposits to total deposits increased to for the period ended december   compared to at december  the cost of the bank s retail deposits at december  was versus at december  the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the december  allowance for loan losses as a percent of impaired loans was  the bank s net credit loss rate for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  life bank s day delinquency rate at december  was  compared to at december  comparison of operating results for the year ended december  and december  general for the year ended december  the company reported a net loss of million or per share  compared to net income of million or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income was the result of three primary factors 
the sale of the parent company s residual mortgage backed securities related to three remaining securitizations resulted in a one time after tax charge of approximately million 
a lower of cost or market reserve was recorded in the amount of million against the company s held for sale loan portfolio 
additionally  the company provided an additional million for loan losses in the fourth quarter 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is due to an increase in average balance of interest earning assets  partially offset by a lower realized yield on the company s residual mortgage backed securities 
interest income on loans receivable increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily the result of an million increase in average loans receivable 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase reflects million higher average interest bearing liabilities to support the growth in the company s assets 
the increase in retail deposits over wholesale deposits coupled with increased usage of the fhlb line of credit resulted in a decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  net interest income net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income is reflective of higher average assets combined with lower cost of funds from increased retail deposits  resulting in higher net interest margins for the period 
the bank s net interest margin for the year ending december  was compared to for the year earlier period 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase over the previous year reflects a change in the company s loan loss reserve estimate factors primarily based on actual experience of charge offs and recoveries related to the company s high loan to value second trust and sub prime first trust mortgage product 
the company exited the loan to value second trust mortgage business in the fourth quarter of at december   the company owned million of second trust mortgage products with loan to values in excess of 
non interest income loss non interest income loss was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  eliminating the one time charge of million related to the sale of the company s residual mortgage backed securities and related mortgage servicing rights  non interest income would have been million for the year ended december  the company sold its remaining residual mortgage backed securities retained from securitization and related servicing rights for an amount valued at million in cash and other consideration 
the transaction  which was executed on december   includes the company s remaining residual mortgage backed securities and mortgage servicing for the following securitizations life financial home loan owner trust  life financial home loan owner trust  and life bank asset backed certificates  series additionally  the company provided a reserve of million against the held for sale loan portfolio to adjust the value to the lower of cost or market 
the reserve is related to certain impaired loans 
the reserve was established in conjunction with review of the age  composition and specific performance of the company s available for sale loans 
non interest expense non interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expense was a combination of premises and occupancy expense associated with the expansion of branch facilities and a contractual one time severance payment made during the third quarter of income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to a benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to thousand provision for the year ended december  income before income tax provision decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the loss associated with the sale of the company s residual mortgage backed securities 
the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  management of interest rate risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines through the establishment of prudent asset concentration guidelines 
through such management  management of the company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
management of the company monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the company s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital of various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
net portfolio value 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which estimates the change in net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
a npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline the sensitivity measure 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure is  the greater its exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be 
the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by estimating the bank s npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under various market interest rate scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  an institution whose sensitivity measure in the event of a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates exceeds would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital for purpose of the risk based capital requirement 
see item business regulation federal savings institution regulation 
as of december   the bank s sensitivity measure  as measured by the ots  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million reduction in the npv of the bank 
the ots has postponed indefinitely the date the component will first be deducted from an institution s total capital 
see item business federal savings institution regulation 
the following table shows the npv and projected change in the npv of the bank at december   assuming an instantaneous and sustained change in market interest rates of   and basis points bp 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv dollars in thousands npv as of portfolio value of assets change bp net portfolio value change in rates amount change change npv ratio bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp static  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv requires the making of certain assumptions that may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the models assume that the composition of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the models assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the impact of the bank s business or strategic plans on the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  fhlb advances  other borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  and to a lesser extent  interest payments on investment securities and proceeds from the maturation of investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
however  the bank has continued to maintain the required minimum levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
this requirement  which may be varied at the direction of the ots depending upon economic conditions and deposit flows  is based upon a percentage of deposits and short term borrowings 
the required ratio is currently 
the bank s average liquidity ratios were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and short term investments 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and short term investments totaled million 
the company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises  including the utilization of fhlb advances 
at december   the bank had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb 
on march  the bank was notified by the fhlb that the bank s borrowing capacity is limited to overnight advances and each borrowing will require credit committee approval 
the advances outstanding at the time of the notice totaled  and were not effected by the change in borrowing status 
if the fhlb credit committee fails to approve requests for new borrowings  there is no assurance that the bank will be able to borrow the needed funds from other lenders or that any such loans would be on terms as favorable as those otherwise extended by the fhlb 
other sources of liquidity include investment securities maturing within one year 
the ots capital regulations require savings institutions to meet three minimum capital requirements a tangible capital ratio  a leverage core capital ratio  and an risk based capital ratio 
at december   the bank did not meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements and was therefore considered undercapitalized 
see item regulation federal savings institution regulation capital requirements 
the company had no material contractual obligations or commitments for capital expenditures at december  at december   the company had million outstanding commitments to originate or purchase mortgage loans compared to million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current and anticipated loan origination commitments 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
the company expects that a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained by the company at maturity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those derivatives at fair value 
the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of those derivatives will depend on the intended use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
on june   the fasb voted to approve a proposal to delay the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after june  calendar year for the company 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table provides information regarding the company s primary categories of assets and liabilities which are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the years ended december  and the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity date and are adjusted for expected prepayments  which are based on historical and current market information 
the loans and mortgage backed securities which have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts also is adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information
