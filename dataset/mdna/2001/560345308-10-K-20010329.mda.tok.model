item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we commenced our restaurant operations in may with the acquisition of four tgi friday s restaurants in arizona and nevada 
during the past ten years  we have grown through acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
we currently own restaurants and manage an additional six restaurants 
during  we had a change in management and implemented a long term business strategy to enhance our financial position  to place more emphasis on our casual dining business in certain designated areas  and to dispose of underperforming assets 
the first step was to strengthen our financial position 
this was accomplished by i the sale of  shares of common stock for  through a private placement transaction in january  ii the sale of five restaurants in northern california in january for  of which  in proceeds were used to repay debt see notes and to our consolidated financial statements  and iii new borrowings of  with a repayment period of years 
proceeds from the new borrowings were used primarily to pay off debt with shorter repayment periods see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also renegotiated our development agreements with carlson restaurants worldwide  inc to reduce the number of tgi friday s restaurants we were required to build with the intent to focus on those development territories that were most economically favorable see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we recorded net restructuring and reorganization gains of  in and  in related to the disposition of various non core assets and the write down of certain core assets to realizable values see note to our consolidated financial statements 
after these steps  we strengthened our operation and commenced expansion plans  principally through developing tgi friday s restaurants 
this expansion was financed by borrowings from various lenders 
the next step was taken in with the acquisition of our redfish restaurants and concept and in with the acquisition of the bamboo club restaurants and concept 
this bamboo club acquisition was financed in part by our rights offering to stockholders in in  we entered into a new loan with bank of america in the amount of  which we believe will be sufficient to fund all of the tgi friday s restaurants we plan to complete by june we executed an interest rate swap and locked in our interest rate on  of the loan total 
we believe that this is a favorable rate  as our existing financing is at a higher rate  and that this portion of the loan will be sufficient to fund our current construction and expansion of tgi friday s restaurants for the next months 
the interest rate is performance based and indexed to the libor rate plus a predetermined spread based upon our adjusted senior funded debt as defined in the loan documents to ebitda 
the interest rate is currently 
the interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
on a periodic basis  we will adjust the fair market value of the swap on the balance sheet and offset the amount of the change to other comprehensive income 
our strategy is to reduce operating costs and expand our restaurant operations 
this will entail continuing to build tgi friday s  redfish  and bamboo club restaurants and evaluating other concepts in the casual dining segment

we replaced our major supplier during the year 
much of our loss was recouped from the past supplier 
labor costs decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in this decrease was primarily due to a maturing of the restaurants we opened in once a restaurant has reached operating maturity  labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  are normalized 
additionally  during we implemented a program to increase our restaurant management staff in many of our restaurants from four to five managers 
this increase in management staff has had the effect of reducing turnover by improving the quality of life of our managers  which we believe has ultimately led to lower labor costs 
other operating expenses include rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  advertising  insurance  maintenance  and utilities 
in addition  the franchise agreements between carlson restaurants worldwide  and our company require a of net sales royalty and a of net sales marketing contribution

in total  depreciation and amortization increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the increase was due primarily to the number of new restaurants we have opened in and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue of in is the same as the percentage 
we have made a significant effort to keep this expense in line 
improved expense control  tight control on head count  and a larger revenue base over which to spread some fixed expenses helped us maintain this expense  as a percentage of sales  at last year s level 
on december   we adopted statement of position sop reporting on the costs of start up activities  as promulgated by the american institute of certified public accountants  which requires us to expense pre opening expenses as they are incurred 
prior to  we capitalized such expenses and amortized them over a period of one year

at december   we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards as well as capital loss carryforwards and tax credits available to offset future income for federal income tax purposes 
we have determined that a valuation allowance is appropriate on the deferred tax asset created by the net operating loss carryforwards as a result of our current restaurant expansion plans 
we re evaluate the need for a valuation allowance at each quarter

once a restaurant has reached operating maturity  labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  will be normalized

liquidity and capital resources our primary use of funds over the past five years has been for the acquisition of existing tgi friday s restaurants  the completion of new tgi friday s restaurants  and the acquisition of the redfish and bamboo club restaurants and concepts

we have also expended funds for the development of new restaurants 
during  we purchased the remaining minority interest in redfish america  llc for  in cash and two bamboo club restaurant operations and the bamboo club name and concept for approximately  in cash 
we financed the acquisition of the bamboo club restaurants with approximately million from available cash resources and million of short term debt from one of our lenders 
on october   we completed our stockholder rights offering by issuing  additional shares  or the maximum number available to our qualified stockholders 
the net proceeds of  were used to repay the million short term debt and the remaining million will be used to fund future new restaurant development 
net cash flows from operating activities were  in   in  and  in these were supplemented by net cash flows from financing of  in   in  and  in  which we used to fund our acquisitions and development of new restaurants 
our current liabilities exceed our current assets due in part to cash expended on our development requirements and because the restaurant business receives substantially immediate payment for sales  while payables related to inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms  usually to days

at december   we had long term debt of  and current portion of long term debt of  approximately  of this debt is a term loan comprised of five notes payable to one lender 
three of the notes bear interest at per annum and two of the notes bear interest at the one month libor rate plus basis points 
the notes are payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest that total approximately  per month 
the notes mature on may  during april  we obtained a million revolving line of credit with another lender 
the line of credit is available to finance construction and other costs associated with developing new restaurants 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at bank prime plus basis points 
the line of credit includes covenants related to our net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  profitability  and access to capital 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  the line of credit matures on july  at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
during november  we entered into two working capital revolving loan agreements with another lender 
one agreement provides for a maximum of  to finance of the costs to develop seven tgi friday s restaurants 
borrowings under this agreement will mature in years 
these borrowings are secured by the assets financed with the borrowings and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries

the terms of the bank of america loan are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the terms of the pending sale leaseback transactions are essentially the same as the sale leaseback transactions completed in we lease all of our restaurants with terms ranging from to years 
minimum payments on our existing lease obligations are approximately  per year through we believe that our current resources  our lines of credit  and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital needs during the next months at our anticipated level of new restaurant development 
we may be required to obtain additional capital to fund our planned growth after june potential sources of any such capital may include bank financing  strategic alliances  and additional offerings of our equity or debt securities 
we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available from these or other potential sources  and the lack of capital could have a material adverse effect on our business
