item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and asset quality of the company 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the financial condition of the company and the results of its operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented herein 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations compared with general net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the same period in this net income resulted in a return on average assets roa of  and a return on average equity roe of for the year ended december   compared with a roa of and a roe of  during the same period in pre tax income increased for the year ended december  to million in from million generated during the same period in the company s net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million in the company s yield on average earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company increased to during the year ended december   compared with during the same period in the company s resulting net interest margin for the year ended december  was  compared with during the same period in the compression in the net interest margin is the result of the inverted yield curve environment in which short term rates are higher than long term rates 
in turn  adjustable rate assets are repricing off of the lower  long term rates while interest bearing liabilities are pricing off of the higher short term rates 
provisions for credit losses totaled million in  compared with million in at december   the ratio of total allowance for estimated credit losses to gross loans reached  compared with at december  nonaccrual loans totaled million at december  or of total assets  compared with nonaccrual loans of million or of total assets at december  other classified loans were million at december   compared with million at december  delinquent loans totaled million at december   compared with million at december  noninterest revenues were million in  compared with noninterest revenues of million earned in noninterest revenues in included a million award from the united states treasury department s bank enterprise award program for its community involvement and the financing of affordable housing and other community projects in under secured neighborhoods  as discussed elsewhere herein 
losses from real estate operations  net  were million in  compared with income of million in the loss from real estate operations resulted primarily from a million write down and subsequent loss of million on the sale of one property versus net recoveries during total general and administrative expenses g a were million for the year ended december   a increase over the million of g a incurred during the same period in the increase in g a was primarily due to increases in employee costs and professional fees 
the million decrease in other non operating expenses was primarily due to fewer legal settlements in compared with net interest income the following table shows average balance sheet data  related revenues and costs  and effective weighted average yields and costs for each of the three years ended december the interest costs associated with the company s issuance of senior notes are included in the table

the operations of the company are substantially dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest margin is its net interest income divided by its average interest earning assets 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by several factors  including the level of  and the relationship between  the dollar amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relationship between the repricing or maturity of the company s adjustable rate and fixed rate loans and short term investment securities and its deposits and borrowings  and the magnitude of the company s noninterest earning assets  including nonaccrual loans and reo 
the company recorded net interest income before provision for credit losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflecting an increase of 
average earning assets were billion for the year ended december   compared with billion during  reflecting an increase of 
the yield on interest earning assets was in  compared with in the steady growth in loans was funded through deposit growth and borrowings from the fhlb 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company increased to during the year ended december   compared with during the same period in expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets  the company s resulting net interest margin was and in and  respectively 
the compression in the net interest margin is the result of the inverted yield curve environment in which short term rates are higher than long term rates 
in turn  adjustable rate assets are repricing off of the lower  long term rates  while interest bearing liabilities are repricing off of the higher  short term rates 
the substantial majority of the company s earning assets principally loans are adjustable rate 
the company s deposits are primarily comprised of term certificate accounts  which carry fixed interest rates and predominantly possess original terms ranging from six to twelve months 
the company s borrowings  which are principally derived from the fhlb  are for terms ranging from one to ten years though such terms are subject to certain early call provisions and carry both variable and fixed interest rates 
as of december   of the company s net loan portfolio was adjustable rate  with of such loans subject to repricing no less frequently than annually 
the substantial majority of such loans are priced at a margin over various market sensitive indices  including the one year cmt  the one month cmt  the mta  libor and the prime rate 
based upon the recent decline in the effective yield of these indices  the company expects that the yield on its loan portfolio will decline over the coming months to fully incorporate the recent decrease in market interest rates 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging twelve months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated six months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
the maturities  as reflected in the repricing table under interest rate risk management  indicate that the company will continue to see a compression in the net interest margin in the first half of the company expects that the cost of its certificate accounts will decrease in the coming months  as maturing and newly acquired accounts are priced at current  lower offering rates 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb are fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining of the borrowings carry an adjustable interest rate  with of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate  maturing in february the remaining is tied to one month libor  and matures in may accordingly  the recent decrease in market interest rates is expected to result in a gradual decrease in the cost of the company s currently outstanding fhlb borrowings  and the cost of any newly acquired borrowings will reflect current market pricing 
the following table sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest revenues and interest costs attributable to changes in the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate  changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume and changes attributable to both rate and volume

includes the interest on nonaccrual loans only to the extent that it was paid and recognized as interest income 
the company s interest revenues increased by million  or  during the year ended december   compared with the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the average balance of loans outstanding and a basis point increase in the yield on average loans outstanding  which averaged during  compared with in average total loans  net of deferred fees  grew to billion in  an increase of over billion in interest costs increased by million  or  during the ended december   compared with the same period in the average balance of certificates of deposits increased million  to million and in average cost of funds during the year ended december   compared with million and in average cost of funds during the same period in in addition  the average balance of money market accounts reflected an increase of million  to million and in average cost of funds in  compared with million and in average cost of funds in the increase in volume and rates on deposits had a negative impact on the company s average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
these changes in interest revenues and interest costs produced an increase of million  or  in the company s net interest income for the year ended december   compared with the same period during expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets  the company s net interest margin decreased to during  compared with the net interest margin of produced during the same period in the compression in the net interest margin is the result of the inverted yield curve environment in which short term rates are higher than long term rates 
in turn  adjustable rate assets are repricing off of the lower  long term rates and interest bearing liabilities are pricing off of the higher  short term rates 
provision for estimated credit losses provisions for estimated credit losses were million and million for and  respectively 
the company s ratio of net charge offs was in  an improvement over in additionally  total classified assets to bank core capital and general allowance for estimated credit losses have decreased to in  compared with in average loans outstanding during increased by million  or over  while the provision for credit losses decreased by million in  or  compared to provisions 
the company reported a ratio of the general allowance for estimated credit losses to loans receivable  net of specific reserves  of as of december   compared with as of december  although the company maintains its allowance for estimated credit losses at a level which it considers to be adequate to provide for potential losses  based on presently known conditions  there can be no assurance that such losses will not exceed the estimated amounts  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations 
the calculation of the adequacy of the allowance for estimated credit losses  and therefore the requisite amount of provision for credit losses  is based on several factors  including underlying loan collateral values  delinquency trends and historical loan loss experience  all of which can change without notice based on market and economic conditions and other factors 
see asset quality for a more complete discussion of the company s allowance for estimated credit losses 
noninterest revenues noninterest revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million earned in loan related fees primarily consist of fees collected from borrowers for the early repayment of their loans  for the extension of the maturity of loans predominantly short term construction loans  with respect to which extension options are often included in the original term of the company s loan and in connection with certain loans which contain exit or release fees payable to the company upon the maturity or repayment of the company s loan 
the company anticipates that these loan related fees will decrease as the nature of loans that we are currently underwriting will not allow us to charge the same level of fees as in prior years 
noninterest revenues for the year ended december  included a million award from the united states treasury department s bank enterprise award program for its lending and financial services activities in distressed communities 
the bank was one of depository institutions that received awards in in addition  the bank s service fees on deposits of million in increased from  primarily due to a new fee schedule rolled out in july real estate operations the table below sets forth the costs and revenues attributable to the company s reo properties for the periods indicated 
the compensatory and legal costs directly associated with the company s property management and disposal operations are included in general and administrative expenses

property operations principally include the net operating income collected rental revenues less operating expenses and certain renovation costs from foreclosed income producing properties or receipt  following foreclosure  of similar funds held by receivers during the period the original loan was in default 
during the year ended december   the company sold properties generating net cash proceeds of million and a net loss of million  compared with sales of properties generating net cash proceeds of million and a net recovery of million during the year ended december  noninterest expenses general and administrative expenses the table below details the company s general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated

the increase in employee costs was primarily due to million in higher incentive costs and a decrease of million in deferred costs related to more standardized loan structures and underwriting procedures 
the increase in professional fees was primarily comprised of outside consultants working on operational projects  partially offset by decreases in legal fees attributable to ongoing litigation matters previously disclosed as well as loan documentation and restructurings 
see item legal proceedings 
the company pays premiums to the saif based upon the dollar amount of deposits it holds and the assessment rate charged by the fdic  which is based upon the company s financial condition  its capital ratios and the rating it receives in connection with annual regulatory examinations by the ots 
the increase in g a expenses had a negative impact on the company s efficiency ratio defined as total general and administrative expenses divided by net interest income before provision and noninterest revenues  excluding reo  net 
the efficiency ratio for the year ended december   increased to compared with during the same period in other non operating expense other non operating expense totaled million for the year ended december   primarily incurred during the first quarter  of which million related to amounts paid  or reserved for payment  in connection with ongoing litigation and or satisfaction of judgments against the company 
the remaining expense was primarily in connection with the early termination of the irvine office lease 
income taxes the company recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december   compared with million during the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in compared with general net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the same period in this net income resulted in a return on average assets of  and a return on average equity of  compared with a roa of and roe of  during the same period in pre tax income increased for the year ended december  to million from million generated during the same period in the company s net interest income before provision for credit losses increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million in the company s yield on average earning assets was for the year ended december   compared with during the same period in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company decreased to during the year ended december   compared with during the same period in the company s resulting net interest margin for the year ended december   was  compared with during the same period in provisions for credit losses totaled million in  compared with million in this growth in the provision for credit losses was the result of management s previously announced commitment to increase the bank s allowance for estimated credit losses by the end of this commitment acknowledged the significant growth in net loans  the introduction during and of new loan products  and the resulting lack of seasoning of many of the bank s loans 
at december   the ratio of total allowance for estimated credit losses to gross loans reached  compared with at december  nonaccrual loans totaled million at december  or of total assets  compared with nonaccrual loans of million or of total assets at december  included in nonaccrual loans at december   were five single family residential loans with balances greater than million representing million  or of total nonaccrual loans  and one commercial loan with a million balance  or of total nonaccrual loans  at december  the average ltv for the five single family residential loans was 
other classified loans were million at december   compared with million at december  delinquent loans totaled million at december   compared with million at december  noninterest revenues were million in  compared with million earned in the increase in noninterest revenues resulted primarily from a greater amount of exit and release fees and prepayment penalties in connection with loans repaid during the period 
income from real estate operations  net  was million for the year ended december   compared with million earned in the decrease in income from real estate operations in was the result of higher net recoveries in  as discussed elsewhere herein 
total general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a increase over the million of g a incurred during the same period in the increase in g a was primarily due to increases in professional fees  occupancy expenses attributable to leasehold improvements at the corporate headquarters and employee costs 
the increase in professional fees was primarily comprised of legal fees attributable to ongoing litigation matters as well as loan documentation and restructurings 
the remaining professional fees consisted of the company s independent accountants  other professional fees related to operational projects and recruiting fees 
the increase in employee costs in was primarily due to additional personnel added to the company s various business and staff support groups 
the company incurred million in other non operating expenses during  of which million related to amounts paid  or reserved for payment  in connection with ongoing litigation and or satisfaction of judgments against the company  and for severance for the former ceo

the yield on interest earning assets was in  compared with in the company s interest revenues increased by million  or  during the year ended december   compared with the same period in average total loans  net of deferred fees  grew to billion in  an increase of  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans outstanding  which averaged during  compared with during the primary reason for the decline in the loan portfolio yield is due to lower yielding loans being added to the loan portfolio during  and  reflecting the increased competitive rate pressure in the marketplace and a change in the portfolio mix 
in addition  higher yielding loans were paying off during and  adding to the overall decline in the yield on average earning assets 
the steady growth in loans was funded through core deposit growth and borrowings from the fhlb 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the company decreased to during the year ended december   compared with during the same period in interest costs increased by million  or  during the year ended december   compared with the same period in  primarily due to a increase in the average balance of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average rates incurred on the company s deposits and fhlb advances  which together averaged for the year ended december   compared with during the same period of the average balance of certificates of deposits increased million  to million and in average cost of funds during the year ended december   compared with million and in average cost of funds during the same period in at december   certificates of deposit totaled million  or of total deposits  from million  or of total deposits at december  this reduced reliance on certificates of deposit  in conjunction with a decrease in the weighted average rate on deposits and fhlb advances  had a positive impact on the company s cost of interest bearing liabilities and was achieved by capitalizing on the bank s strong community involvement 
expressed as a percentage of interest earning assets  the company s resulting net interest margin was and in and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income was primarily due to significant growth in earning assets  which was a direct result of the bank s continuing successful pursuit of real estate secured financing business

capital resources and liquidity the company had million cash on hand at december  the company is a holding company with no significant business operations outside of the bank 
its requisite obligations  which pertain to its debt and operations  are dependent upon its sole source of funds  which are dividends from the bank 
the company s liquidity position refers to the extent to which the company s funding sources are sufficient to meet its current and long term cash requirements 
federal regulations currently require savings associations to maintain a monthly average daily balance of liquid assets equal to of the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter 
the bank has liquidity ratios of and for december and  respectively 
on march   the ots issued an interim final rule that eliminates the liquidity requirement and replaced it with a general requirement that thrifts maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safety and soundness 
the company s current primary funding resources are deposit accounts  principal payments on loans  proceeds from sales of reo  advances from the fhlb and cash flows from operations 
other possible sources of liquidity available to the company include whole loan sales  commercial bank lines of credit  and direct access  under certain conditions  to borrowings from the federal reserve system 
the cash needs of the company are principally for the payment of interest on and withdrawals of deposit accounts  the funding of loans  operating costs and expenses  and holding and refurbishment costs on reo 
in july  the company authorized the repurchase of up to an additional of its common stock  or approximately  shares 
this is in addition to the repurchase authorization announced in march  for approximately  shares 
as of february   the company has repurchased  shares at an average price of 
in november  the company repurchased  of its senior notes at an average price of of par value 
as of february   the company repurchased million of its senior notes at an average price of of par value 
on march   hfc capital trust i the trust  a statutory business trust and wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued in a private placement transaction million of capital securities the capital securities  which represent undivided preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the trust 
the company is the owner of all the beneficial interests represented by the common securities of the trust the common securities together with the capital securities the trust securities 
the trust exists for the sole purpose of issuing the trust securities and investing the proceeds thereof in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures the junior subordinated debentures issued by the company and engaging in certain other limited activities 
the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust will mature on june   at which time the company is obligated to redeem the capital securities 
the company intends to use the proceeds to repurchase some of its outstanding senior notes due in order to reduce its overall interest costs 
to the extent that the company is unable to use the full amount of the proceeds to repurchase senior notes  the capital will be used to repurchase common stock or to fund acquisitions of complementary lines of business 
some portion of the proceeds may be invested in the bank to support future growth 
pending use of the proceeds as described above  the proceeds will be invested in short term investments 
liquidity ots regulations require a savings association to maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash and cash equivalents  and certain marketable securities that are not committed equal to at least of either the average daily balance of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings during the preceding calendar quarter  or the amount of its net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowings at the end of its preceding calendar quarter 
under firrea  this liquidity requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to any amount within the range of to of such accounts and borrowings depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of the member associations 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet this liquidity ratio requirement 
the company s average liquidity for the quarter ending december   was  which exceeds the applicable requirements 
on march   the ots issued an interim final rule that eliminates the liquidity requirement and replaced it with a general requirement that thrifts maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safety and soundness 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
please refer to item business statistical financial data loan portfolio  for a thorough discussion of the company s lending activities 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon the company s net interest income nii and theoretical liquidation value  also referred to as net portfolio value npv 
npv is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
changes in the nii the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are influenced to a significant degree by the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of the company s loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices  such as cofi  prime rate  cmt  mta and libor 
the majority of the company s deposits are time deposits with a stated maturity generally one year or less and a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of the company s borrowings from the fhlb are fixed rate  with remaining terms ranging from one to ten years though such remaining terms are subject to early call provisions 
the remaining of the borrowings carry an adjustable interest rate  with of the adjustable borrowings tied to the prime rate  maturing in february changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect the company s interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the company s assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
alco seeks to stabilize the company s nii and npv by matching its rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  the nii generally will be negatively impacted by increasing rates and positively impacted by decreasing rates 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by increasing rates and negatively impacted by decreasing rates 
the speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on the company s nii and npv  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
the company utilizes two methods for measuring interest rate risk  gap analysis and interest rate simulations 
gap analysis focuses on measuring absolute dollar amounts subject to repricing within certain periods of time  particularly the one year maturity horizon 
interest rate simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the company s financial instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks 
interest rate simulations provide the company with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are subjected to tests of up to basis points in increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
under each interest rate scenario  the company projects its net interest income and the npv of its current balance sheet 
from these results  the company can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
since  the company has been utilizing interest rate floors to mitigate the risk of interest margin compression in a decreasing rate environment 
additionally  on most new income property loans  the company utilizes interest rate caps 
these are life caps and are usually three points above the rate at underwriting or at an amount that would still allow for one to one debt service coverage at the maximum rate  thereby reducing the likelihood of borrower default in a rising rate environment 
the risk to the company associated with the interest rate floors is that interest rates may decline  and the borrower may choose to refinance the loan  either with the company or with another financial institution  resulting in the company having to replace the higher yielding asset at a lower rate 
the risk to the company associated with interest rate caps is that interest rates will exceed the maximum rates on such loans  and while the company s cost of funds continues to rise  the interest income derived from these loans will be fixed  resulting in an overall compression on net interest income 
a traditional  although analytically limited measure  of a financial institution s irr is the static gap 
static gap is the difference between the amount of assets and liabilities adjusted for any off balance positions which are expected to mature or reprice within a specific period 
generally  a positive gap benefits an institution during periods of rising interest rates  and a negative gap benefits an institution during periods of declining interest rates 
however  because a portion of the indices that the company s loan products are priced to may lag changes in market interest rates by three months or more  the company s net interest income may not reflect changes in interest rates immediately 
at december   of the company s interest bearing deposits were comprised of certificate accounts  the majority of which have original terms averaging twelve months 
the remaining  weighted average term to maturity for the company s certificate accounts approximated six months at december  generally  the company s offering rates for certificate accounts move directionally with the general level of short term interest rates  though the margin may vary due to competitive pressures 
the maturities  as reflected in the repricing table under interest rate risk management  indicate that the company will continue to see a compression in the net interest margin in the first half of the company expects that the cost of its certificate accounts will decrease in the coming months  as maturing and newly acquired accounts are priced at current  lower offering rates 
however  if interest rates continue to fall  the company may be unable to match the decrease in its offered deposit rates in order to mitigate the risk of deposit outflows 
the following table sets forth information concerning repricing opportunities for the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  the amount of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual maturities  except that adjustable rate products are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
such assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of their maturity or repricing date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company realizes income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  and other interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while structuring the company s asset liability mix to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact the company s income to the extent that the interest rates borne by the assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor its interest rate risk exposure 
as a part of this effort  the company uses the npv methodology to gauge interest rate risk exposure 
using an internally generated model  the company monitors interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cashflows on interest earning assets and other assets  and the outgoing cashflows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the npv ratio is defined as the npv for a given rate scenario divided by the market value of the assets in the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the decline in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  whichever produces the largest decline 
the higher an institution s sensitivity measure  the greater is considered its exposure to irr 
the ots also produces a similar analysis using its own model  based upon data submitted on the bank s quarterly thrift financial report tfr 
at december   based on the company s internally generated model  it was estimated that the company s npv ratio was in the event of a basis point increase in rates  a decrease of from basecase of 
if rates were to decrease by basis points  the company s npv ratio was estimated at  an increase of from basecase 
presented below  as of december   is an analysis of the company s irr as measured in the npv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of   and basis point increments in market interest rates 
net portfolio value change change from change from in rates amount basecase ratio basecase dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp management believes that the npv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected cash flows  weighing each by its appropriate discount factor 
second  because the npv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an association s irr exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
on a quarterly basis  the results of the internally generated model are reconciled to the results of the ots model 
historically the ots has valued the npv higher  but the changes in npv as a result of the rate increases and decreases are normally directionally consistent between the two models 
the difference between the two models resides in the prepayment assumptions  the ability of the company to analyze each individual rate index in a changing environment  and the ability of the company s model to include caps and floors on loans in the rate shock analyses 
through the inclusion of more specific information regarding the company s unique loan portfolio  the internal model reflects greater sensitivity in both an increasing and a declining rate environment
