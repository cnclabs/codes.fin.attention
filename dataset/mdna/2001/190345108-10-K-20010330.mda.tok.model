item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products we believe that the company is the largest wholesale distributor of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for recreational vehicles rvs  and one of the largest distributors of replacement parts  accessories and supplies for boats  in north america 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
our sales are affected primarily by i usage of rvs and boats which affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers and their confidence about economic conditions 
weather conditions also affect the usage of rvs and boats 
additionally  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline also can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by recessionary economic conditions  increases in interest rates  which affect the availability and affordability of financing for purchases of rvs and boats  increases in the prices of gasoline  and unusually adverse weather conditions 
we believe that increases in interest rates and gasoline prices which began in the second quarter of  and growing uncertainties among consumers about economic conditions beginning in the latter part of the year  contributed to our poor financial performance in results of operations net sales 
net sales in declined by  or as compared to we believe that this decline  which began late in the second quarter of  was primarily attributable to increases in gasoline prices and interest rates which  coupled with growing uncertainties among consumers about the economy during the latter part of the year  resulted in a decrease in both the usage and purchase of recreational vehicles and  in turn  led to a decline in purchases of our products by our customers in response to those conditions 
net sales in increased by approximately  or as compared to  due primarily to an increase  during the first half of  in consumer demand for the products we sell  which we believe resulted primarily from increases in sales and usage of recreational vehicles and boats 
operating results in also included a full year of sales from marine distributors  a marine products distribution business that we acquired late in may  the sales of which were therefore not included in our operating results for the first five months of gross margin 
our gross margin declined to of net sales in from in this decline was due primarily to increased price competition in the second half of the year in response to slowing sales in our markets  the adverse effect of lower sales volume on fixed costs and a change in the mix of our sales to a higher proportion of higher priced  but lower margin accessories 
by contrast  in our gross margins increased to of net sales from in  due primarily to i selected price increases on the products that we sell  and ii the impact of fixed costs on a higher sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for from in and in these increases were primarily attributable to higher selling and marketing costs  as we expanded our marine products marketing and sales efforts during and  and due to expenses that we incurred in connection with the installation and testing of a new computer system in and the costs of integrating that system into our operations and of improving the functionality of that system in nearly all of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income 
the decline in operating income in was due primarily to the combined effects of the decreases in sales and gross margin and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses more than offset the improvements in our net sales and gross margin achieved during the year  and therefore  operating income declined to  in as compared to  in interest expense 
during  interest expense increased by  or  as compared to this increase was i primarily the result of increases in average long term borrowings outstanding during the first nine months of  which were used to fund operations and to fund repurchases of shares of our common stock in the latter half of  and ii to a lesser extent  due to increases in interest rates during interest expense in decreased by  or as compared to this decrease was largely the result of a reduction in the rate of interest that we paid on our revolving line of credit 
we will continue to rely on borrowings to fund a substantial portion of our working capital requirements and future growth  and  as a result  we anticipate that interest will continue to be a significant expense for us 
other income 
other income in was the result of a one time sale of one of our proprietary product lines to a recreational vehicle supplies manufacturer  which has agreed to supply that product  along with products from its other product lines to us in future periods 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving credit facility from a bank and internally generated funds 
we also have  of outstanding borrowings under a term loan that we obtained from the same bank  a substantial portion of the proceeds of which were used to fund repurchases of our shares in the latter part of under the terms of the revolving credit facility  which expires in may  we may borrow up to the lesser of i  with a seasonal increase to  between march and june of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory the borrowing base 
interest on the revolving credit facility is payable at the bank s prime rate plus basis points or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  borrowings will bear interest at the bank s libor rate  plus basis points 
interest on the term loan is payable at the bank s prime rate plus basis points or at the bank s libor rate  plus basis points 
at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan totaled  borrowings under the credit facility and term loan are secured by substantially all of the company s assets and rank senior in priority to other indebtedness of the company 
we believe that available credit under our revolving credit facility and term loan  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements and other cash requirements over the next twelve months 
we do not presently anticipate any material increases in our cash requirements or material changes in our sources of funds in the foreseeable future 
we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases for the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in  as compared to  in and  in accounts receivable collections slowed during  as compared to  due largely to sales declines experienced by our customers primarily are a result of a slowing in consumer usage and purchases of recreational vehicles and boats in apparent response to increases in gasoline prices and interest rates and economic uncertainties in the second half of during the second half of  we began the implementation of a new inventory management strategy which contributed to a reduction of  in inventory during as compared to an increase of  for the strategy also enabled us to accelerate our payments to our vendors  which has resulted in a reduction in our accounts payable in of  as compared to an increase in accounts payable of  in capital expenditures were  in as compared to  in and  in the increases in capital expenditures in and were related to the acquisition and installation of the company s new computer system and improvements made in its functionality during during we received proceeds of  from the sale of an investment 
in may  we used cash of  to acquire the inventory of marine distributors  inc  a distributor of marine products 
borrowings under our credit facility decreased by  in  as compared to an increase of  in and a decrease of  in in june  we made the final payment  in the amount of  on our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
in early  we began an open market and private stock repurchase program and  during  we purchased  of shares of our common stock 
we do not currently expect to make any purchases of shares during we lease the majority of our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  our future lease commitments are described in note e of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
sales of recreational vehicle and boating parts  supplies and accessories are seasonal 
we have significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august than we do during the remainder of the year 
because a substantial portion of the company s expenses are fixed  operating income declines and the company sometimes incurs losses and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements in months when sales are lower 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods 
quarter ended unaudited march  june  september  december  revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss  net earnings loss per share diluted quarter ended unaudited march  june  september  december  revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss   net earnings loss per share diluted inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increase in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 
we believe that the decrease in our net sales in the second half of was due in part to increases in interest rates and gasoline prices 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
to a lesser degree  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with the our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximate the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding million under our revolving credit facility 
we sometimes enter into forward exchange agreements to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of our inventory purchases in canada for our canadian operations 
the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in earnings in the period during which the transactions being hedged are recognized 
we believe that these agreements do not subject us to significant market risk from exchange rate movements because the agreements offset gains and losses on the balances and transactions being hedged 
as of december   there were no such agreements outstanding 
approximately of our debt is denominated in canadian currency  which also exposes us to market risk associated with exchange rate movements 
historically  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations since the market risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt has not been considered significant 
this report contains forward looking information which reflects management s current views of future financial performance 
the forward looking information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the effect on future performance of changing product supply relationships in the industry and the uncertainties created by those changes  the potential for increased price competition  possible changes in economic conditions  prevailing interest rates or gasoline prices  or the occurrence of unusually severe weather conditions  that can affect both the purchase and usage of rvs and boats and which  in turn  affects purchases by consumers of the products that the company sells 
for information concerning such factors and risks  see the foregoing discussion in this section of this report titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
due to such uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
certain factors that could affect our future financial performance statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations or beliefs regarding our future operations or future financial performance constitute forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are estimates of future performance that are based upon current information and that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results or financial performance in future periods to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following our business is subject to various economic and climatic influences 
our sales are affected directly by the purchase and usage levels of rvs and boats 
the purchase and  in particular  the usage of rvs and boats  are affected by weather conditions 
as a result  our sales and operating results ordinarily decline in the winter months and we sometimes incur losses in these periods of the year 
purchases and usage of rvs and boats also are affected by consumers level of discretionary income and their confidence about economic conditions and changes in interest rates and in the availability and cost of gasoline 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  adversely affected by the following loss of confidence among consumers regarding economic conditions and the onset of economic recessions  which affect the willingness of consumers to purchase and use their rvs and boats  increases in interest rates which affect the availability and affordability of financing for rvs and boats  increases in the costs and shortages in the supply of gasoline which affect the costs of using and the ability to use rvs and boats  and unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions  which can reduce the usage of rv and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions 
these conditions also often lead to increased price competition in our markets which could force us to reduce our prices  thereby reducing sales revenue and our margins 
all of these conditions contributed to the decline in our sales and the losses we incurred in the year ended december  and are likely to impact our operating results in the year ending december  we rely on bank borrowings to finance our business 
we rely heavily on bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our outstanding borrowings could harm us in the future 
we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund expansion or take advantage of other business opportunities  and we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt 
therefore  our existing debt makes us more vulnerable to general economic downturns and competitive pressures and  as discussed in the section of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the interest we have to pay on such debt impacts our operating results 
the effects of possible changes in supply relationships in our markets 
as is the customary practice in our markets  in most instances we do not have long term supply contracts with our product suppliers 
as a result  product suppliers are free to change the terms on which they will sell us products or to discontinue supplying us with products altogether  because they may choose to distribute their products directly to after market dealers or because they might choose to establish exclusive supply relationships with other distributors 
additionally  manufacturers of new rvs and boats may choose to incorporate optional equipment on their rvs and boats at the time of manufacture that  historically  were provided to their dealers by distributors such as the company 
any of these occurrences could result in increased competition in our markets or reduce the number of products we are able to offer our customers  which could cause our sales to decline and could result in lower margins 
electricity supply shortages 
california is currently experiencing a tightening in the supply of electricity to the state and there have already been a few rolling power outages or blackouts in the past few months and more are expected during the summer months when electricity usage is typically at its peak 
power outages could disrupt our operations  increase our operating costs and reduce the productivity of our operations 
power outages also could interfere with the ability of customers to reach our national sales and customer service center which is located in northern california and could result in the shut down of our computer systems that could cause financial and operating data to be lost and slow down our ability to fill customer orders 
we have developed contingency plans to deal with such power outages that include the use of alternative energy generating equipment to provide power to essential systems and we have back up computer systems at certain of our distribution centers located outside of california that can be used during power outages 
however  we do not know and cannot predict the frequency or duration of the power outages that may occur and  therefore  despite our contingency plans  such outages could adversely affect our future operating results 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking information contained in this report
