vs 
in millions cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities  cash used in provided by financing activities operations generated million in compared to million in and million in the changes in cash flow from operating activities were primarily the result of factors discussed above in the analysis of operating results 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses 
our investing activities provided net cash of million in and million in we used net cash of million in our investing activities in the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in is due to proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and reduced property acquisition and development activity 
the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in is due to higher net proceeds from sales of properties and substantially lower levels of property acquisitions

net debt repayments during totaled million versus million in we also repurchased million of our common stock in our financing activities used net cash of million in and provided net cash of million in in  we sold stock  generating proceeds of million  borrowed a net of million on our unsecured credit facilities  primarily to finance acquisitions and issued million of senior unsecured notes 
in  we repurchased million of our common stock  borrowed a net of million on our unsecured credit facilities and did not issue any unsecured notes 
liquidity and capital resources we seek to create and maintain a capital structure that will enable us to diversify our capital resources 
this should allow us to obtain additional capital from a number of different sources 
these sources could include additional equity offerings of common stock and or preferred stock  public and private debt financings and possible asset dispositions 
our management believes that we will have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business  to fund our operating and administrative expenses  to continue to meet our debt service obligations  to pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements  to acquire additional properties and land and to pay for construction in progress 
we have three investment grade ratings 
as of december   duff phelps credit rating co 
and standard poors have assigned a bbb rating to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and their bbb rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
moody s investor service has assigned its baa rating to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and its ba rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
our total debt at december  was billion 
million of the total debt bore a libor based floating rate 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings on our unsecured credit facility for was 
the interest rate of the unsecured credit facility is basis points over day libor 
our fixed rate mortgage payable debt bore an effective weighted average interest rate of at december  the weighted average term of this debt is seven years 
at december   our debt represented of our total market capitalization of billion 
we have a million unsecured credit facility 
as of december   million was drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit were outstanding and we had million available for borrowing 
this credit facility matures in august and we are in the process of negotiating the terms of renewal 
based on the progress of the negotiations  we expect that we will continue to have credit available to meet our needs on satisfactory terms 
rental revenue and real estate service revenue have been our principal sources of funds to pay our operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures  excluding non recurring capital expenditures 
we believe that our current sources of revenue will continue to provide the necessary funds for our operating expenses and debt service 
we and our affiliates also require capital to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets for capital projects 
these capital projects can be such things as large scale renovations  routine capital expenditures  deferred maintenance on properties we have recently acquired and tenant related matters  including tenant improvements  allowances and leasing commissions 
we will require a substantial amount of capital for development projects currently underway and in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million square feet of office space in six development projects in progress 
our total expected investment on these projects is million 
through december  we had invested million or of the total expected investment for these projects 
as of december   we also had million square feet of office space under construction in seven projects in which we own minority interests 
these projects are expected to cost million of which  our total investment is expected to be approximately million 
through december   approximately million or of the total project costs had been expended 
we have financed our investment in projects under construction at december   primarily from the proceeds of asset dispositions and borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect that these sources and project specific financing of selected assets will provide additional funds required to complete the development and to finance the costs of additional projects 
prior to the second quarter of  we primarily met our capital requirements by accessing the public debt and equity markets 
as a general matter  conditions in the public equity markets for most reits have not been favorable since that time 
in response to these unfavorable conditions  we have curtailed our acquisition program and satisfied our capital requirements through the disposition of selected assets  the refinancing of selected assets  prudent use of joint ventures to reduce our investment requirements and use of our credit facility 
in the future  if the debt and equity markets are not favorable  if we cannot raise the expected funds from the sale of properties and or if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we believe that we would continue to have sufficient funds to pay our operating and debt service expenses and our regular quarterly dividends and to make necessary routine capital improvements with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
however  our ability to continue to fund all of our current development projects could be adversely affected 
if we determine that it is in our best interest to continue to fund all of our current development projects  we may have to access either the public equity or debt markets at a time when those markets may not be the best source of capital for us 
as of december   our portfolio of rental properties in phoenix exclusive of one property and three parcels of land were under contracts for sale for purchase prices of million and million  respectively 
the sale of the phoenix portfolio closed on february   producing net proceeds of million that will be used to fund development projects and meet other corporate needs 
we recognized a gain of million  net of tax of million 
we also repaid a million mortgage on one of the properties sold 
our board of directors has authorized us to spend up to million to repurchase our common shares 
during  we acquired approximately million shares for million  an average price of per share 
we pay dividends quarterly 
funds  which we accumulate for the distribution  are invested primarily in short term investments collateralized by securities of the united states government or one of its agencies 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit 
based on our experience  funds from operations  along with information about cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as follows net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  less gains or plus losses from sales of depreciable operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
our funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than us 
we continue to exclude the gain loss on settlement of treasury locks for funds from operations 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flow generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
as such  it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions 
the following table provides the calculation of our funds from operations for the years presented in thousands income from continuing operations before minority interest    adjustments to derive funds from operations add depreciation and amortization    gain loss on settlement of treasury locks   deduct minority interests non unitholders share of depreciation  amortization and net income  gain on sale of assets and other provisions  net    funds from operations before allocation to the minority unitholders    less funds from operations allocable to the minority unitholders    funds from operations allocable to carramerica realty corporation    less preferred stock dividends    funds from operations attributable to common shareholders    changes in funds from operations are largely attributable to the effects of property acquisitions and dispositions and new developments as discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk increases in interest rates  or the loss of benefits from any hedging agreements would increase our interest expense 
these events would adversely affect cash flow 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit that bears a floating interest rate 
in addition  we had million of fixed rate mortgage debt 
our unsecured credit facilities mature in august the mortgage loans mature at various dates through we also have million senior unsecured notes  which mature between and our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates 
market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative and commodity instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
we manage our risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities with projected cash outflows to fund debt payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  distributions and other cash requirements 
we may also use derivative financial instruments at times to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements may be used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
we use derivative financial instruments only for hedging purposes  and not for speculation or trading purposes 
if the market rates of interest on our variable rate debt change by or approximately basis points  our interest expense would change by approximately million 
this assumes the amount outstanding under our variable rate credit facility remains at million  our balance at december  the book value of our variable interest credit facility approximates market value at december  a change in interest rates generally does not impact future earnings and cash flows for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  and additional debt is incurred to fund the repayments of maturing facilities  future earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in interest rates 
this impact would be realized in the periods subsequent to debt maturities 
the following is a summary of the fixed rate mortgages and senior unsecured debt maturities at december  in thousands thereafter  if we assume the repayments of fixed rate borrowings are made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective credit arrangements  a percent change in the market interest rate for the respective fixed rate debt instruments would change the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the estimated fair market value of the fixed rate debt instruments and the senior unsecured notes at december  was million and million  respectively
