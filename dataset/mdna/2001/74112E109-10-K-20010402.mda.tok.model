item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has four operating segments diagnostics  biotech  laboratory instrumentation and other 
two of these  diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation primarily manufacture products 
within diagnostics there are three groups quality control panels  accurun r run controls  and diagnostic components 
the remaining two segments generate primarily service revenue and consist of bbi biotech  and other development stage research and development 
within bbi biotech there are three groups contract research  blood processing and repository services  and research services 
revenue in the other segment consists of both private and nih funded support for the research activities associated with our pressure cycling technology and drug discovery operations 
see note of notes to financial statements for a further discussion of the activities of these segments and note of notes to financial statements relative to the company s discontinued clinical laboratory operations 
effective january  all of the company s technology related to its drug discovery and vaccine programs  consisting primarily of patents and related sponsored research agreements  were transferred to panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary that the company formed in october in november  panacos sold a majority of its equity to third party investors  reducing the company s ownership to which is held in non voting preferred securities 
as a result  the company no longer consolidates the results of panacos 
as of november  the company s investment in panacos was zero and the company is no longer required to fund panacos s operations 
therefore no further losses of panacos will be recorded by the company 
the company believes that this will position panacos to progress to more advanced stages of drug development including clinical trials  while at the same time allowing management to focus more time on the company s core business 
in december  the company decided to exit the clinical laboratory segment of the business and accordingly  in february  the company sold a majority of the assets and the accounts payable of bbi clinical laboratories  a wholly owned subsidiary  to a third party 
in connection with the sale  bbi clinical laboratories will continue to provide clinical laboratory testing services for at least days from the closing date of the transaction  but in no event later than december  results of operations for this segment of the business are discussed hereunder in the caption entitled discontinued operations 
prior period data has been reclassified to conform to the current format of presentation relative to continuing operations 
products the economics and cost structures of the segments have certain differences 
the diagnostics segment has historically been the largest and most profitable segment  both in absolute dollars and in operating profit margin  as it operates primarily in a commercial environment with fewer competitors and relatively short product development cycles 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had been in decline for several years prior to its acquisition in mid  and management is working to turn around this business 
it also operates in a highly competitive  low margin business contract manufacturing of instruments and medical devices 
at the current low annual revenue level of less than million  it operates significantly under capacity with high overhead  and should significantly benefit from relatively small revenue increases 
services bbi biotech has been project oriented with a high proportion of its revenue generated from government contracts for both research and service activities and assisting the other segments in their new product and service development 
it has the highest level of inter segment activity  and is structured around project tracking of direct costs plus overhead and a low percentage fee 
its financial goal has been to breakeven while contributing to the development of future products and services for the company 
the other segment s r d operation does not currently have any product or service revenue  and no significant revenues are expected in the near future 
revenue to date consists of both private and public nih funding of segment research 
most of the expenditures by this segment are for r d expenses  and general management expenses including patent costs 
the company continues to seek funding from both private and public sources to minimize the impact of their development costs on the company s overall operating results 
in this regard  panacos pharmaceuticals obtained independent third party equity financing in november  thus terminating the company s responsibility going forward to fund future research and development activities of panacos 
the company retains a interest in non voting preferred shares of panacos 
quarterly fluctuations historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures 
in particular  in the diagnostics segment  the company s sales of its off the shelf quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas oem product sales may peak in any quarter of the year  depending on the production cycle of a given project 
in the company s bbi biotech segment  research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result these contracts can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
neither the laboratory instrumentation segment nor the other segment are subject to material seasonal variations 
research and development with the acquisition of bioseq  inc and its pressure cycling technology in september as well as the hiring of a vice president for the drug discovery and development program which evolved into panacos pharmaceuticals  inc in the company has expended significant amounts for ongoing research and development spending on new technologies in the other operating segment 
export sales the company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenue products services total revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development acquired research and development selling and marketing general and administrative impairment of intangible asset total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for benefit from income taxes cumulative effect of change in accouting principle 
loss income from discontinued operations net loss product gross profit services gross profit years ended december  and revenue total revenue from continuing operations decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease in revenue was the result of a decrease in product revenue of or  to  in from  in  partially offset by an increase in service revenue of or  to  in from  in product revenue the product revenue decrease was primarily attributable to a  decrease in the diagnostics segment and a  decrease in the laboratory instrumentation segment 
the diagnostics decrease was the result of a reduced level of sales of its oem and seroconversion panels  and basematrix as the consolidation within the in vitro diagnostic industry has negatively affected demand for these products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accurun r and characterized disease state blood product sales 
the laboratory instrumentation segment revenue decreased due to a lower level of contract manufacturing due to the timing of an order from a large customer and another customer experiencing financial difficulty causing them to place their order on hold 
the company believes the negative effects of industry consolidation are mostly befind it and that there are growth oppertunities within both its existing business as well as providing products for rapid test and chip based technologies 
service revenue the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to increases of  from the diagnostics segment   from the biotech segment and  in the other segment 
the growth in diagnostics was related to increased service work for in vitro diagnostic manufacturers including plasma inactivations 
the biotech segment s growth was due to new government contracts for both its repository and research services 
the other segment s growth was a result of funding received from both the nih and the consortium for plasma science  which partially defrayed the cost of pressure cycling technology development and certain other drug discovery activities associated with panacos pharmaceuticals panacos 
gross profit overall gross profit decreased  or  to  in the year ended december  from  for product gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  for and product gross margin decreased to in  from in services gross profit increased  to  in from  for and service gross margin increased to in  from in product gross margin the decrease in product gross margin was due substantially to a decrease in the gross margin of the laboratory instrumentation operating segment 
this decrease was due to a lower level of sales activity  resulting in underutilized capacity and excess overhead costs 
in addition  the company increased the inventory reserves for both this segment and the diagnostic segment in year service gross margin the increase in service gross margins was due to small increases in both the diagnostics and other segments  which were partially offset by a lower service gross margin from the biotech segment due to an increase in low margin government contracts 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased  or  to  in as compared to  in the company continued to emphasize development efforts within the other business segment which includes bbi bioseq bioseq and panacos  the latter being included during the period january  to november  as discussed further hereunder 
other segment research and development expenditures were approximately flat 
however there was a decrease in spending at the laboratory instrumentation segment as the platemate program was discontinued in september in addition  there was a decrease in spending at biotech in order to meet contract schedules 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to  in from  in this decrease was a result of a slight reduction in promotion and travel costs  and vacancies in several key positions at the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments 
some of these positions were filled early in the third quarter of general and administrative general and administrative costs increased  or  to  for from  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in professional consulting services associated with the company s exploration of various financing and strategic transactions and options in additionally   of general and administrative personnel related expenses incurred in were capitalized as part of the erp system implementation in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company completed the project in november  therefore  no additional costs were capitalized in impairment of intangible asset as part of an ongoing strategic review process  the company s board of directors met in september to review the progress of its laboratory instrumentation segment  and that segment s prospects for the future to determine if any impairment of the segment s goodwill had occurred 
based on information presented at that meeting and subsequent analyses showing lower revenue expectations  management approved a cost reduction plan including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
using the lower revenue projections associated with this plan  the laboratory instrumentation segment s undiscounted future cash flows were projected to be less than the carrying value of that segment s goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of both accounting principles board opinion no 
intangible assets and statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  this segment s goodwill was written down by approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal year operating loss consolidated loss from continuing operations increased to  in versus a  loss in the diagnostics segment s operating income decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreased revenue and the beneficial effect on s operating income of capitalizing certain employee salaries associated with the erp system implementation 
the biotech segment s operating loss decreased to  in from  in  due to increased revenue from government contracts 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for versus a loss for of  the year loss includes a write down of approximately of their goodwill as of the previous balance sheet date 
excluding this  the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for as a result of continued low levels of revenue 
at the end of the third quarter of  management approved a cost reduction plan in the laboratory instrumentation segment including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
the operating loss of the other segment increased to  in from  in due to planned research and development and patent related costs 
the company continued to invest heavily in the areas of pressure cycling technology and the drug discovery program  through its subsidiary bbi bioseq and its investment in panacos pharmaceuticals 
the company s ownership of panacos was reduced to in the fourth quarter of as a result of panacos obtaining additional equity financing from new investors 
accordingly  the company terminated consolidation accounting subsequent to november  the company had recorded panacos s operating losses for the period january  to november  in the amount of approximately  interest expense cumulative change in accounting principle interest expense increased from  in to  in throughout the year  the company carried a higher average debt balance and interest rate on its line of credit than in additional interest expense was incurred in associated with the company obtaining a new  mortgage on its west bridgewater ma facility  effective april in addition  the company incurred a charge of  including  for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to amortization of the beneficial conversion feature  warrant costs and original issue discount debt issuance costs associated with the company s august issuance of  senior subordinated convertible debentures 
income taxes in the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and in consideration of three consecutive years of losses 
in the company recorded an income tax benefit at a combined rate of 
loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   as a result of the items discussed above 
discontinued operations the clinical laboratory services segment  a discontinued operation  had an operating loss of  in versus income of  for due to both a lower volume of molecular testing as several customers began performing these tests in house in  and competitive pricing pressure in molecular testing  resulting in lower gross margin 
summary the company had a net loss of  in as compared to a net loss of  in as a result of the operating loss  interest expense associated with the august issuance of  of debentures  the impairment of an intangible asset at the laboratory instrument segment  and the establishment of a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as described above 
years ended december  and revenue total revenue from continuing operations increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in revenue was the result of an increase in product revenue of or  to  from  partially offset by a decline in service revenue of or  to  from  in product revenue the product revenue increase was primarily attributable to a  increase by the diagnostics segment and a  increase by the laboratory instrumentation segment 
the diagnostics increase was a result of a increase in accurun r sales as the company continued to successfully penetrate the emerging end user market  and a increase in basematrix sales due to increased outsourcing occurring in the in vitro diagnostics industry 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in seroconversion panel sales  as the consolidation within the in vitro diagnostic industry has negatively affected demand for these products 
the laboratory instrumentation segment achieved a  or increase in instrument sales as it refocused its efforts in oem contract manufacturing 
management feels that the end user market will continue to be an area of growth for its quality control products while the outsourcing within the in vitro diagnostics market will continue to benefit sales of diagnostic components and laboratory instrumentation 
service revenue the decrease in service revenue was primarily attributable to a  decrease in laboratory instrumentation services as the company completed its work on the abx  inc contract in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in bbi biotech  and a  increase in the other segment revenue 
bbi biotech s growth was driven by a increase in repository services and the start of new contracts in the aids vaccine support arena 
the other segment s growth was a result of funding received from both the nih and the consortium for plasma science  which partially defrayed the cost of pressure cycling technology development 
the company anticipates that new contracts at the bbi biotech segment will contribute to revenue growth 
gross profit overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  in and product gross margin increased to in  from in services gross profit decreased  to  in from  in and service gross margin declined to in from in product gross margin the increase in product gross margin was due entirely to the gross margins realized in the laboratory instrumentation operating segment  which increased from in to in as the business unit operated at a higher volume  thus realizing better economies of scale compared with as overhead costs were spread over a greater number of units 
product gross margins at the diagnostics segment remained relatively steady 
management anticipates that further utilization increases for the laboratory instrumentation segment will continue to benefit gross margins 
service gross margin the decrease in service gross margins was realized at all operating segments 
the bbi biotech segment s service gross margin decreased from to 
bbi biotech margins were adversely affected by startup costs associated with new repository contracts in  primarily the acquisition of freezers  which under the terms of the contract become government property and thus are charged directly to cost of services 
finally  in early the laboratory instruments segment realized a decrease in service gross margins from to  as it completed the high margin abx  inc contract in early the other remaining company segments do not generate service revenues that would significantly impact segment results 
research and development research and development costs  exclusive of acquired in process research and development  increased or  to  in from  in a significant portion of the increase is attributable to the operating segment referred to as other  which consists of the pressure cycling technology pct and drug discovery activities 
the company increased its pct expenditures by approximately  as it completed the design  development  and manufacture of prototype pct instruments known as barocyclers 
the company also made significant progress during with its patents in the nucleic acid extraction and pathogen inactivation areas 
the company s increased expenditures in drug discovery by approximately  resulted in expanded rights under its agreement with the university of north carolina  at chapel hill  and significant progress in the prosecution of patents for the compounds 
in addition  the bbi biotech segment increased its spending to continue its support of the diagnostics and clinical laboratory services segments 
there were two accounting charges in  which were classified on the income statement as acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter there was an accounting charge of  related to the acquisition of the worldwide exclusive rights to bioseq  inc s immunodiagnostic research and development technology 
in the third quarter  the company recorded a charge of  related to in process technology as a result of the company s acquisition of bioseq  inc this allocation of the purchase price was based on an independent valuation and was expensed  as no alternative future uses exist 
there were no such charges during selling and marketing selling and marketing expenditures remained relatively flat during as compared to  across all operating segments 
costs declined or  to  in from  in as the company effectively managed costs in this area 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased or  to  in from  in this increase is attributable to the corporate reorganization that was announced in july of the reorganization created operating segments  which are directed by a senior vice president and general manager 
the reorganization resulted in the classification of the salaries  and other related costs  of two executives in the general and administrative line of the income statement from other income statement lines  to more accurately reflect their new responsibilities 
general and administrative costs are expected to increase in  as the reorganization impact will be felt for the entire fiscal year in addition  benefited as certain general and administrative personnel costs amounting to  were capitalized as property and equipment in connection with the implementation of enterprise resource planning systems at the diagnostics and laboratory instruments segments 
general and administrative costs at the other segments were flat 
operating loss as a result of all of the above  the company experienced an operating loss from continuing operations of  in versus  in excluding the  of acquired in process research and development charges realized in  the company s operating loss increased  to  in from  in the diagnostics operating segment realized an increase in operating income excluding  of acquired research and development costs in of approximately  or  as a result of a increase in product sales coupled with a relatively steady product gross margin 
the laboratory instrumentation segment only realized a slight reduction   in its operating loss as the improved product gross margin was more than offset by lower service profitability due to the completion of the previously discussed abx contract 
these operational improvements were more than offset by the planned increases in research and development expenditures  which resulted in significant operating losses in the other operating segment 
in addition  increased research and development expenses at the bbi biotech segment were primarily responsible for the increased operating loss of  in versus a loss of  in management anticipates continued strength from its diagnostics segment 
although the laboratory instrumentation segment has realized operating losses since it was acquired in july  the company believes that the goodwill created in connection with the acquisition is realizable as management believes that the segment will begin to generate operating income by the end of the company will continue to increase its spending in the other segment  however  it expects that the impact from this increased spending on the company s bottom line will be mitigated by the planned sale of the common stock of panacos and the continued funding support in the area of pct 
interest expense the company had interest expense of  in versus  in the company had used its proceeds from its initial public offering and  at the end of the second quarter of  began to borrow funds from its revolving line of credit to continue its infrastructure and research and development investments 
in addition to a higher average borrowing balance in  the company realized the effects of rising interest rates 
income taxes the company recorded tax benefits at its combined federal and state statutory rate of for although the company realized consolidated operating losses for and  management believed that its valuation allowance was adequate as the company had planned to return to profitability within six to twelve months  at which point it would have begun to realize the benefit from its federal and state tax assets 
the tax benefit rate recognized in was adversely affected by the in process research and development charges discussed above 
the march technology license transaction resulted in a temporary difference as the technology license is deductible for tax purposes over a year period  while the september common stock acquisition resulted in a permanent difference that is never deductible 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item hereunder for further detail 
loss from continuing operations loss from continuing operations decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   as a result of the items discussed above 
discontinued operations the clinical laboratories services segment of the business  a discontinued operation  recorded income of  in as compared to a loss of  in this segment s growth was led by a increase in molecular testing as part of a increase in segment revenues  which more than offset a slight decline in that segment s service gross margin to in from in summary the company had a net loss of  in versus  in as a result of the operating loss which includes acquired research and development costs expensed in in the amount of  interest expense  and the tax benefit described above 
liquidity and financial condition in december  the company made a decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing services segment and in february  bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sold certain assets and liabilities to a third party for an aggregate purchase price of  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the company has retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl subsequent to the closing date  which the company intends to liquidate throughout the remainder of year as part of its decision to exit this segment of the business 
the company expects to record an after tax gain in the first quarter of closing costs include an estimate of costs associated with disposing of all remaining assets and retiring all existing liabilities including a facility lease 
the company expects to utilize in year certain prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company in year  to offset the tax effect of this future gain 
in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company is required to operate the business in a normal fashion for a minimum of six months subsequent to the sale but in no event longer than one year from the date of sale  substantially all costs associated with operation of the business subsequent to the closing date will be borne by the purchaser 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to redeem all outstanding senior subordinated convertible debentures and to retire the company s line of credit  as discussed further hereunder 
in august  the company issued  of senior subordinated convertible debentures due august  net proceeds to the company amounted to approximately  after deduction of original issue discount of  and associated closing costs of  for accounting purposes  a portion of the cash proceeds  amounting to  has been allocated to the relative fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with these debentures 
in the first quarter of  certain holders of the company s outstanding senior convertible debentures the debentures exercised their rights to convert  of such debentures into shares of the company s common stock  in accordance with the conversion formula 
the conversion of a portion of these outstanding debentures and or the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase the company s common stock will have a dilutive impact on our security holders 
the conversion price of the debentures was the lower of i a share or ii of the average of the five lowest volume weighted average sales prices of common stock as reported by bloomberg  lp during the business days immediately preceding the date on which any debenture holder notified the company that it will convert all or a part of their debenture into common stock 
the terms of the debenture entitled the company to redeem any of the outstanding debenture s at a redemption price equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the debenture s was then convertible times the average closing bid price as reported by bloomberg lp for the five trading days immediately prior to the date that the debenture s is called for redemption  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
these conversions resulted in the issuance of  additional shares of common stock subsequent to december  in addition  in the first quarter of  the company redeemed the remaining  of debentures at face value plus a  premium and accrued interest 
unamortized debt discount  debt issuance costs and warrant related costs associated with the converted debentures  approximating  will be reclassified as an offset to additional paid in capital  with the remaining  of such costs associated with the redeemed debentures being included in the loss on extinguishment of the debentures 
the company will also reverse approximately  of expenses  previously recorded in  associated with the debentures beneficial conversion feature 
as a result of the above items  the company expect to record a net loss of approximately  relative to this early extinguishment of debt  in the first quarter of as a result of both the conversions and redemptions  which occurred in the first quarter of  none of the  senior subordinated convertible debentures remain outstanding subsequent to february  the company s working capital position as of december  was adversely affected by the classification of its  line of credit balance as short term debt 
the company reclassified the debt because in  it violated a financial covenant limiting the amount of allowable losses 
in the first quarter of  utilizing proceeds generated by the sale of certain assets of bbicl as discussed above  the company paid off in full the  outstanding balance plus accrued interest  thereby terminating this line of credit 
there were no payment defaults at any time on this line of credit 
in october  the company formed a new  wholly owned subsidiary  panacos pharmaceuticals  inc panacos  a delaware corporation 
all of the company s technology related to its drug discovery and vaccine programs  consisting primarily of patents and related sponsored research agreements  were transferred to panacos effective january in accordance with its strategic plans  panacos obtained additional equity financing from third party investors in november as the first step in raising the substantial amount of capital required to progress to more advanced stages of drug development including human clinical trials 
as a result of the new equity financing  the company retained a interest in non voting preferred shares of panacos 
accordingly  subsequent to november   the company no longer consolidates panacos results of operations  nor is the company required to fund any further research and development activities of panacos 
in april  the company borrowed  net of issuance costs under a mortgage agreement on its west bridgewater  ma facility 
the company used these funds to reduce the outstanding balance on its line of credit 
the mortgage is due on march  during the first five years the note carries an interest rate of  after five years the rate charged will be greater than the bank base rate then in effect 
under this mortgage agreement the company is subject to certain financial covenants by which a default in its line of credit covenants will cause a default on this note 
the company has received a waiver from this lending institution regarding the covenant violation 
payments due on this mortgage are based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment representing the remaining balance due in full on march  in february  the company received notice that paradigm group  llc exercised all of its warrants to purchase the company s common stock 
this exercise was expected to result in proceeds to the company of approximately  the holders of the warrants were required to pay the exercise price when the registration of the underlying shares became effective which was in december in august  the company received a summons and complaint from paradigm group  llc naming the company as a defendant 
the suit  filed in the circuit court of cook county  illinois  alleged breach of contract claims and fraud against the company in connection with the sale by the company to the paradigm group  llc of the above warrants  the exercise of those warrants by paradigm group  llc and a delay in the registration of those shares with the us securities and exchange commission 
in december  paradigm group  llc withdrew this lawsuit 
the company believes it is entitled to the funds due from the exercise of the above warrants  however  it has fully reserved the receivable as of december  pending receipt of payment 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  the company expensed approximately  of costs incurred related to these warrants and the registration of the underlying shares 
the shares related the exercise of these warrants are outstanding from the date the warrants were exercised through the end of the year and have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share 
the company has outstanding warrants  with various strike prices  which are exercisable for a total of  shares of common stock 
this represents approximately of the company s issued and outstanding common stock based on the number of shares issued and outstanding as of december  net cash used in continuing operations for the year ended december  was  as compared to cash use of  for year this increase in operational use of cash was primarily the result of higher operating losses 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year versus  for the year during  the company s bbi biotech segment invested  to build out its new repository facility in frederick  maryland  and approximately  relative to the company s investment in panacos pharmaceuticals as discussed further above 
in addition  significant investments were made for laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
expenditures in included approximately  of computer hardware and software  of which  was invested in new enterprise resource planning systems for the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments of the business  this latter amount includes approximately  of general and administrative costs capitalized by the company relative to the implementation of its erp system in cash provided by financing activities was  in versus  in during  the net cash provided by debt consisted of the mortgage of approximately  and the debentures and related warrants of approximately  and  respectively  as discussed above  less net repayments on the line of credit of  in addition  cash of approximately  was received in year from the exercise of stock options and warrants  exclusive of the  warrants associated with the paradigm group llc as discussed herein 
as of march   the company had existing cash balances approximating  excluding  of restricted cash relating to final post closing adjustments associated with the sale of certain bbicl assets as discussed herein and believes this amount coupled with internally generated cash flows will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the next year 
the company continually evaluates financing options  as well as other strategic alternatives  in order to maximize shareholder value 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  is effective for quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
the company does not currently engage in derivative trading or hedging activity so it does not believe that adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its financial statements 
in late the and early  the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on a number of revisions to eitf issue no 
accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversions features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios 
the securities and exchange commission s sec observer to the eitf indicated the sec s preference that the revision relative to the computation of a beneficial conversion features associated with convertible securities be applied to all securities issued after may  the company has therefore applied this adjusted calculation to the beneficial conversion feature associated with its august issuance of  of senior subordinated convertible debentures and accordingly  the company has included the effects of the revisions  as indicated by the sec staff member 
approximately  of this revised computation is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying financial statements
