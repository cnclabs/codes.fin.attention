net revenue is composed primarily of software license revenue and service fee revenue 
service fee revenue increased in and over the previous years  but the company s software license revenue in experienced its first year over year decline since software license revenue decreased across all of the company s product lines 
in  accounting software license revenue  which accounted for of the company s total software license revenue decreased  while estimating license revenue  which accounted for of the total software license revenue  decreased 
the company believes the decrease in the accounting software license revenue was primarily due to the decrease in the demand for software 
many companies in the few years prior to upgraded or replaced their existing software that was not year compliant  resulting in lower demand in additionally  because of the uncertainty in the us economy and signs of a slowdown in the construction industry during the latter part of  the company believes many prospective buyers delayed their computer software purchasing decision 
partially offsetting the effect of the decline in the demand was additional revenue from new products introduced in these new products include the purchase order and inventory applications  which were introduced at the end of and service management applications  which were introduced in august these applications enable the company to penetrate the specialty contractor market  which is a new area the company has targeted to further expand into the various segments of the construction industry 
estimating software revenue declined in compared to  primarily as a result of a large software order in  which was the single largest software order in the company s history 
excluding that order from  estimating software revenue in increased slightly over in  accounting software license revenue  which accounted for of the company s total software license revenue  increased over and estimating software license revenue  which account for of total software license fees  increased 
the increase in accounting software revenue was primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from the company s gold collection for construction accounting 
the company believes this increase was primarily due to three factors the continued strength in the construction industry  the increasing dominance of our products in our targeted markets  and the need by many companies to upgrade or replace their existing software which was not year compliant 
estimating software revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to an estimating software licensing arrangement during the first quarter of  which was the single largest software order in the company s history 
in terms of revenue mix  software license revenue accounted for  and of net revenue in  and  respectively 
a large majority of software licensing arrangements are made in the united states 
international non us software revenue  as a percentage of total software revenue  increased slightly in to from for and service fee revenue is comprised primarily of fees from annual maintenance and support service plans and fees for consulting and training 
the increase in service fee revenue was due to the increase in revenue from annual maintenance and support service plans 
revenue from these plans  which comprised of the total service fee revenue for  increased over this was partially offset by a decline in consulting and training revenue  primarily due to a lower demand for these services as a direct result of the decline in the company s software license revenue 
service fee revenue in increased significantly over primarily due to an increase in revenue from annual maintenance and support service plans 
fees from these service plans  which accounted for over of the company s total service fees in  increased  primarily due to the increase in the company s user base through new product sales  the revision in the pricing structure for these plans which was instituted during the first quarter of  and an increase in the percentage of users renewing their annual service plans 
the company also believes the increase was due to a higher quality of service being provided to its users as a result of a significant re engineering and restructuring of the way it provides telephone support 
consulting fees in increased over the prior year 
although this is not a large percentage of net revenue  the company targeted this area as a source for future growth 
training fees in remained essentially flat compared to because  in the latter part of  the company transferred the primary responsibility of holding training classes for users to its reseller channel 
the reduction in training revenue was offset with increased sales of training materials 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of software documentation  assembly and shipping costs  royalties paid to outside developers  amortization of capitalized software development costs and cost of facilities and outside services for training and consulting 
cost of revenue in increased slightly  and as a percentage of net revenue  increased to from in the increase was primarily due to an increase in royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of revenue increased significantly in over  but as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at 
the increase in the dollar amount for cost of revenue was primarily due to higher costs related to software license and consulting revenue 
these sources of revenue increased significantly in over operating expenses 
operating expenses amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
these expenses increased in and in over the previous years 
as a percentage of net revenue  operating expenses increased to in from in and in client services expenses increased in primarily as a result of an increase in personnel and internal training costs in order to manage and service the increased level and quality of support services being provided to its customers 
the call volume to the company s client services group in increased over s level 
internal training costs increased due to the new products added during the year and an increase in the number of people who needed to be trained 
the company doubled its internal training staff from a year ago in order to properly train its employees  certified consultants and trainers on the new products as well as to train new employees on the company s existing products 
as a percentage of service fees  client services expenses increased to in from in client services expenses increased in over primarily due to two factors 
about a third of the increase was due to an increase in personnel costs for performing consulting services  for which the company s revenue from this service grew in the remainder of the increase is primarily related to higher personnel costs required to retain and hire highly qualified technical support specialists to handle the telephone support volume and outside costs incurred to assist the company in re engineering and restructuring the customer support organization to make it more efficient 
call volume in increased about over the previous year  while support staff dedicated to this function remained fairly constant 
as a percentage of service fees  customer support expenses decreased to in from in product development expenses represent expenses for research on new software products as well as enhancements and ongoing updates to the company s existing software products 
in and  product development expenses increased over the previous years  primarily due to an increase in personnel and the additional use of outside contract developers to maintain and enhance the company s current software products 
personnel costs were also higher due to the competitive environment for attracting and retaining highly qualified people in the local area in which the company s operations are located 
the company is continually working on a number of enhancements to its existing product lines to meet the needs of its existing customers and to improve the marketability of the products 
the company has also added new products in  which increased the number of software applications that must be maintained and enhanced 
consequently  the company believes that it will continue to commit a significant amount of its resources toward product development in sales and marketing expenses increased in over and also increased as a percentage of net revenue 
a portion of the increase was due to an increase in sales personnel 
the company opened a sales office in sydney australia during the first quarter of to increase its presence in the asia pacific region and to provide better support to its distribution channel in that region 
the company also added sales personnel to boost its software revenue in certain areas within the us where the company believed it had a greater opportunity to increase its current market share 
sales personnel were also added as the company targeted two additional segments within the construction industry the specialty contractors and owners and design build firms to market its products and services 
marketing expenses increased due to increased personnel  advertising  trade show costs and outside service costs 
the company is aggressively marketing into the two segments mentioned above 
the company spent additional funds in on a new marketing campaign and public relations to increase its presence in these new areas  as well as to gain more exposure to its customers and prospects of its e commerce and project management strategy 
sales and marketing expenses in increased significantly over  but as a percentage of net revenue  declined slightly from the previous year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and trade show costs in the marketing area  increased sales commissions related to the company s direct sales  and an increase in international marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased over in both absolute dollar amounts and as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase was primarily due to increase in personnel costs  depreciation and amortization  and outside service costs 
the increase in personnel costs was primarily due to the company establishing a human resources and legal affairs group to coordinate these functions within the company 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to additional capital expenditures in and to expand the capabilities and functionality of its telecommunication system and information system  the latter of which became operational in september outside service costs increased primarily due to higher insurance and legal fees 
general and administrative expenses in increased slightly from the previous year  but declined as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in expense was primarily due to higher amortization expense  primarily related to the company s new information system which became operational in september  and an increase in outside service costs for insurance and legal services 
the increase in these costs was partially offset by the moving costs the company incurred in related to the move to its current corporate offices 
other income 
other income is primarily composed of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments 
other income increased in and primarily due to an increase in the amount of average funds invested in and over the previous year  and higher interest rates in provision for income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in this rate in over the previous two years is primarily due to the decrease in the company s pre tax earnings and a greater effect of the research tax credit on its effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company generally meets its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations 
net cash provided by operations was  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the changes in the amount of cash generated from operations from year to year were primarily due to the level of profitability during those years 
working capital decreased in primarily due to large uses of cash and an increase in deferred revenues during the year  which are further discussed below 
the company s financial position continues to be strong 
the company has no long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments amounted to  at december  and represent of the company s total assets 
these cash resources have decreased  since the end of  primarily due to the company s investment in product development on new applications supporting its e commerce and project management strategy  capital expenditures  and share repurchases under the company s stock repurchase plan 
during  the company expended  for capitalized software development costs 
the company also spent  to repurchase  shares  representing of the company s shares outstanding at march   the date that the company announced its share repurchase plan 
there remains shares that the company may repurchase under current authorization from the board of directors 
there are no current plans to increase the number of shares the company may repurchase beyond the amount previously authorized 
capital expenditures amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
normal capital expenditures are computers for new employees  periodic upgrades of existing computers for employees  and expansion of the company s telecommunication and internal information system 
in  there were additional capital expenditures for work related to the design of the future development and expansion of the company s corporate properties and productivity software for its client services group 
in  there were additional expenditures related to its new internal information system  which became operational in september the large amount of capital expenditures in was primarily related to the construction of the company s current corporate offices

accrued employee expenses decreased  primarily due to a decrease in employee bonuses for the year deferred income taxes increased primarily as a result of the deferred tax liability related to capitalized software development costs 
the company believes that its current cash balances and temporary investments  along with future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating needs for at least the next months 
the company plans to continue to invest significant resources toward product development  which may include internal software development  acquiring new technology or new products which will complement its existing product lines  and other strategic opportunities that arise 
other future cash needs will  or may  include additional investments for equipment for company personnel  upgrading and expanding its telecommunication and internal information systems  additional expenditures for expansion of the company s corporate offices  and the payment of cash dividends 
the company currently pays regular quarterly cash dividends and plans to continue to pay such dividends  consistent with its capital needs  income levels and its long term dividend policy 
total cash dividends paid in amounted to  or 
per share  compared to  or 
per share in and  or 
per share in although the company believes that it has sufficient cash and temporary investments on hand to meet its operating needs and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months  events may occur that require funds in excess of what the company has available 
if such events were to occur  the company may borrow money against its real properties or seek other debt or equity financing 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may make forward looking statements as such term is defined in the federal securities laws 
the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating the company s forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in such forward looking statements are as follows competition 
the computer software market is highly competitive and subject to change because of the rapid technological changes in the computer industry 
the number of software vendors with which the company competes varies from product to product and from region to region within the united states 
although the company believes it is a major supplier of accounting and cost estimating software for the construction and property management industries  and that there are economical and technological barriers to discourage new specialty software vendors from entering into its segment of the software market  there can be no assurance that larger  well known software developers will not target this segment of the market 
such competitors are considerably larger  more diversified  and have greater financial and other resources and enjoy greater brand recognition for their products than the company 
the company must also compete with other larger  well known software developers for the hiring and retention of highly qualified technical personnel 
as a result  the company may have to expend additional financial resources to hire and retain qualified technical personnel 
if the company is not able to secure the services of employees with the level of technical expertise it requires  the development of new products would likely be delayed and would result in a decrease in the quality of new software products and enhancements to its existing software products 
a delay in the development  or failure to maintain the quality of new software products by the company would likely have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
dependence on microsoft operating system  obsolescence and technological changes 
the company is a specialty software developer  an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
its software is designed to work with specific operating systems developed by microsoft corporation 
if substantial changes are made to those operating systems or if new operating systems are adopted  the company s software may not function properly  necessitating that the company invest additional resources to adapt its software to those changes 
also  other operating systems may be introduced on which the company s software may not function  which may also cause additional resources to be expended which would otherwise be devoted to improving the company s software or developing new software 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to make substantial expenditures for product development 
although the company plans to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop new products  the company s competitors may develop products with superior capabilities and or market their products more effectively at lower prices  by bundling their software with other software or through other methods 
the company believes its existing software products are widely accepted in its segment of the marketplace 
however  a delay in the release of new products or modifications to existing products  or a delay in the acceptance by the marketplace of any new products or modifications to existing products  could similarly delay the recognition of revenue  or have an adverse effect on the company s revenue and earnings 
substantial dependence on single industry 
because the company sells a large majority of its software products and services to the construction industry  adverse economic conditions in that industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenue and earnings 
the construction industry is particularly sensitive to a significant increase in interest rates  which in the past has resulted in substantial financial distress across the industry 
in addition  a downturn in general economic conditions in the united states could adversely affect the construction industry 
product protection 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it by relying upon copyrights  trade secrets  internal nondisclosure agreements and transferability restrictions incorporated into its software license agreements 
the company believes the risk of unauthorized transfers of the company s proprietary information is reduced because program source listings are not released to third parties 
despite these restrictions  it may be possible for competitors or users to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain information which the company regards as proprietary 
the company s competitive position could be adversely affected by unauthorized use of its proprietary information 
third parties may also assert infringement or other claims against the company with respect to any existing or future products 
litigation to protect the company s proprietary information or to determine the validity of any third party claims could result in significant expense to the company and  whether or not such litigation is determined in favor of the company  divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel from further development and support of the company s software products
