operating revenues portfolio and enterprise risk management 
portfolio and enterprise risk management fees consist of annual subscription fees and other related revenues for our core business portfolio risk management and enterprise risk management systems 
a summary of the components of these revenues is as follows amounts in thousands change from change from prior year prior year core product subscriptions continuing products    core product subscriptions discontinued fixed income products  other core product related    total    core product subscriptions are revenues for our portfolio risk management and enterprise risk management products  including related data updates 
we generally bill and collect these fees on an annual basis  but recognize the income th per month over each year of the subscription period 
the growth in annual subscription fees continues to be generated from a combination of obtaining new clients and increasing revenues from existing customers through the introduction of new products  features  users and other services 
for compared to  annual subscription fee revenue for continuing products increased approximately 
for compared to  annual subscription fee revenue for continuing products increased approximately 
revenue growth was primarily driven by sales of our new enterprise risk management software  which had a increase in revenues in  and sales of our equity models and related data reflecting the continued success of our aegis suite of products 
revenues from discontinued fixed income products represent annual subscription fees and related revenues associated with our us single country fixed income model which we discontinued as part of a restructuring plan in april revenues for only represent amounts earned on these products during april as part of the restructuring  we agreed to provide license and support services without charge from may  until the product termination dates 
the termination dates ranged from october to december other core product related revenues include consulting and implementation fees associated with enterprise risk management system installations  timesharing revenues  seminar revenues and one time fees 
the increase in these revenues from to reflects increases in implementation and consulting fees from enterprise risk management system installations and other recurring and one time fees  offset by declines in timeshare and other one time fees 
the increase in implementation and consulting fees reflects growth in the installed base for our enterprise risk software 
the decline in timeshare revenues is the result of discontinuing our timesharing product platform at the end of calendar our timesharing revenues have decreased over the past few years as we have converted our timesharing platform products to operate on our clients in house computers 
the increase in these revenues from to was primarily due to implementation and consulting fees on enterprise risk management systems  which coincided with the launch of that product line in june symphony 
our asset management revenues increased million or in over and increased million or in compared to symphony s revenues consist primarily of asset management fees  which are a fixed percentage of asset value  and performance fees  which are based on the performance over a benchmark for each client account 
performance fees included in total revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
performance fees are recognized only at the measurement date for determining performance of an account 
the measurement date typically is at the end of the first year of a client s contract and on each subsequent annual anniversary date for the years after the first year 
the performance fee increases in and were principally the result of investment performance exceeding benchmarks as well as the fact that assets under management that were subject to performance fees grew significantly in both of those years 
as of the beginning of fiscal  symphony had approximately billion of assets under direct management a decrease of over the beginning of fiscal 
billion of these assets are managed under agreements that provide for performance fees in addition to a base management fee 
these amounts include approximately million of leverage associated with performance fee accounts in addition to the capital invested by symphony clients 
average assets under management for were billion compared to million for symphony s future revenues will depend to a great extent on the performance of the funds it manages and the timing of anniversary fee determination dates for performance based funds 
it is estimated that approximately and of the current total of performance based funds under symphony s management will have performance determination dates in the quarters ended june and september  respectively 
the pattern of these anniversaries can change from quarter to quarter because of the addition  termination and re negotiation of account agreements 
on june   barra and maestro signed an agreement to sell symphony llc to nuveen 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
posit 
our electronic trading revenues increased million or in compared to and increased million or in over our revenues from posit come from royalties based on commissions generated by the trading volume in the various posit systems 
shares traded in the us posit system were billion  billion and billion  for calendar years ended december   and  respectively 
our posit revenue increases reflect higher trading volumes on us posit offset in part by a decline in royalties from euro posit in see note in the consolidated financial statements 
other ventures 
revenues from other ventures include our global estimates  bond express  barra rogerscasey and strategic consulting businesses 
we sold our global estimates business in december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this sale 
revenues from global estimates and bond express primarily consist of subscription fees to earnings estimates products and bond offering databases 
the investment consulting division of barra rogerscasey provides services to pension plan sponsors usually under recurring  retainer based fee arrangements 
the strategic consulting venture provides consulting services to asset managers  which are generally non recurring  project type engagements that are completed in phases 
as a group  revenues from these ventures increased million or in compared to and increased million or in over revenues from non us customers 
the percentage of our total operating revenues that come from our non us customers represented  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage of revenues derived from our non us customers declined both from to and to as a result of significant increases in asset management revenues  which are all us based 
the percentage of our portfolio and enterprise risk management and other ventures revenues that come from non us customers has remained unchanged at approximately for the last three fiscal years 
operating expenses communications  data and seminar 
communications  data and seminar consists of our computer access charges  software and data costs  computer leasing and seminar expenses 
this component of operating expenses remained almost unchanged from to and decreased million or in over the decrease in was the result of lower computer leasing and access charges due to the termination of our vax based platform for fixed income and equity models in also contributing to the decrease were lower software and seminar expenses 
software expenses declined due to lower amortization on previously capitalized amounts as a result of writing off capitalized software costs in associated with discontinued fixed income products 
seminar expenses decreased as a result of fewer events in compensation and benefits 
our compensation and benefits increased million or in over and increased million or in over increases in our compensation and benefits costs for compared to were primarily the result of increases in incentive compensation at symphony 
symphony s incentive compensation costs are computed as a percentage of their operating profits and therefore are adjusted based on profitability 
the increase from to was primarily due to higher incentive compensation to symphony  along with higher year yk project related costs and increases in employee related benefit costs 
this increase was offset partially by a reduction in our average full time employee headcount of approximately 
yk related costs for outside consultants and special yk bonuses amounted to million in and million in this increase was due to greater use of outside consultants combined with special additional incentive compensation for employees involved with the yk project 
our annual salary administration and performance evaluation process results in annual reviews and salary adjustments that are effective as of july of each year 
occupancy 
our occupancy costs increased 
million or in over and decreased 
million or in over the increase in costs in over resulted primarily from new office space being leased in tokyo along with scheduled rent increases in existing office space 
the decrease in occupancy costs for reflects additional sublease income from leasing some of our excess facilities as well as charging a portion of some facility costs related to supporting discontinued fixed income products to the restructuring charge during other operating expenses 
our other operating expenses increased million or in compared to and decreased million or in compared to our other operating expenses include travel  office  maintenance  depreciation  amortization  marketing  advertising  outside legal and accounting services  business insurance  data  foreign currency translation gain loss and other expenses related to the asset management operations  and other corporate expenses 
increases in other operating expenses in compared to consisted primarily of increases in marketing and related expenses associated with our branding campaign and higher foreign currency translation losses  primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the pound against the dollar 
decreases in other operating expenses from to consisted primarily of lower costs for printing and postage  data costs related to asset management activities  professional services  and amortization of intangibles 
the decreases in printing and postage reflect lower costs for product distribution due to greater use of electronic delivery systems 
data costs associated with asset management activities declined due to lower negotiated rates in the decrease in amortization of intangibles reflects our april restructuring and the write off of goodwill associated with discontinued fixed income products 
decreases in professional services reflect the absence of any significant expenses relating to legal or other corporate activities in growth rates in various other operating expenses were also lower as a result of the restructuring plans implemented during loss on sale of global estimates business 
refer to note in the consolidated financial statements for information on this loss 
non recurring acquisition charges  write off of goodwill and capitalized software costs and restructuring costs 
in april  our management announced and implemented a restructuring plan to reduce the cost of operating our us fixed income business and focus future development and sales efforts on global and enterprise wide fixed income products 
the restructuring plan discontinued certain us fixed income products and eliminated various sales  client and product support positions and related facilities within the us revenues from discontinued products ceased on april  customers who had prepaid subscriptions for periods after april  received refunds by august  although the decision to discontinue these products was made in april  certain support activities continued through december  we recorded two significant charges in connection with the april restructuring plan 
the first charge of  was recorded in the quarter ending march  it consisted of a write off of goodwill and capitalized software development costs related to discontinued products and is included in non recurring acquisition charges and write off of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

this restructuring plan consisted principally of closing four offices  canceling one of our most significant outside computing services contracts  and terminating approximately employees 
all termination notices and benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to march  we recorded a charge of  in connection with this restructuring plan 
other income and expenses interest income and other 
our interest income and other increased 
million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to the increase in reflects higher interest earnings due to substantially higher average invested cash balances in the current year 
the increase in was primarily the result of a million gain on the sale of lycos  inc stock 
we received the lycos stock in exchange for our shares of quote 
com inc  which was acquired by lycos in december also contributing to the increase in were higher gains on marketable equity securities held for trading 
equity in net income and loss of investees 
net losses from our joint ventures and other strategic relationships represent primarily our share of losses from our equity investments in alacra formerly data downlink corporation  risk reporting limited  global posit and australian posit 
the decrease in losses in the current year reflects a lower loss for risk reporting limited combined with increased income from australian posit 
the decrease in losses for reflects the liquidation of our investment in global posit during and the dilution of our investment in alacra in below ownership 
we no longer exercise significant influence in those operations and accordingly no longer include their losses in our results

increases or decreases in minority interest reflect corresponding changes in the level of profits from the symphony venture 
foreign currency as an international corporation  our business generates revenues from clients throughout the world

additionally  our consolidated subsidiary  barra japan  generates revenues  has expenses and has assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen 
all other things being equal  weakening of the us dollar has a positive impact on profits  and strengthening of the us dollar has a negative impact 
in september  we implemented a hedging program to help reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currency translation rates from holding net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the program utilizes forward contracts for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge our net asset exposure  consisting principally of cash and receivables denominated in pounds  euros and yen 
at march   we had one contract to sell million yen at  maturing on may   with an unrealized gain of  also at march   we had one contract to sell million euro at  maturing on may   with an unrealized gain of  additionally  at march   we had one contract to sell million pounds at  maturing on may   with an unrealized gain of  we enter into forward currency contracts only with approved counterparties and all hedging activities are reviewed by our foreign exchange committee 
our hedging program is currently designed only to reduce our exposure to gains and losses that result from translating our foreign assets and liabilities into u 
s dollars 
it does not currently limit or reduce the exposure we have from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our reported revenues that are billed in non us currencies 
for compared to  the us dollar strengthened against the pound  euro and the yen 
the resulting net effect of these movements in average exchange rates on operating revenues and net income was an decrease of approximately  and  respectively

see note in the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portions of our direct investment portfolio 
we place our direct investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing only in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the direct investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
our direct interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of investments in short term  high credit quality money market funds and us treasury securities 
these investments totaled approximately million at march  with an average interest rate of approximately 
at march   the portfolio also had approximately million of short term  high credit quality municipal debt securities with an average taxable equivalent interest rate of 
the short term money market funds  u 
s treasury securities and the municipal debt securities are not insured and because of the short term nature of the investments are subject to credit risk  but are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
from time to time  we provide the initial invested funds for the startup of new investment products offered by symphony 
in these cases the primary considerations are related to supporting a new business rather than making investments that fall under the guidelines of our investment policy 
our investments in market neutral programs  which amounted to approximately million at march   are non interest bearing and consist principally of long and short positions placed directly through other fund managers in u 
s and non us equity securities of both public and private issuers 
although the intent of the managers of these funds is to structure portfolios that are hedged against general market movements  these investments can be subject to significant changes in market value and are not insured 
all investment decisions with respect to these market neutral programs are made by professional investment advisers and the performance of the funds is reviewed periodically by our management and our board of directors

foreign currency risk we invoice customers in europe in both pounds and euros 
in japan  we bill our customers in yen 
excluding customers in these locations  we generally bill for our services in us dollars 
to the extent we invoice our customers in local currency yen  pound and euro  our international revenues are subject to currency exchange fluctuation risk 
to the extent that international revenues that are invoiced in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
currency fluctuations may also effectively increase the cost of our products and services in countries in which customers are invoiced in us dollars 
see the discussion in item  other income and expenses foreign currency  for further information on foreign currency and hedging practices 
we have no foreign debt and non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs
