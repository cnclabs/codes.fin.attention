our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below in factors that may affect operating results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear beginning on page f we are a leading provider of e business infrastructure software products that enable business to business  business to consumer and business to employee solutions 
we are the successor to a portion of the business of teknekron software systems  inc teknekron developed software  known as the tib technology  for the integration and delivery of market data  such as stock quotes  news and other financial information  in trading rooms of large banks and financial services institutions 
in  teknekron expanded its development efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and disparate manufacturing equipment and software applications primarily in the semiconductor fabrication market to communicate within the factory environment 
teknekron was acquired by reuters group plc  the global news and information group  in following the acquisition  continued development of the tib technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services markets 
in january  our company  tibco software inc  was established as an entity separate from teknekron 
we were formed to create and market software solutions for use in the integration of business information  processes and applications in diverse markets and industries outside the financial services sector 
in connection with our establishment as a separate entity  reuters transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to the intellectual property incorporated into some of our current software products 
reuters also assigned to us at that time license and service contracts primarily within the high tech manufacturing and energy markets  including contracts with nec  motorola  mobil and chevron 
our software products enable businesses to link internal operations  business partners and customer channels in real time 
our software products allow multiple distinct applications  web sites  databases and other content sources to be integrated and managed within a common framework

our core technology  known as the information bus or the tib  is software that enables enterprises and users to automatically transmit  receive  filter and personalize digital information in real time 
the information bus also facilitates real time  two way communications between applications across distributed computer networks and mobile information devices such as hand held computers  pagers and digital cellular phones 
our products are currently in use by over  companies in diverse markets such as telecommunications  manufacturing  energy  financial services and internet portals 
during fiscal  we expanded our product development activities and continued to invest in creating a product marketing organization  engaging in advertising programs to build our corporate brand identity 
we also built our domestic and international direct sales force and created a general and administrative infrastructure 
during the second half of fiscal  we began initial shipments of our tibco activeenterprise products  to companies such as pagenet  philips medical  compaq and com 
we also formally introduced our tibco 
net product and service offering for creating and managing e business activities  and generated revenue from yahoo and netscape for enabling their stock quotation services 
during fiscal  we added approximately new customers for our tibco activeenterprise and tibco 
net products  and we strengthened our position in our key vertical markets telecommunication  internet portals  manufacturing  energy and financial services 
new customers included at t  altavista  aol netscape  procter and gamble  sap  philips  enron  chemdex  ft 
com  ericsson  siemens  williams communications and sprint

these companies included ariba  cisco systems  oracle  sun microsystems  sap  yahoo portal software  avantgo  deloitte consulting  selectica  i technologies  siebel systems  and sybase 
we also released the tib portalbuilder  a product for the creation and management of portals 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on strengthening our position in our significant vertical markets and our relationships with major system integrators such a kpmg  cap gemini ernst young and deloitte touche 
we also introduced our tibco activeexchange product suite  which is used to more dynamically and collaboratively automate interactions among businesses 
in addition  we added more than new customers during fiscal  including such industry leaders as agilent  el paso energy  schering plough  enron corporation  and the limited 
our revenue in fiscal and consisted primarily of license and product fees from our customers and distributors  including from reuters pursuant to our license agreement with it  both of which were primarily attributable to sales of our tibco activeenterprise product suite 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing project integration services 
we also receive revenue from our tibco 
net customers 
revenue from these customers is a combination of fixed service charges  a percentage of the advertising fees generated from their tibco 
net enabled web pages and a charge for each user visit to these web pages 
we also receive revenues from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop any maintenance revenue included in these arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  which is generally subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
we recognize service revenue as the services are performed or on the percentage of completion method of accounting  depending on the nature of the project 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized is that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs  based on current estimates of the costs to complete the project 
to the extent that these arrangements include license fees  such fees are recorded as license revenue based on the percentage of completion ratio 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized currently 
our distributors generally pay us negotiated royalties on their sales of our products 
reuters distributes our products to customers in the financial services market segment 
through december  reuters must pay us product fees based on a percentage of the revenue it derives from the sale of licenses and maintenance for our products 
under our license agreement with reuters  minimum guaranteed product fees were million in calendar and million in calendar and are million in calendar we recognized million in fees from reuters in fiscal we will recognize revenue in the amount of these guaranteed product fees ratably over the contractual period 
in any period where actual product fees exceed the minimum guaranteed product fees for the year  the actual product fees and cumulative minimum guaranteed product fees will be recognized as revenue

license revenue license revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
license revenue increased million  or  from to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales from a broader suite of products 
license revenue increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales of our tibco activeenterprise products 
license revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue reflect our strategy of pursuing a license driven business model  the increasing acceptance of our products in key vertical markets and the expansion of our relationships with systems integrators which effectively leverages our direct sales of software products 
we believe that license revenues will grow in absolute dollars and will increase slightly as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal service and maintenance revenue service and maintenance revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal service and maintenance revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily a result of additional maintenance revenue related to the growth in license revenue 
we believe service and maintenance revenue in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue as license revenue continues to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and third party contractor and associated expenses related to providing project implementation services  the cost of providing maintenance and customer support services  and royalties

cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation charges  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal cost of revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal and resulted from increased service and maintenance revenue and the decreases as a percentage of total revenue were due primarily to increases in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue

research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases were due primarily to increases in our development staff as we continued to expand the product suites and upgrade the performance of existing products 
research and development expenses were  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect that spending on research and development will continue to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff and the cost of marketing programs  including advertising  trade shows  promotional materials and customer conferences 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases resulted primarily from the continued expansion of our domestic and international direct sales force in order to sell our expanding suite of products 
sales and marketing expenses were  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to increase staff in our direct sales organization and to develop product marketing and branding campaigns and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars for fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive  legal  finance  accounting  human resources and information technology 
general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and million  or  from fiscal to fiscal these increases were primarily a result of increased staffing and associated operational costs related to building our general and administrative infrastructure 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal as we develop our infrastructure to support a rapidly growing global company 
stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non employee directors during fiscal and  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price of such options 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable option and is shown by expense category 
we expect to amortize million  million  million and million of unearned stock based compensation in fiscal   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to employees and non employee directors was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method as prescribed by fasb interpretation no 
 and is shown by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re value the stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants prior to the company s initial public offering  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of november   we expect to amortize stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal  assuming no change in the underlying value of our common stock 
we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million in connection with the acquisition of extensibility inc related to unvested options that were assumed as well as stock that was issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition  which is being held in an escrow account 
this amount is amortized over the vesting period of the options and the stock  and is shown by expense category 
we expect to amortize million  million  million and million of unearned stock compensation related to the extensibility acquisition in fiscal   and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to the unvested portion of options assumed and restricted stock granted in connection with the acquisition of extensibility was million in fiscal in fiscal  the company recognized million as stock compensation expense related to the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercise of non qualified stock options 
acquired in process research and development management estimated that million of the purchase price of extensibility inc in fiscal and million of the purchase price of inconcert  inc in fiscal represented acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisitions 
development projects which had not reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses  were classified as iprd 
the value of iprd was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
if the projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected in future periods 
amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangibles was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles of million recorded in connection with the acquisition of extensibility in august are being amortized over their useful lives of two to five years 
during the fourth quarter of  million of goodwill and other acquired intangibles were recorded in connection with the asset purchase of inconcert 
these items which are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
other income  net other income  net includes interest and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
other income  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances following the successful completion of our follow on offering in march and realized gains on equity securities  offset by losses on certain investments in emerging companies 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to interest income earned from our investments which increased significantly as a result of the money raised in connection with our initial public offering in july as a result of current market conditions  we may incur additional charges on our investments in emerging companies in the future 
income taxes in fiscal  a million provision was recorded for federal  state  and foreign taxes 
at november   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and million excluding stock compensation deductions  and million and million including stock compensation deductions  for federal and california  respectively  which expire through and  respectively

cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in fiscal and and our preferred stock in at november   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we anticipate continued growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future  particularly in sales and marketing expenses and  to a lesser extent  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we expect to use our cash resources to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures  and additionally  to fund acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec issued sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin summarizes certain sec s views in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us to revenue recognition in financial statements 
based on the sec s timeline for implementing sab  the company would be required to comply with the guidelines in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating sab and does not expect its implementation will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in forward looking statements related to our business 
we have a history of losses and we expect future losses  and if we do not achieve and sustain profitability our business will suffer and our stock price may decline 
although our revenue has increased in recent quarters  we may not be able to sustain our growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing organization and in our technology research and development 
we expect to continue to spend substantial financial and other resources on expanding our direct sales and marketing activities and developing and introducing enhancements to our existing products and new software products 
as a result  we need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we expect that our research and development expenses and our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
we intend to continue to increase staff in our direct sales organization and to develop producing marketing and branding campaigns and accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
our future revenue is unpredictable  and we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that event  our stock price would likely decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  our new business strategy and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we may have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including 
the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services by our competitors  
the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations  and 
the capital and expense budgeting decisions of our customers 
in addition  our quarterly operating results have historically been subject to variations throughout the year due to a general slow down in our sales in the summer months  particularly in europe 
specifically  we generally experience relatively lower revenue in our third fiscal quarter 
these seasonal variations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter throughout the year 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
as a result  a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods 
our licensing and distribution relationship with reuters places limitations on our ability to conduct our business 
we have a significant relationship with reuters for licensing and distribution 
our relationship with reuters involves limitations and restrictions on our business  as well as other risks  described below 
reuters has access to the intellectual property used in our products  and could use the intellectual property to compete with us 
we license the underlying tib messaging technology incorporated into some of our important tibco activeenterprise products from reuters 
we do not own this technology 
reuters is not restricted from using the tib technology to produce products that compete with our products  and it can grant limited licenses to the tib technology to others who may compete with us 
in addition  we must license all the intellectual property and products we create through december to reuters 
this will place reuters in a position to more easily develop products that compete with our product offerings 
we must rely on reuters and other distributors to sell our products in the financial services market  and they may not be successful in doing so 
under our agreements with reuters  we are restricted from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market and major competitors of reuters  and from using the tib technology we license from reuters to develop products specifically for use by these companies 
accordingly  we must rely on reuters and other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to these companies 
substantially all of our revenue from sales in the financial services market  excluding sales to cedel global services  consists of product fees paid to us by reuters 
although reuters is the preferred distributor of our products in the financial services market and is required to pay us guaranteed minimum product fee payments until the end of  reuters has no contractual obligation to distribute our products to financial services customers 
reuters and other distributors may not be successful in selling our products into the financial services market  or they may elect to sell competitive third party products into that market  either of which may adversely affect our revenue in that market 
our relationship with reuters restricts our ability to earn revenue from sales in the financial services market 
under the license agreement  reuters is required to pay us product fees based on a percentage of its revenue from sales of our products in the financial services market  excluding products that are embedded in any reuters products 
these product fees may be materially less than the product fees we could obtain from other distributors or resellers in the financial services market 
in addition  when we sell our products into the financial services market through third party distributors other than reuters  reuters receives a share of our license revenue 
our license agreement with reuters imposes practical restrictions on our ability to acquire other companies 
the license agreement places no specific restrictions on our ability to acquire companies with all or part of their business in the financial services market 
however  under the terms of the license agreement  we are prohibited from bundling or combining our products that are based on licensed technology with an acquired company s products and services and then selling the bundled or combined products directly to financial services companies 
this prohibition could prevent us from realizing potential synergies with companies we acquire 
the market for e business infrastructure software may not grow as quickly as we anticipate  which would cause our revenues to fall below expectations 
the market for e business infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our e business infrastructure software  including application integration software  and related services 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration  e business and information delivery and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for e business infrastructure software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands  and competitive pressures 
to this end  we may acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate them profitably  or retain their key employees 
for example  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of inconcert  inc in november and the acquisition of extensibility  inc 
in september integrating inconcert  extensibility or any other newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business  and could distract our management 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition in order to finance any acquisitions  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that results in dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to integrate inconcert  extensibility or any other newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  any amortization of goodwill or other assets or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our investment strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
as of november  we had invested million in companies with complementary technologies or products or which provide us with access to additional vertical markets and customers  and we plan to continue making such investments in the future 
the companies in which we invest are often at early stages of development  and no public market exists for their securities at the time of our investment 
these investments may not result in any meaningful commercial benefit to us  and our investments could lose all or a significant part of their value 
moreover  in certain circumstances  these investments could subject us to restrictions imposed by the investment company act of we might have to take actions  including  buying  refraining from buying  selling or refraining from selling securities when we would otherwise not wish to  in order to avoid registration under the investment company act of our stock price may be volatile  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology companies in particular  have recently experienced volatility which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
if market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments 
the rapid growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we are increasing the scope of our operations and we have recently increased our headcount substantially  both domestically and internationally 
our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to expand  train and manage our workforce worldwide 
accordingly  we believe that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to expand any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is years 
at the end of fiscal and fiscal  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value in the event market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points approximately of current rates in the portfolio from levels as of november   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  south america  asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets
