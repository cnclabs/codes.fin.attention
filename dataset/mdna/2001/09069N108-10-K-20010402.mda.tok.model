other matters in  the company recorded a million special charge against earnings in connection with an agreement in principle with respect to a civil settlement of the federal and state of tennessee investigation in connection with the conduct of two former officers of the company  prior to the company s initial public offering 
the definitive agreement covering this settlement was executed on june   and  among other things  provides for the execution and delivery by the company of a million promissory note secured by certain tangible assets 
from january through december   the company provided a broad range of pbm services on behalf of rxcare  to the tenncare r  tenncare r partners and other commercial pbm clients under the rxcare contract 
a majority of the company s revenues have been derived from providing pbm services in the state of tennessee to mcos participating in the state of tennessee s tenncare r program and bho s participating in the state of tennessee s tenncare r partners program 
from january through december   the company provided its pbm services to the tenncare r mcos as a subcontractor to rxcare 
the company and rxcare did not renew the rxcare contract  which expired on december  the negotiated termination of its relationship with rxcare  among other things  allowed the company to directly market its services to tennessee customers including those then under contract with rxcare prior to the expiration of the rxcare contract 
the rxcare contract had previously prohibited the company from soliciting and or marketing its pbm services in tennessee other than on behalf of  and for the benefit of  rxcare 
the company s marketing efforts resulted in the company executing agreements with all of the mcos for the tenncare r lives previously managed under the rxcare contract as well as substantially all tpas and employer groups previously managed under the rxcare contract 
the tenncare r program operates under a demonstration waiver from hcfa 
that waiver is the basis of the company s ongoing service to those mcos in the tenncare r program 
the waiver is due to expire on december  however  the company believes that pharmacy benefits will continue to be provided to medicaid and other eligible tenncare r enrollees through mcos in one form or another  although there can be no assurances that such pharmacy benefits will continue or that the company would be chosen to continue to provide pharmacy benefits to enrolles of a successor program 
if the waiver is not renewed and the company is not providing pharmacy benefits to those lives under a successor program or arrangement  then the failure to provide such services would have a material and adverse affect on the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the ongoing funding for the tenncare r program has been the subject of significant discussion at various governmental levels since its inception 
should the funding sources for the tenncare r program change significantly  the company s ability to serve those customers could be impacted and would also materially and adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
the ongoing funding for the tenncare r program has been the subject of significant discussion at various governmental levels for some time 
should the funding sources for the tenncare r program change significantly the company s ability to serve those customers could be impacted 
this would materially affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
on november   the tenncare r program adopted new rules for recipients to appeal adverse determinations in the delivery of health care services and products requiring prior approval including the rejections of certain pharmaceutical products under existing formularies or guidelines and to possibly receive a larger supply of the rejected products at the point of service 
the implementation of these rules may impact the quantity of formulary products excluded or requiring prior approval that are dispensed to the recipients potentially resulting in a change to the amount of pharmaceutical manufacturers rebates earned by the company 
a reduction in rebates would adversely impact the financial results of the company 
at this time the company cannot estimate the financial impact  if any  as a result of the implementation of new rules 
as a result of providing capitated pbm services to certain tenncare r mcos  the company s pharmaceutical claims costs historically have been subject to significant increases from october through february  which the company believes is due to the need for increased medical attention to  and intervention with  mcos members during the colder months 
the resulting increase in pharmaceutical costs impacts the profitability of capitated contracts 
capitated business represented approximately of the company s revenues while fee for service business including mail order services represented approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  as compared to and for the year ended december   respectively 
fee for service arrangements mitigate the adverse effect on profitability of higher pharmaceutical costs incurred under capitated contracts  as higher utilization positively impacts profitability under fee for service or non capitated arrangements 
the company presently anticipates that approximately of its revenues in fiscal will be derived from capitated arrangements 
changes in prices charged by manufacturers and wholesalers or distributors for pharmaceuticals  a component of pharmaceutical claims costs  directly affects the company s cost of revenue 
the company believes that it is likely that prices will continue to increase  which could have an adverse effect on the company s gross profit on capitated arrangements 
because plan sponsors are billed for the cost of all prescriptions dispensed in fee for service arrangements  the company s gross profit is not adversely affected by changes in pharmaceutical prices 
to the extent such cost increases adversely affect the company s gross profit  the company may be required to increase capitated contract rates on new contracts and upon renewal of existing capitated contracts 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining these rate increases 
the potential greater proportion of fee for service contracts with the company s customers in compared to prior years mitigates the potential adverse effects of price increases  although no assurance can be given that the recent trend towards fee for service arrangements will continue or that a substantial increase in drug costs or utilization would not negatively affect the company s overall profitability in any period 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability of the company to restrict its mco clients formularies to the extent anticipated by the company at the time contracted pbm services are implemented  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
there are currently no loss contracts and management does not believe that there is an overall trend towards losses on its existing capitated contracts 
in the first quarter of  the company commenced a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company intends to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in private transactions 
in february   the company repurchased  shares of common stock at a price of per share in private transactions 
see certain relationships and related transactions below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk represents the only market risk exposure applicable to the company 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt 
the company does not invest in or otherwise use derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents principal cash flow amounts and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates for the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk thereafter long term debt variable rate instruments weighted average rate in the table above  the weighted average interest rate for fixed and variable rate financial instruments was computed utilizing the effective interest rate for that instrument at december   and multiplying by the percentage obtained by dividing the principal payments expected in that year with respect to that instrument by the aggregate expected principal payments with respect to all financial instruments within the same class of instrument 
at december   the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  claims payable  payables to plan sponsors and others  and debt approximate fair value due to their short term nature 
because management does not believe that its exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  the company has not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk through the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
the company will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that risk as appropriate
