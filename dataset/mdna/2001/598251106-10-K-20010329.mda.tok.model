item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the periods indicated 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report 
overview the company s principal business is conducted by the banks and consists of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  other income and other expenses 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains  mortgage origination fees  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust fees and other income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  marketing expenses and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the company s asset liability management procedures in coping with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is dependent upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
other expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new banking centers and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage and other miscellaneous expenses 
during  the economy started to show signs of weakness  with rising energy prices  reports of slower economic growth and reports of tightening credit standards 
the federal reserve reduced the federal funds and discount rates by one and one half percent since the beginning of through march  the company s net income is dependent in part on stable interest rates 
falling rates may have some adverse implications for the company and its customers 
interest rate reductions would likely have the effect of compressing the company s net interest margin assuming that interest rates continue to fall 
a decrease in mortgage rates has sparked an increase in mortgage refinancing which has accelerated the prepayment speeds of the company s mortgage backed securities 
consolidated results of operations total assets increased million  or  to billion as of december  from billion as of december  net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the return on average assets was for and for the return on average equity increased to in from in the return on average assets was for both and the return on average equity increased to in from in compared to net interest income

in addition  the company issued million in junior subordinated debentures in june at a rate of with a maturity of years 
the average interest rate paid for borrowings increased to in from in due to increased interest rates on fhlb advances and the issuance of the company s junior subordinated debentures 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased from in to for the primary reason for the decrease in net interest margin was that yields on interest bearing liabilities increased more than the yields on earning assets

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased  or  to million in from million in as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans  and was equal to of nonperforming loans 
the amount of the provision for loan losses is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward nonperforming and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is also given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of impaired and other nonperforming loans  historical loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  independent loan review  the market value of collateral  the estimate of discounted cash flows  the strength and availability of guaranties  concentrations of credits and other factors

other income 
the company s total other income decreased  or  to million in from million in other income as a percentage of average assets was for the year ended compared to for the year ended the  decrease in total other income in from was primarily due to a  decrease in gains from all securities transactions  a  decrease in mortgage origination fees and a  decrease in trust income 
the decrease in mortgage origination fees was due to the overall increase in mortgage rates and the reduction in refinancing volume in compared to these decreases were offset  in part  by a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts resulting from increased volume and pricing  a  increase in insurance and brokerage fees  and a  increase in other income  including a  gain on the sale of other real estate during the growth in insurance and brokerage fees was primarily due to the full year impact of the porter insurance agency  inc acquisition in november and increased retail brokerage volumes during other expenses

changes in interest income and expense the changes in net interest income from period to period are reflective of changes in the interest rate environment  changes in the composition of assets and liabilities as to type and maturity and the inherent interest rate differences related thereto and volume changes 
later sections of this discussion and analysis address the changes in maturity composition of loans and investments  and in the asset and liability repricing gaps associated with interest rate risk  all of which contribute to changes in net interest margin 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in interest income and interest expense of the company s average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities for the indicated periods on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate in and tax rate in and the table distinguishes between the changes related to average outstanding balances changes in volume holding the interest rate constant and the changes related to average interest rates changes in average rate holding the outstanding balance constant

total loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  an increase of

the increase reflects increased demand due to increased working capital and equipment requirements both by existing borrowers and new customer relationships 
commercial real estate loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
the company has materially increased its lending efforts in this area while maintaining firm underwriting standards 
the company has added lending personnel to assist in this growth

the increase in agricultural loans reflects increased market share in west central illinois

consumer installment loans increased  to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
the increase reflects consumer demand for installment loans to finance consumable goods such as automobiles 
although the risk of nonpayment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the quality of the borrower s management and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type  such as commercial or residential  and fluctuating land values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan  as well as face the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
at the end of  the company had of the company s loan portfolio in commercial and consumer real estate loans  of these real estate loans are variable rate and of these real estate loans are fixed rate 
the company believes that most credits should have both a primary and a secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be supported by operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be disposition of collateral 
the company engages in very little unsecured lending and generally requires personal guarantees of principals for business obligations 
the company practices a system of concurrence in the approval of commercial credit whereby the documented concurrence of an officer s credit committee or approval by the board or a board committee  where applicable is obtained in addition to that of the recommending officer 
this system is intended to assure that commercial credit is subjected to an independent objective review on at least two different levels 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  one year years over years or less fixed variable fixed variable total in thousands commercial       commercial real estate       agricultural       consumer real estate       consumer installment    total loans  gross       unearned discount   total loans       nonperforming loans the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectibility of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all of the principal has been collected 
it is the policy of the company not to renegotiate the terms of a loan because of a delinquent status 
rather  a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 the company defined loans that are individually evaluated for impairment to include commercial loans and mortgages secured by commercial properties or five plus family residences that are in non accrual status or were restructured 
all other smaller balance loans with similar attributes such as auto are evaluated for impairment in total 
the classification of a loan as impaired or non accrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or non accrual loans 
the final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or non accrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans which are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows  or to the fair value of the related collateral  by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations cause the allowance for possible loan losses to require an increase  such increase is reported as a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense 
loans are evaluated for impairment when payments are delinquent days or more or when management downgrades the loan classification to doubtful 
the following table sets forth information on the company s nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets as of the indicated dates 
december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual and impaired loans not accruing      impaired and other loans days past due and accruing     total nonperforming loans      other real estate    total nonperforming assets      total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate total nonperforming assets to total assets during  and  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of   and  respectively 
nonperforming loans decreased  from million at december  to million at december   a decrease of 
the decrease in nonperforming loans was due to successful completion of specific loan workout situations  loan charge offs and transfers of foreclosed property collateral to other real estate for potential sale and liquidation 
other real estate decreased by million from december  to december  on march   the company sold a piece of other real estate with a fair value of million 
the sales price was approximately the fair value 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for possible loan losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the banks meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
each loan officer grades these individual commercial credits  and the company s independent loan review function validates the officers grades 
in the event that loan review downgrades the loan  it is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg collateral value is nominal 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is comprised of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation  and subjectively by determined allocation 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas nos 
and  and an allocation is made based on this analysis 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the credit rating of the loan 
the subjective portion is determined based on loan history and the company s evaluation of various factors including future economic and industry outlooks 
in addition  the subjective portion of the allowance is influenced by current economic conditions and trends in the portfolio including delinquencies and impairments  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses is consistent with prior years 
the following table sets forth loans charged off and recovered by type of loan and an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the indicated periods

the securities portfolio consists primarily of agency guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented   and of total securities as of december    and  respectively 
based upon the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are a preferable investment vehicle for the banks 
mortgage backed securities offer attractive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
the banks investment strategies during the past three years have been focused on the purchase of seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives years which have been purchased at discounts  at par and at a premium to par 
the banks also diversified their securities holdings in by purchasing other bonds and permissible equities 
historically  management believes these securities are reasonably predictable in terms of price volatility  prepayment speeds and monthly cash flows 
the sharp decrease in long term investment yields  and as a consequence lower mortgage rates  led to a significant increase in prepayment speeds in and as a result  management repositioned the securities portfolio to reduce the overall impact on yields and improve longer term profitability 
all fixed and adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations contain a certain amount of risk related to the uncertainty of prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
interest rate changes have a direct impact upon prepayment rates 
the company uses computer simulation models to test the average life and yield volatility of adjustable rate mortgage pools and collateralized mortgage obligations under various interest rate assumptions to monitor volatility 
stress tests are performed quarterly

capital resources the company monitors compliance with bank and bank holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  tier  or core capital  and total capital  which consists of tier plus tier capital 
see business supervision and regulation bank holding company regulation for definitions of tier and tier capital 
the following tables set forth the company s capital ratios as of the indicated dates 
risk based capital ratios december  amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands tier capital to risk weighted assets    tier capital minimum requirement    total capital to risk weighted assets    total capital minimum requirements    total risk weighted assets    liquidity the company manages its liquidity position with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities 
in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity 
the banks have used the fhlb extensively during  and assuming collateral is available to secure loans  each bank can borrow up to of its assets with the fhlb  which provided the banks with a total additional million in unused capacity at december  the banks also have various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to million of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements and brokered certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was million at december  the banks maintain these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly  and also by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of earnings  was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a significant component in the fluctuation of net cash provided by or used in operating activities is the timing of the proceeds from real estate loans held for sale to permanent investors in and net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of loan and investment funding  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities  consisting principally of deposit growth and net borrowings  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
asset liability management the business of the company and the composition of its balance sheet consists of investments in interest earning assets primarily loans  mortgage backed securities and other securities which are primarily funded by interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each bank s internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each bank s assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each bank and the effects of rate changes on each bank s earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the board of directors 
each bank also maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based upon simulation modeling  these guidelines include a change in net interest income upon an immediate or gradual basis point change in interest rates 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and asset liability management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis and gap analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp  base  bp  bp   net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp   bp  base  bp  bp   as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would decrease the company s net interest income by or approximately million 
overall net interest income sensitivity has increased slightly from to  but remains within company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
this increased sensitivity was due to the changes in interest rates that effected various earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net income by or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would increase the company s net interest income by or approximately million
