should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated  believed  estimated or expected 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere herein 
general the business of the company is primarily the marketing  financing and sale of timeshare interests  retail lots and land parcels  servicing the related receivables  and operating and managing timeshare properties 
pec pec recognizes revenue primarily from sales of timeshare interests and land sales in resort areas  interest income  gain on sale of receivables  financial income from servicing the related receivables and management fees from operating and managing timeshare properties 
pec periodically sells its consumer receivables while generally retaining the servicing rights 
revenue from sales of timeshare interests and land is recognized after the requisite rescission period has expired and at such time as the purchaser has paid at least of the sales price for sales of timeshare interests and of the sales price for land sales 
land sales typically meet these requirements within six to ten months of closing  and sales of timeshare interests typically meet these requirements at the time of sale 
the sales price  less a provision for cancellation  is recorded as revenue and the allocated cost related to such net revenue of the timeshare interest or land parcel is recorded as expense in the period that revenue is recognized 
when revenue related to land sales is recognized  the portion of the sales price attributable to uncompleted required improvements  if any  is deferred 
notes receivable with payment delinquencies of days or more have been considered in determining the allowance for cancellations 
cancellations occur when the note receivable is determined to be uncollectible and the related collateral  if any  has been recovered 
cancellation of a note receivable in the quarter the revenue is recognized is deemed to not represent a sale and is accounted for as a reversal of the revenue with an adjustment to cost of sales 
cancellation of a note receivable subsequent to the quarter the revenue was recognized is charged to the allowance for cancellations 
the company generally sells its notes receivable at par value 
proceeds from the sale of notes receivable sold with recourse were   and for the years ended august   and  respectively 
when the company sells notes receivable  it retains certain participation in the cash flows of the notes receivable sold and generally retains the associated servicing rights 
the sales are generally subject to limited recourse provisions as provided in the respective notes receivable sales agreements 
under these agreements  the company is generally obligated to replace or repurchase accounts that become over days delinquent or are otherwise subject to replacement or repurchase in either cash or receivables 
reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse represents the company s estimate of losses to be incurred in connection with the recourse provisions of the sales agreements and is shown separately as a liability in the company s balance sheet 
gain on sale of receivables depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
to obtain fair values on the retained interests both at the point of the related receivable sale and periodically thereafter  the company generally estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows estimated using management s best estimates of the key assumptions default rates  rates of prepayment  loss reserve rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
the company s retained interests in receivables sold are carried at fair market value as either derivatives or available for sale investments 
unrealized holding gains or losses on the retained interests are included in earnings for those transactions structured so that the company  through its retained interest  receives fixed interest amounts and pays the buyer variable amounts based on a floating interest rate index  as the resulting financial interest meets the definition of a derivative 
unrealized holding gains  if any  on retained interests in notes receivable sold not meeting the definition of a derivative would be included in shareholders equity  net of income taxes 
losses in such retained interests are reflected in earnings 
in september  the company sold to a financial institution million of land receivables at par 
the company recognized a  gain on the sale of the receivables and recorded a  retained interest in notes receivable sold  which is included in other assets  and a  recourse obligation which is included in reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse on the consolidated balance sheet 
in august  the company sold to a financial institution million of timeshare interest receivables at par 
the company recognized a  gain on the sale of the receivables and recorded a  retained interest in notes receivable sold which is included in other assets  and a  recourse obligation which is included in reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse on the consolidated balance sheet 
provision for cancellations relating to notes receivable is recorded as expense in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes receivable 
pec records provision for cancellations at the time revenue is recognized  based on historical experience and current economic factors 
the related allowance for cancellations represents pec s estimate of the amount of the future credit losses to be incurred over the lives of the notes receivable 
the allowance for cancellations is reduced by actual cancellations experienced  including cancellations related to previously sold notes receivable which were reacquired pursuant to the recourse obligations discussed herein 
such allowance is also reduced to establish the separate liability for reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse 
pec s judgment in determining the adequacy of this allowance is based upon a periodic review of its portfolio of notes receivable 
these reviews take into consideration changes in the nature and level of the portfolio  historical cancellation experience  current economic conditions which affect the purchasers ability to pay  changes in collateral values  estimated value of inventory that may be reacquired and overall portfolio quality 
changes in the allowance as a result of such reviews are included in the provision for cancellations 
recourse to pec on sales of notes receivable is governed by the agreements between the purchasers and pec 
the reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse represents pec s estimate of the fair value of future credit losses to be incurred over the lives of the notes receivable 
a liability for reserve for notes receivable sold with recourse is established at the time of each sale based upon pec s estimate of the fair value of the future recourse obligation under each agreement of sale 
fees for servicing notes receivable originated by pec and sold with servicing rights retained are generally based on a stipulated percentage of the outstanding principal balance of such notes receivable and are recognized when earned 
financial income includes changes in the fair value of retained interests sold and interest income accreted on such interests 
interest income represents the interest earned on loans held in pec s portfolio  the accretion of the discount on the retained interests in receivables sold and interest on cash funds 
total costs and expenses consist primarily of marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses  direct costs of sales of timeshare interests and land  depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
marketing and sales costs directly attributable to unrecognized sales are accounted for as deferred selling costs until such time as the sale is recognized 
the company incurs a portion of operating expenses of the timeshare associations based on ownership of unsold timeshare interests at each of the respective timeshare properties 
these costs are referred to as association assessments or maintenance payments  and are included in costs and expenses in the consolidated income statements under the caption of general and administrative 
management fees received from the associations are included in revenues in the consolidated income statements under the caption of other 
these fees are deemed not to be the result of a separate revenue generating line of business since the management activities to which they relate are part of the support of the timeshare business and the fees are actually a reduction of the expense the company incurs to fulfill obligations regarding timeshares 
the following table sets forth certain data regarding notes receivable additions and servicing through sales of timeshare interests and land for the years ended august principal balance of notes receivable additions in thousands   number of notes receivable additions   notes receivable serviced at end of period in thousands   land sales as of august  exclude million of sales not yet recognized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap since the requisite payment amounts have not yet been received or the respective rescission periods have not yet expired 
of the million unrecognized land sales  the company estimates that it will ultimately recognize million of revenues  which would be reduced by a related provision for cancellations of million  estimated selling costs of million and cost of sales of million  for an estimated net profit of million 
real estate risk real estate development involves significant risks  including risks that suitable properties will not be available at reasonable prices  that acquisition  development and construction financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all  that infrastructure and construction costs may exceed original estimates  that construction may not be completed on schedule  and that upon completion of construction and improvements  properties may not be sold on favorable terms or at all 
in addition  pec s timeshare activities  as well as its ownership  improvement  subdivision and sale of land  are subject to comprehensive federal  state and local laws regulating environmental and health matters  protection of endangered species  water supplies  zoning  land development  land use  building design and construction and other matters 
such laws and difficulties in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  the requisite licenses  permits  allocations  authorizations and other entitlements pursuant to such laws can adversely impact the development and completion of pec s projects 
the enactment of slow growth or no growth initiatives in any area where pec sells land or timeshare interests could also delay or preclude entirely the development of such properties

in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
the issue is how to record interest income and to measure impairment on retained and purchased beneficial interests 
the task force concluded that the holder of a beneficial interest should recognize interest income over the life of the investment based on an anticipated yield determined by periodically estimating cash flows 
if the fair value of the beneficial interest has declined below its carrying amount and the decline is other than temporary  an entity should apply impairment of securities guidance similar to sfas fair value method

effects of changing prices and inflation the company s operations are sensitive to increases in interest rates and to inflation 
increased borrowing costs resulting from increases in interest rates may not be immediately recoverable from prospective purchasers 
inflationary increases are difficult to pass on to customers since increases in sales prices often result in lower sales closing rates and higher cancellations 
the company s notes receivable consist primarily of fixed rate long term installment contracts that do not increase or decrease as a result of changes in interest rates charged to the company 
in addition  delinquency and cancellation rates may be affected by changes in the national economy
