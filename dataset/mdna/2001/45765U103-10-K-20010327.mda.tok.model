the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview we commenced operations in as a direct marketer of hard disk drives and other mass storage products 
since then  we have expanded our product line to include name brand computers and a full line of hardware and software products 
net sales include direct marketing sales to businesses  educational institutions  government organizations  consumers and computer resellers  as well as from outsourcing services 
initially  we focused our marketing effort primarily on advertising in computer magazines and the use of inbound toll free telemarketing 
we have shifted our marketing strategy to the use of outbound account executives  complimented by the use of electronic commerce and marketing  focused primarily on the small to medium sized business market 
to that end  we have hired a number of account executives  and plan to continue to actively increase our account executive base by approximately to  net  per quarter through  primarily in canada and the united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter of  we expanded internationally by initiating operations in canada 
during  we entered the united kingdom market in the second quarter and the german market in the fourth quarter  both through acquisitions 
in  we began providing direct marketing services to third party original equipment manufacturers to leverage our infrastructure and increase our net earnings 
presently  our outsourcing arrangements are service fee based whereby the company derives net sales based primarily upon a cost plus arrangement and a percentage of the sales price from products sold 
revenues from service fee based programs and direct costs related to the generation of those revenues are included in the company s net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
also  as an accommodation to select service fee based program clients  we also purchase and immediately resale products to our clients for ultimate client resale to their customers 
these pass through product sales are completed at little or no gross margin and are included in net sales and costs of goods sold 
prior to october   under certain outsourcing arrangements  direct alliance took title to inventories of products and assumed the credit risk associated with sales to the end user 
revenues and the related costs from the sales of such products are included in the company s net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
starting october   all of direct alliance s programs are service fee based programs 
some of the programs may be seasonal in nature  as the manufacturers target customers can have cyclical buying patterns 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products industry is very aggressive and declining 
therefore  to increase sales we seek to expand our customer base  increase our penetration of existing customers  expand into new markets  expand our product offering and expand our outsourcing clients 
the level of sales is also affected by the product mix  the number of lines per order and the mix of type of outsourcing arrangements 
we expect pricing pressures to continue  and we may be required to reduce our prices to remain competitive 
the continued acceptance of electronic commerce might place additional pricing pressure on the company 
such pricing pressures could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
we expect gross margins to continue to decline by approximately one to two tenths of one percent per quarter on average in  and thereafter  primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales costs of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses aborted acquisition proceeds costs restricted stock charge amortization of goodwill 
earnings from operations non operating expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to billion in from billion in insight represented and of total company sales in and  respectively 
direct alliance represented the remaining and of total company sales in and  respectively 
net sales derived from insight  the direct marketing business  increased million  or  to billion in from billion in net sales for insight s united states core organically grown direct business increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in net sales resulted primarily from deeper account penetration  increased market share  an expanded customer base both domestic and international  expanded product offerings and internet enhancements that increased unassisted transactions to of sales for  from of sales for insight s average order size increased to  in from in north america sales represented and of insight s sales in and  respectively  with the remaining sales generated in europe 
sales to businesses  including government and education  increased to of net sales in  up from in insight had  account executives at december  with  in north america and in europe  an increase from   and  respectively  at december  net sales for plusnet  whose numbers are included in insight s numbers  increased million  or  to million in from million in net sales derived from direct alliance  the outsourcing business  increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase resulted from expansion of service fee based programs offset by the shift in the mix of outsourcing arrangements from product based programs to service fee based programs 
as a result of direct alliance s strategic emphasis on service fee based programs as opposed to product based programs  of direct alliance s net sales were from service fee based programs via pass through product sales in compared to via pass through product sales in gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in insight s gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in direct alliance s gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in the fluctuations in gross profit percentage primarily resulted from increased gross profit provided by direct alliance s service fee based programs and insight s decreased product margin amidst pricing strategies and pressures while other components of cost of goods sold  such as supplier reimbursements  freight and discounts  remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
on average  we expect our future gross profit percentage to decrease approximately one to two tenths of one percent per quarter  depending on factors such as industry wide pricing pressures  supplier reimbursement programs  pricing selling strategies and our product and outsourcing mix 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percent of net sales to in from in this decline was attributable to increased economies of scale and the utilization of emerging technologies 
we increased our unassisted web sales to of sales for from of sales for we also increased the percentage of shipments made using our electronic direct ship programs with our suppliers to in from in 
table of contents these enhancements were partially offset by additional costs associated with an increase in the number of account executives  the infrastructure necessary to build up the company s international operations and additional investments in our outsourcing operations 
aborted acquisition proceeds costs 
on october   we announced that we had terminated a proposed european merger 
as a result  the fourth quarter and year end financial results reflect a million  pre tax  charge for acquisition costs incurred by the company 
the year end financial results include million related to proceeds received from an insurance policy covering the costs incurred in the aborted acquisition 
restricted stock charge 
the company has issued shares of restricted common stock as incentives to certain officers and employees 
the restricted common shares are valued at the date of grant  amortized over the three year vesting period and some contain an acceleration clause which causes the shares to automatically vest if the company s stock closed above a certain price of either or per share 
on may   the company s stock closed above causing  restricted common shares to automatically vest 
the company has recorded a pre tax charge of million related to the early vesting of this restricted common stock 
this charge represents the unamortized portion of the restricted stock in excess of the scheduled amortization 
scheduled amortization is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
at december   there were  shares of restricted common stock outstanding  which represents million of unamortized deferred compensation 
 of these restricted common shares will automatically vest if the company s stock closes above per share 
the remaining  shares have no such acceleration clause 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill increased from million in to million in due to the issuance of treasury stock in the amount of million in the second quarter of for the final plusnet acquisition contingent payment 
this payment was based on the profitability of plusnet for the year ended december  and was recorded as an addition to goodwill in non operating expense  net 
non operating income expense  net  which consists primarily of interest expense and interest income  increased to  of income in from  of expense in interest expense primarily relates to borrowings associated with the financing of facility acquisitions and the financing of inventory purchases under the company s line of credit 
interest income is generated by the company through short term investments  some of which are investment grade tax advantaged bonds 
interest income continues to increase because of our increasingly strong cash position 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate was and for the years and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to greater utilization in of foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in sales derived from direct marketing increased million  or  to  million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from deeper account penetration  increased market share  an expanded customer base both domestic and international  expanded product offering  acquisitions of direct marketing companies accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and internet enhancements that increased unassisted transactions to of sales for  from of sales for sales derived from outsourcing arrangements increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase resulted from expansion of existing programs  and the addition of new programs  but the growth rate also reflects a shift in the mix of outsourcing arrangements from product based programs to service fee based programs 
sales from european markets accounted for and of the company s net sales in and  respectively 
this increase resulted primarily from our acquisition in of two foreign based companies  accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased from in to in our gross margin on sales decreased because of industry pricing pressures  a shift in product mix and pricing strategies 
these decreases were partially offset by a significant increase in gross profit dollars from the outsourcing service fee based programs and by the company s ability  as a result of its increased volume and financial position  to take advantage of supplier payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  rebates and purchasing opportunities 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percent of net sales to in from in this decline was attributable to increased economies of scale and the utilization of emerging technologies 
we increased our unassisted web sales to of sales for from of sales for we also increased the percentage of shipments made using our electronic direct ship programs with our suppliers to in from in 
table of contents these enhancements were partially offset by additional costs associated with an increase in the number of account executives  the infrastructure necessary to build up the company s international operations  and higher costs incurred to integrate new acquisitions 
the company has issued shares of restricted stock to certain officers and employees 
these shares vest over three years with the unvested shares being forfeited if the recipient is no longer an employee of the company 
the restricted stock is valued at the date of grant and such amount is amortized over the vesting period 
the majority of these shares contain an acceleration clause which would cause them to automatically vest if the company s stock closes at or above a certain price  ranging from to at december  there were  shares of restricted stock outstanding which represents million of unamortized deferred compensation 
aborted acquisition costs 
on october   we announced that we had terminated a proposed european merger 
therefore  the fourth quarter and year end financial results reflect a million  pre tax  charge for acquisition costs incurred by the company 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill increased from million in to million in due to a full year of amortization relating to acquisitions made in non operating expense  net 
non operating expense  net  which consists primarily of interest expense  net of interest income  decreased to  in from  in interest expense relates primarily to borrowings under the company s line of credit  which have been necessary to finance the company s growth  and interest expense associated with the financing of our facilities in tempe  arizona 
interest expense is offset by interest income generated from short term investments  some of which are investment grade tax advantaged bonds 
overall  interest expense decreased because of our improved cash position 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate was and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due to not being able to recognize certain tax benefits from losses at foreign subsidiaries  and non deductibility of the goodwill in foreign subsidiaries 
seasonality and quarterly results although the company has historically experienced variability in the rates of sales growth  it has not experienced seasonality in its overall business during the past several years as we increased the percentage of our sales from business  education and government units 
some of our outsourcing arrangements may be seasonal in nature because the manufacturers target customers can have cyclical buying patterns  but the impact on overall sales in negligible

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs are to fund the working capital requirements and capital expenditures necessitated by our sales growth 
capital expenditures for and were million and million  respectively  primarily for facility acquisitions in the united states and canada and continued upgrade of the company s equipment  systems and software 
the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million for as compared to million for the positive cash flow in the current year was primarily generated by million in net earnings and a million increase in accounts payable 
these funds were used to fund a million increase in accounts receivables and a million increase in inventories 
at the year end  we had a million credit facility with a finance company 
as of december   we had a long term outstanding balance of million  and million was available under the line of credit 
the agreement provides for cash advances outstanding at any one time up to a maximum of million on the line of credit  subject to limitations based upon the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
cash advances bear interest at libor plus 
the credit facility can be used for the purchases of inventories from certain suppliers with that portion being classified on the balance sheet as accounts payable 
at december   million of the facility was used to facilitate the purchase of inventories 
the credit facility expires in february the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the line of credit contains various covenants including the requirement that the company maintain a specified amount of tangible net worth as well as restrictions on the payment of cash dividends 
our future capital requirements include financing the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventories  and the purchase of software enhancements  equipment  furniture and fixtures and other facilities to accomplish future growth 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations together with the funds available under our credit facility will be adequate to support the company s presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements through our ability to continue funding our planned growth beyond is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on the company s operations 
new accounting standards during december  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
summarizes the sec staff s view in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
in march  the sec staff issued sab no 
a to delay certain transition provisions of sab no 
sab no 
a deferred the effective date for registrants with a fiscal year beginning between december  and march  those registrants may report a change in accounting principle no later than their second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year beginning after december  in periods subsequent to transition  registrants should disclose the amount of revenue if material to income before income taxes recognized in those periods that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment 
we have adopted the provisions of sab no 
and the adoption did not have a material impact on our sales or revenue recognition policies 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
the interpretation clarifies the application of apb opinion no 
in certain situations  as defined 
the interpretation was effective july  but covers certain events having occurred after december  to the extent that events covered by this interpretation occur during the period after december  but before the issuance of the interpretation  the effects of applying this interpretation would be recognized on a prospective basis from the effective date 
accordingly  upon initial application of this interpretation  no adjustment would be made to the financial statements for the periods before the effective date and no expense would be recognized for any additional compensation cost measured that is attributable to periods before the effective date 
we have adopted this interpretation and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which established accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
this new standard  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
 will be effective for the year ending december  it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting standards not yet adopted by the company there are no new applicable accounting standards that we have not adopted 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future results and financial condition are dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market  sell and distribute computers  hardware and software and to provide direct marketing outsourcing services 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
fluctuations in operating results 
our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the condition of the computer and related products industry  shifts in demand for or availability of computer and related products and industry announcements of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
sales can be dependent on specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
our operating results are also highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales which fluctuates due to numerous factors including opportunities to increase market share  the availability of opportunistic purchases  changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  general competitive conditions and the relative mix of products sold during the period 
we noted unusual competitive pressure and a general lightening in business demand in the notebook and desktop product categories during the last half of december that has continued on into we expect gross margins to continue to decline by approximately one to two tenths of one percent per quarter on average in primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 
in addition  our expense levels  including the costs and salaries in connection with the hiring of account executives  are based  in part  on anticipated sales 
therefore  we may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
as a result  quarterly period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
highly competitive industry 
the computer and related products industry is highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on product availability  price  speed of delivery  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs and quality and breadth of product lines 
we expect competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry and as the industry s rate of growth in north america and europe slows 
the company competes with a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of computers and related products  including traditional computer and related products retailers  computer superstores  internet only computer providers  consumer electronics and office supply superstores  mass merchandisers and national direct marketers including value added resellers and specialty retailers  aggregators  distributors  franchisers  manufacturers and national computer retailers  some of which have commenced their own direct marketing operations 
certain of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the computer and related products industry is undergoing significant change 
we believe that consumers have become more accepting of large volume  cost effective channels of distribution such as national direct marketers  internet only computer providers  computer superstores  consumer electronic and office supply superstores  and mass merchandisers 
major computer original equipment manufacturers have begun to sell their products directly to end users 
additionally  product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the industry and we expect pricing pressures to continue 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of our market share  reduced sales and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect gross margins to continue to decline by approximately one to two tenths of one percent per quarter on average in primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 

table of contents possible nonrenewal or cancellation of outsourcing arrangements  expansion of services to non computer customers 
we perform direct marketing outsourcing services for certain manufacturers in the computer industry pursuant to various arrangements 
these parties may cancel such arrangements on relatively short notice or fail to renew them upon expiration 
there is no assurance that we will be able to replace any manufacturers that terminate or fail to renew their relationships with us 
additionally  we seek to expand our offerings outside of the computer industry 
the failure to maintain current arrangements or the inability to enter into new ones within or outside the computer industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with past and future acquisitions  international operations 
we may seek to acquire additional businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
there is no assurance that we will identify acquisition candidates that would result in successful combinations or that any such acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms 
any future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  all of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we initiated an operation in canada in and completed acquisitions in europe in as part of our effort to penetrate international markets 
in implementing this strategy  we face barriers to entry and the risk of competition from local and other companies that already have established global businesses as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because we may continue to develop our international business through acquisitions  we may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in increasing our international business  if at all  in a profitable manner 
business interruption  reliance on information systems 
we believe that our success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to customers 
in addition  our success is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by our information systems  which affect our ability to manage our sales  distribution  inventory and accounting systems 
we began in a major information system upgrade to replace our core business function software applications to accommodate our expanding business needs which will continue in and beyond 
although we have redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in the information system or in our telephone communication systems would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
managing rapid growth  no assurance of additional financing 
since our inception  we have experienced substantial changes in and expansion of our business and operations 
our past expansion has placed  and any future expansion would place  significant demands on our administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
our operating expenses and staffing levels have increased and are expected to increase substantially in the future 
in particular  we have hired a significant number of additional personnel  including senior sales managers  account executives and other persons with experience in both the computer and direct marketing industries  and there can be no assurance that such persons will perform to our expectations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract  assimilate and retain qualified persons in the future 
in addition  we expect that any future expansion will continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees 
we also expect over time to expend considerable resources to expand convert our information system and to implement a variety of new systems and procedures 
if our sales do not increase in proportion to our operating expenses  our information systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  or we fail to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel or otherwise fail to manage our expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve our growth strategy 
until recent years  cash flow from operations has been insufficient to finance our growth  and we have relied upon a line of credit and proceeds from public offerings to finance working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow or that adequate financing or additional public funds will be available to finance continued growth 
changing methods of distribution 
the manner in which computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as on line shopping services via the internet  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 

table of contents from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance on suppliers  allocation of goods 
we acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors 
purchases from ingram micro  inc and tech data corporation  both distributors of computers and related products  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of aggregate purchases for no other supplier accounted for more than of purchases in however  the top five suppliers as a group accounted for approximately of our product purchases during the loss of ingram micro  inc or any other supplier could cause a short term disruption in the availability of products 
additionally  there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to sell directly to end users  they will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to companies such as insight 
certain of the products offered from time to time by us are subject to manufacturer allocation  which limits the number of units of such products available to resellers like us 
our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products  in particular  high demand products such as desktops and notebooks  or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way which favors one of our competitors relative to us could cause us to be unable to fill customers orders in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain suppliers provide us with substantial incentives in the form of payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  price protections and rebates 
supplier funds are used to offset  among other things  cost of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
we compete with other market competitors for these funds 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to receive such incentives or that we will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner or at all 
a reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
rapid changes in product standards and risk of inventory obsolescence 
the computer and related products industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
in addition  in order to satisfy customer demand  protect ourselves against product shortages and to obtain greater purchasing discounts  we may carry increased inventory levels of certain products in the future 
we can have limited or no return privileges with respect to certain of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence 
dependence on key personnel 
our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
further  we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives 
our inability to retain such personnel or to train them rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
state sales or use tax collection 
we presently collect sales tax only in states in which we have a physical presence 
these states include arizona  indiana and tennessee 
although not required  we also collect sales tax in california as an accommodation to our customers 
various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales or use taxes on the sales of products shipped to that state s residents 
the united states supreme court has affirmed its position that  under the commerce clause of the united states constitution  a state cannot constitutionally impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier from a point outside of the state 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on us in states to which we ship products would result in additional administrative expenses and could result in price increases to the customer or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
from time to time  legislation to overturn this decision of the supreme court has been introduced  although to date no such legislation has been passed 
additionally  there is the possibility of a tax being imposed on sales transacted via the internet although today none has been enacted 
we also collect a goods and services tax in canada  and a value added tax in the united kingdom and germany 
risk of increasing marketing  postage and shipping costs
