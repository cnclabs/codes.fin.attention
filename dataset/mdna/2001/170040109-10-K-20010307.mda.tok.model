factors that may affect future results as a biotechnology company  chiron is engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this report and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by the company from time to time reflect management s current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  which could cause actual results to differ 
promising technologies ultimately may not prove successful the company focuses its research and development activities on areas in which it has particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of such programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it does not have the intended therapeutic or prophylactic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
regulatory approvals the company is required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of its products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis  and  in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
see part i  item business government regulation above 
product candidates that appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
manufacturing most of the company s products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process that is  to show that the process works and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products that may result in lot failures 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products that require novel manufacturing processes 
accordingly  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval  which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
specific to the company s new product  tobi registered trademark tobramycin solution for inhalation  the company relies on others to supply raw materials and to manufacture tobi registered trademark according to regulatory requirements 
although chiron believes either one of its two suppliers of bulk powdered tobramycin will be able to supply sufficient quantities to meet its current needs  chiron has not entered into long term supply contracts with the suppliers 
rather  the company has an agreement for the formulation and packaging of tobi registered trademark for a minimum term of years 
there can be no assurance that chiron will be able to obtain future supplies of bulk tobramycin on favorable terms  that contract manufacturers will be able to provide sufficient quantities of tobi registered trademark or that the products supplied will meet specifications 
patents held by third parties may delay or prevent commercialization third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the us and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain of the company s products and products in development 
it is likely that third parties will obtain other such patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be sufficiently broad to prevent or delay chiron from manufacturing or marketing products important to the company s current and future business 
the scope  validity and enforceability of such patents  if granted  the extent to which chiron may wish or need to obtain licenses to such patents  and the cost and availability of such licenses cannot be accurately predicted 
if chiron does not obtain such licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around such patents 
alternatively  chiron could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
chiron could also incur substantial costs in challenging the validity and scope of such patents 
product acceptance the company may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
there can be no assurance that healthcare providers and patients will accept such products 
in addition  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect the usage of the company s products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of the company s product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over the company s product 
competition chiron operates in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  as well as biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than the company 
accordingly  even if the company is successful in launching a product  it may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  or the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages 
the technologies applied by the company and its competitors are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
chiron s patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues chiron seeks to obtain patents on its inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use the company s inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by chiron and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate chiron for the use of the invention 
there can be no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to chiron will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets 
it is not known how many of the company s pending patent applications will be granted  or the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the us and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is neither conclusive as to its validity nor the enforceable scope of its claims 
the company has engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of its patents and expects to continue to do so in the future 
even if the company is successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to resolve patent litigation successfully may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by the patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements and most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
availability of reimbursement  government and other pressures on pricing in the us and other significant markets  sales of the company s products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products  and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the us at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
the growth of managed care in the us also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
costs associated with expanding the business management expects to grow the business in areas in which the company can be most competitive  either through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
in connection with these efforts  the company may incur significant charges  costs and expenses which could impact the company s profitability  including impairment losses  restructuring charges  the write off of purchased in process technologies  transaction related expenses  costs associated with integrating new businesses and the cost of amortizing goodwill and other intangibles 
other new products and sources of revenue many products in the company s current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
the company s ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on its ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of the company s technologies  and on its ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such other sources of revenue will be established 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in  the company sold certain businesses for cash  including its in vitro diagnostics and ophthalmics businesses  and as a result has significant cash balances and short term investments 
the company s financial results  therefore  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in the us in addition  the company sells products in many countries throughout the world  and its financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
collaboration partners an important part of the company s business strategy depends upon collaborations with third parties  including research collaborations and joint efforts to develop and commercialize new products 
as circumstances change  the company and its corporate partners may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
the company may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  the parties may differ in their views as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the corporate partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact the company s profitability 
stock price volatility the price of the company s stock  like that of other biotechnology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
any number of events  both internal and external to the company  may affect the stock price 
these include  without limitation  results of clinical trials conducted by the company or by its competitors  announcements by the company or its competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by the company against third parties to enforce its patents and claims filed by third parties against the company relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners  corporate restructuring by the company  licensing activities by the company  and the acquisition or sale by the company of products  products in development or businesses 
in connection with its research and development collaborations  from time to time the company invests in equity securities of its corporate partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events that affect the company s stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact the company s profitability 
income taxes the company is taxable principally in the us  germany  italy and the netherlands 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws  which could increase the company s tax provision in the future 
the company has negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes that are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while the company believes that all material tax liabilities are reflected properly in its balance sheet  the company is presently under audit in several jurisdictions  and there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with the company s interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  the company has assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of its former subsidiaries  chiron vision subject to certain limitations and chiron diagnostics 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact the company s entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering its effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries exposing the company to the effects of changes in foreign currency rates 
the company s primary exposure to foreign exchange rates is associated with the value of the euro 
an increase in the value of the us dollar vis a vis the euro will result in a lower value of the company s non us dollar based revenues 
to manage foreign currency exchange risks  chiron enters into forward foreign currency contracts forwards and cross currency interest rate swaps swaps and purchases foreign currency option contracts options 
chiron does not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional principal amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the company uses forwards to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies transaction exposures 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
chiron s objective is to minimize the transaction gains and losses recorded in current earnings that result from remeasuring foreign denominated assets and liabilities based on exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s transaction exposures are primarily denominated in major european currencies 
at december   these exposures amounted to million and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the forwards was million fair value of million as of december  based on exposures as of december   a adverse movement against the company s portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus the company s portfolio of transaction exposures has not occurred in the last quarters 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were million in but were not significant in or in  the company hedged a portion of its exposure to the british pound related to menjugate tm sales 
the company settled this forward contract upon substantial conclusion of menjugate tm sales in the united kingdom in the second quarter the settlement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
chiron may selectively hedge anticipated currency exposures by purchasing quarterly put options 
the company s primary anticipated exposures are related to foreign revenues received from selling products in the major european countries 
to limit hedging costs  the company generally purchases out of the money put options 
the company had no option contracts outstanding at december  and the company had entered into a series of swaps to modify the interest and or currency characteristics of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
the objective of the swaps entered into by the company was to fix the interest and currency rate exposures associated with the company s wholly owned german subsidiary 
the exposures were denominated in deutsche marks 
the company terminated these swaps in the fourth quarter  which resulted in a gain of approximately million recorded as a component of other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the notional principal amount of the company s swaps at december  was million 
based on the company s exposure at december   if the deutsche mark had strengthened or weakened by during  the value of the underlying hedged exposure would have increased or decreased by million and million  respectively 
a movement in the value of the deutsche mark versus the us dollar has occurred in of the last years 
currency fluctuations in the value of the german subsidiary s assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the value of related swaps  were reflected as a component of other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates in both its investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments with interest rates tied to libor 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s long term debt because the company s long term debt bore interest at fixed rates 
in addition  all long term debt was substantially converted to the company s common stock during chiron s investment portfolio amounted to approximately million at december  as of that date  the company also had million of floating rate obligations tied to libor 
the company has a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of its portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to libor 
the analysis below focuses on the impact of changes in interest rates to chiron and is based on a net portfolio balance of million 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to chiron over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income over the month period  partially offset by an immediate decline in the market value of securities held 
the net impact of this scenario is an estimated increase in reported income of million over the month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in reported income of million 
the impact on reported earnings will be greater given that unrealized changes in the value of the portfolio are reported in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
chiron currently does not hedge these exposures 
the effect of these changes in interest rates on the company s portfolio  as measured over a month period  are mitigated by the relatively short duration of chiron s portfolio 
a basis point movement in the federal funds rate has occurred in of the last years  a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years  and a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years 
equity securities risk the company has exposure to equity price risk because of its investments in equity securities 
typically  the company obtains these securities through its collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
a majority of these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
the company periodically reviews the carrying values of these securities  and other than temporary losses are recognized against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
changes in share prices or in the volatility of share prices affect the value of chiron s equity portfolio 
to reduce this risk  the company has hedged a portion of its exposure through short sales and forward sales contracts 
the short sales and forward sales contracts substantially offset the long position and  in effect  neutralize the impact of market valuation shifts on the hedged securities 
in  the company settled the short sales upon sale of the related equity securities 
the settlement resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the notional principal amount of the company s short sales at december  was million fair value of million 
the notional principal amount of the company s forward sales contracts on its equity securities at december  was million fair value of million 
the company had no forward sales contracts on its equity securities during in the future  the company may use additional hedging strategies in order to mitigate the potential adverse impact from changes in the market value of stock prices 
there can be no assurance that other than temporary losses will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company recorded no charges in  and recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively  to write down certain available for sale equity securities for which the decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary 
as of december   if the market price of chiron s equity investments  including warrants and preferred stock  decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk chiron manages the risk of counterparty default on its derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
all derivative financial instruments are executed with financial institutions with strong credit ratings  which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment 
chiron has not experienced any losses due to counterparty default
