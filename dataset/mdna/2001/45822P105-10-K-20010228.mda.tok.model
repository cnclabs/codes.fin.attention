item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations wps resources corporation wps resources corporation is a holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wisconsin public service corporation and upper peninsula power company 
another wholly owned subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  is a holding company for our nonregulated businesses including wps energy services  inc and wps power development  inc compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following chart wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues net income basic and diluted earnings per share the substantial revenue growth was largely due to increased gas and electric sales at wps energy services and increased sales at wps power development as we acquire additional customers and expand into new markets 
part of the increase in revenues was a result of the record high unit cost of natural gas experienced in gas cost per therm was higher in than in the high unit cost of gas is reflected in both revenues and cost of sales  thus having little impact on margin 
the increase in net income and earnings per share was the result of higher electric and gas utility margins and increases in wps energy services electric and gas margins 
additionally  a higher margin on operating activities along with additional tax credits received at wps power development contributed to higher income 
partially offsetting these factors were increases in operating and interest expenses  coupled with costs associated with an electric energy contract entered into by wps resources as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes 
overview of utility operations utility operations include the electric utility operations at wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power  and the gas utility operations at wisconsin public service 
net income from electric utility operations was million in compared with million in net income from gas utility operations was million in and million in the primary reasons for higher utility net income were a wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was colder in than in electric utility operations the consolidated electric utility margin represents electric revenue less cost of sales exclusive of intercompany transactions 
our consolidated electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service which became effective on january  this rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year 
the electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under other electric and gas utility expenses income 
electric utility results thousands revenues fuel and purchased power margin sales in kilowatt hours although our consolidated kilowatt hour sales were only slightly up  partially due to a cooler summer in than in  consolidated revenues increased due to the wisconsin retail electric rate increase at wisconsin public service 
our consolidated fuel expense increased million  or  due to increased production at wisconsin public service s fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants 
in addition  the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas 
generation costs at the kewaunee nuclear power plant decreased in due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of a similar outage did not occur in the kewaunee plant was off line beginning april  and returned to power on june  during the scheduled outage  nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power 
wisconsin public service is the operator and owner of the kewaunee plant 
our consolidated purchased power expense decreased million  however  largely due to a decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service the opportunity to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
annual fuel costs were within this window and  accordingly  no adjustment was initiated 
gas utility operations the consolidated gas utility margin represents gas revenues less purchases exclusive of intercompany transactions 
the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million  or  in due to an increase in therm sales 
gas utility results thousands revenues purchase costs margin sales in therms winter weather was a factor for wisconsin public service s gas operations in weather was colder in than in  however  weather was warmer than normal in wisconsin public service s gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of a increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a increase in overall therm sales 
wisconsin public service s gas purchase costs increased million  or 
this increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 
the higher unit cost of natural gas is reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
under current regulatory practice  the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission allow wisconsin public service to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause 
other electric and gas utility expenses income utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million 
electric utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the kewaunee plant 
higher earnings of million on the kewaunee plant s nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income at wisconsin public service in due to regulatory practices  this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense 
other income at wisconsin public service also included a gain of million on the sale of a combustion turbine which wisconsin public service constructed for another wisconsin utility 
the public service commission of wisconsin considered this gain in the wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective january  overview of nonutility and nonregulated operations nonutility operations refer to the activities of wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power which do not fall under utility regulation 
nonregulated operations consist of the gas  electric  and other sales at wps energy services  a diversified energy supply and services company and the operations of wps power development  an electric generation asset development company 
nonregulated operations also include those of wps resources and wps resources capital as holding companies and other nonregulated companies 
wps energy services net income improved to million in compared with a loss of million in income at wps power development also improved 
wps power development s net income was million in compared with a loss of million in other nonutility and nonregulated operations experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in the increased loss was primarily due to additional interest expense  increased operating expenses  and a cost of million for an electric energy contract entered into by wps resources in as a hedge against potential summer energy price spikes 
overview of wps energy services wps energy services principal business involves nonregulated gas sales 
revenues at wps energy services grew to million in compared with million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of additional gas and electric sales volumes coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas 
the higher unit cost of gas is also reflected in cost of sales  thus having little impact on margin 
income increased million in due to a larger increase in electric and gas margins than in the related other operating expenses 
wps energy services margins the consolidated nonregulated gas margin represents nonregulated gas revenues less nonregulated gas cost of sales exclusive of intercompany transactions 
the nonregulated gas margin at wps energy services increased million largely due to increased sales volumes 
wps energy services gas results thousands nonregulated gas revenues nonregulated gas cost of sales margin gas revenues at wps energy services more than tripled in compared with this increase was due to sales volumes that doubled as the result of additional sales in the wholesale market and general business growth 
in addition  a large portion of the increase was due to a higher unit cost of natural gas in wps energy services gas cost of sales tripled due to additional gas purchases coupled with a higher unit cost of natural gas 
electric margins at wps energy services increased million in electric revenues at wps energy services were million in and million in this increase in revenue resulted from additional electric sales in pennsylvania and maine associated with the wps power development assets that were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of electric purchases increased million due to additional sales volumes 
wps energy services other expenses other operating expenses at wps energy services increased million  or  primarily due to greater payroll and other operational costs associated with business expansion 
overview of wps power development income at wps power development was million in compared with a loss of million in the increase in income was primarily due to a higher margin on operating activities and additional tax credits 
partially offsetting these factors were higher operating and interest expenses 
tax credits at wps power development increased approximately million in a portion of these tax credits  subject to the limitations of the alternative minimum tax provisions  were used to reduce our current income tax liability 
approximately million of these tax credits have been carried forward to reduce our tax liability in future years 
a large portion of the tax credits at wps power development relate to the operations of the eco synthetic fuel operation 
production at eco was higher than anticipated in despite the physical relocation of the project from alabama to kentucky during eco was taken out of operation in april to prepare for relocation  and wps power development began operation of the facilities in the new location on september  in order to receive optimum benefits from this project  wps power development intends to sell part of its interest in eco this action has been slowed due to issues currently being raised by the internal revenue service with respect to synthetic fuel projects in general 
the current plans call for a closer match of the facility s production level with our ability to use the tax credits that are available for the current year until a sale of a portion of the project is finalized 
in addition  wps power development reversed million of previously recorded losses in the first quarter of as a result of an equity contribution to the eco synthetic fuel project by the minority owner 
prior to this transaction  wps power development had been recording of the operating losses of this project because the minority owner s equity had been reduced to zero  however  it was only allocated of the tax credits 
through an agreement with the minority owner  wps power development is receiving of the tax credits and operating results from the project until the minority owner is able to contribute further capital to fund its share of the operating costs 
wps power development s margin on operating activities and other expenses wps power development experienced an increase of million in its margin on operating activities in this increase was largely due to the operation of the electric generation facilities acquired in maine and canada in the second quarter of and those in pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of other operating expenses at wps power development increased million in due to maintenance and higher production costs at its generation plants in pennsylvania 
costs associated with the investigation and start up of new projects at wps power development also increased in higher interest expense of million in was largely due to nonrecourse debt put in place to finance the plant acquisitions 
additional costs at the sunbury generation plant in pennsylvania lowered results at wps power development  particularly in the fourth quarter of this included higher production costs  higher maintenance costs both planned and accelerated and increased costs of replacement power while the plant was undergoing maintenance 
the decision was made to move some maintenance scheduled in future years into to coincide with other plant downtime 
the accelerated maintenance at the sunbury plant should enhance availability in and future years 
compared with wps resources corporation overview wps resources and results of operations are shown in the following chart wps resources results millions  except share amounts change consolidated operating revenues net income basic and diluted earnings per share the primary reasons for the higher earnings were increased sales volumes at wisconsin public service coupled with the implementation of new wisconsin retail electric and gas rates and the elimination of net trading losses at wps energy services 
overview of utility operations net income from electric utility operations was million in and million in net income from gas utility operations was million in and million in the primary reasons for higher utility net income were increased sales volumes coupled with the implementation of new wisconsin retail electric and gas rates 
electric utility operations our consolidated electric utility margin increased million 
this increase was due to increased sales volumes at wisconsin public service coupled with the january  implementation of new wisconsin retail electric rates 
the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in electric rates 
our consolidated electric utility revenues increased million primarily due to the electric rate increase at wisconsin public service 
a increase in overall kilowatt hour sales at wisconsin public service also contributed to higher electric revenues 
included in electric revenues  but not in electric revenues  were surcharge revenues at wisconsin public service of million related to the recovery of the deferred costs for the kewaunee plant s steam generator repairs 
our consolidated fuel expense increased million as a result of increased generation requirements at wisconsin public service s combustion turbine and nuclear generation plants in partially offsetting this factor was a decrease in production at wisconsin public service s coal fired generation plants as a result of both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities 
our consolidated purchased power requirements increased million primarily due to additional purchase requirements at both wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power in purchase requirements increased at wisconsin public service due to the lack of production at its coal fired generation plants during the time they were off line for maintenance in in addition  the cost of purchases was higher in than in annual fuel costs at december  were within the fuel window authorized by the public service commission of wisconsin and  accordingly  no adjustment was made to electric rates for fuel costs 
gas utility operations the consolidated gas utility margin represents gas revenues less purchases exclusive of intercompany transactions 
the gas utility margin at wisconsin public service increased million in this increase was primarily due to the implementation of a public service commission of wisconsin rate order which authorized a increase in wisconsin retail gas rates and to an increase in therm sales 
wisconsin public service s gas operating revenues increased million 
this increase was due to the implementation of new wisconsin retail gas rates and a increase in overall therm sales as a result of colder weather in although the winter weather was colder in than in  it was still warmer than normal 
gas utility revenues in were reduced by million for refunds from anr pipeline company which were passed on to wisconsin public service s customers 
gas purchase costs in were likewise reduced as this million refund was credited to gas expense 
wisconsin public service s gas purchase costs increased million due to increased sales and to a higher unit cost of natural gas 
other electric and gas utility expenses income other utility operating expenses at wisconsin public service increased million primarily due to higher customer service expenses of million related to conservation expenditures  and higher pension costs of million due to a change in the assumptions used to calculate this expense 
also contributing to increased operating expenses were higher medical benefit expenses of million and higher electric distribution expenses of million 
maintenance expense at wisconsin public service increased million primarily due to additional costs of million at its coal fired generation plants and million at its other power generation plants for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities 
offsetting these costs was a decrease in maintenance expense of million at the kewaunee plant 
a scheduled refueling outage at the kewaunee plant in caused nuclear maintenance expenses to be higher 
in addition  million in deferred costs for the kewaunee plant s steam generator repairs were recognized in maintenance of overhead distribution lines increased million in due to additional tree trimming  line clearance  and storm damage repairs 
overview of nonutility and nonregulated operations wps energy services experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in losses at wps power development were million in and million in although margins on nonregulated energy sales continued to grow  losses were experienced due to operating expenses associated with new facilities  market expansion  and the pursuit of additional projects 
nonutility operations in included a one time special dividend of million 
this special dividend was related to a land sale from an investment held at wisconsin public service 
nonregulated earnings in included a one time dividend of million received by wps resources from a venture capital investment 
overview of wps energy services  inc revenues at wps energy services were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
the revenue decrease was attributable to a combination of lower overall natural gas prices experienced in  and a deliberate change in the wholesale product mix 
wps energy services experienced an improvement in operating results  reducing net losses by in the primary reason for the decrease in losses was the elimination of trading losses that occurred in wps energy services implemented a deliberate shift in focus within its trading unit to emphasize capturing present opportunities in the market rather than taking a position in anticipation of a future market movement 
while not without risk  this lower risk approach did yield gains in wps energy services also experienced an increase in total gas margin due to improved gas procurement operations and processes  and an increased emphasis on creation of wholesale products providing greater value  thus higher margin  to customers in the wholesale marketplace 
partially offsetting these factors was a one time pretax write down of million related to an investment in a gas production field 
wps energy services margins gas margins at wps energy services increased million in gas revenues decreased million and gas cost of sales decreased million as the result of lower overall natural gas market prices and an increased emphasis on higher quality and lower risk wholesale products rather than a large volume of wholesale transactions with lower margins 
improvements in gas procurement processes also contributed to lower cost of sales 
electric margins remained fairly stable 
electric revenues decreased million as the result of wps energy services efforts to focus participation in the wholesale electric markets where transactions were based on physical generation assets controlled by an affiliate of wps resources 
wps energy services other expenses other operating expenses at wps energy services increased million primarily due to costs of million associated with entering into expanded retail customer choice programs 
improved processes and strategies emphasizing reduced risk at wps energy services resulted in a gas trading gain in compared with gas trading losses of million in essentially no electric trading losses were experienced in compared with a million loss in overview of wps power development the increase in losses in at wps power development was primarily due to additional costs incurred for the development and operation of newly acquired facilities and the evaluation of new projects 
wps power development experienced an increase of million in its margin on operating generation facilities in this increase was due to the operation of the electric generation assets acquired in maine and canada on june   and in pennsylvania on november  other operating expenses at wps power development increased million largely due to operating expenses related to the electric generation assets acquired during higher operating expenses at the eco synthetic fuel operation also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting increased expenses at eco was the benefit of tax credits received for these operations 
although eco experienced problems with materials and customers in the early part of  these problems were resolved and sales increased significantly 
additional costs related to the pursuit and development of new projects also contributed to higher operating expenses at wps power development in overview of other nonutility and nonregulated operations a one time dividend of million was received by wisconsin public service in related to a land sale from an investment 
this dividend represented a one cent per share increase to earnings for a one time dividend of million was received by wps resources in from a venture capital investment 
this dividend represented a four cents per share increase in earnings for balance sheet wps resources corporation compared with as the result of wps energy services marking to market its energy contracts and gas in storage in  our balance sheet grew by approximately million 
the mark to market accounting is reflected in both assets and liabilities from risk management activities and the gas in storage inventory account 
customer and other receivables increased million as the result of additional sales volumes at both wps energy services and wisconsin public service 
the higher unit cost of natural gas experienced  especially in december of  also contributed to the increased receivables balance 
likewise  accounts payable increased million largely due to the additional sales volumes and the higher unit cost of natural gas 
long term debt increased million as the result of wps power development obtaining nonrecourse financing related to the sunbury generation plant in the second quarter of commercial paper increased million largely to finance capital needs 
financial condition wps resources corporation investments and financing special common stock dividends of million were paid by wisconsin public service to wps resources in equity infusions of million were made by wps resources to wisconsin public service in the special dividends and equity infusions allowed wisconsin public service s average equity capitalization and its capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established by the public service commission of wisconsin in its rate order 
cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds by million in short term borrowings through commercial paper increased million 
long term debt increased million mainly due to the issuance of million of nonrecourse debt related to the sunbury generation plant 
the sunbury plant was originally financed with short term debt 
our pretax interest coverage  including nonrecourse debt  was times for the months ended december  see the table below for wps resources credit ratings 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wps resources corporation senior unsecured debt aa aa commercial paper a p trust preferred securities a aa wisconsin public service corporation bonds aa aa preferred stock aa aa commercial paper a p we normally use internally generated funds and short term borrowing to satisfy most of our capital requirements 
we seek nonrecourse debt for funding nonregulated acquisitions 
we may periodically issue additional long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt  maintain desired capitalization ratios  and fund future growth 
the specific forms of financing  amounts  and timing will depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
in october  we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission which allowed the issuance of million in the aggregate of public long term debt and common stock 
long term debt of million has been issued under the shelf registration 
wisconsin public service has a shelf registration which provides million of remaining debt financing capacity 
during  we repurchased million of common stock for our stock option plan and other corporate purposes including our employee stock ownership plan 
effective january  we began issuing new shares of common stock for our stock investment plan and for some of our stock based employee benefit plans 
wisconsin public service makes large investments in capital assets 
construction expenditures for wisconsin public service are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
this includes expenditures for replacement of the kewaunee plant s steam generators 
in addition  other capital requirements for wisconsin public service for the three year period include contributions of approximately million to the kewaunee plant s decommissioning trust fund 
upper peninsula power is expected to incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements and repairs at hydro facilities 
in april  sunbury generation  llc  a subsidiary of wps power development  obtained million of nonrecourse financing which is secured by the sunbury generation plant

electric reliability wps resources purchased a megawatt fixed price physical electric energy contract for the months of june  july  and august of the contract allowed for the purchase of electricity at a fixed price  and the sale of that electricity at a floating or market based price shortly before delivery 
the contract was intended for earnings protection against summer energy price spikes in the event of a loss of generation units 
the summer of was extremely mild  and we did not experience any of the anticipated energy price spikes 
as a result  wps resources incurred a cost of million under the electric energy contract 
regulatory on december   wisconsin public service received an order from the public service commission of wisconsin authorizing a increase in retail electric rates and a increase in retail gas rates for and a return on equity was approved 
the new rates were implemented on january  the public service commission of wisconsin did not approve a rate reopener but acknowledged that pursuant to statutes  wisconsin public service may request a reopener at any time 
on october   upper peninsula power filed a million rate increase with the michigan public service commission 
a final rate order should be issued in upper peninsula power has not experienced a rate increase since merger with wisconsin fuel and light company on july   we signed a merger agreement with wisconsin fuel and light company 
under the agreement  wisconsin fuel and light shareholders will receive shares of wps resources common stock for each share of wisconsin fuel and light s common stock 
the exchange ratio will be adjusted if  at the time of closing the transaction  the market price of wps resources common stock exceeds per share or is less than per share 
the market price is defined as the average of the closing price of wps resources common stock during the ten trading days ending three days immediately preceding the effective date of the merger 
the merger remains subject to i approval by the public service commission of wisconsin  ii receipt of an opinion of counsel that the exchange of stock qualifies as a tax free transaction  and iii the satisfaction of various other conditions 
a majority of the outstanding preferred shareholders of wisconsin public service approved the merger  allowing wisconsin fuel and light to merge into wisconsin public service 
a majority of the wisconsin fuel and light shareholders approved the merger in november of the merger will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is expected to be completed in april of acquisition of generation facilities sunbury holdings  llc  a subsidiary of wps power development  purchased cincap vi  llc on september  cincap vi is the owner of the megawatt westwood generation facility located in pennsylvania 
as of january   cincap vi  llc changed its name to wps westwood generation  llc 
on october   sierra pacific power company agreed to sell its tracy pinon power station located near reno  nevada to wps power development 
the megawatt facility consists of several natural gas and oil fired generation units and includes a coal gasification project that had been co funded by the united states department of energy 
the arrangement includes a temporary purchase power agreement to sell the power generated by tracy pinon to sierra pacific 
the purchase price of million is subject to taxes and other adjustments at closing 
closing is expected to occur sometime in we expect to finance a portion of this purchase with non recourse debt 
wps power development reached an agreement to build and operate a megawatt electric cogeneration facility in combined locks  wisconsin 
the facility will provide electricity to wholesale customers through wps energy services 
construction of the facility is expected to begin in the second quarter of with completion by the end of trends wps resources corporation regulatory standards wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and their financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating each utility 
for wisconsin public service these include the public service commission of wisconsin  of revenues  the michigan public service commission  of revenues  and the federal energy regulatory commission  of revenues 
in addition  the kewaunee plant is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
impact of new accounting standard we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  this statement requires derivative instruments to be recorded at their fair value as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the derivative s fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we concluded that the majority of contracts at our utility subsidiaries and at wps power development for the purchase  sale  and storage of natural gas  electricity  coal  and nuclear fuel do not meet the definition of a derivative as defined under statement no 
the majority of such contracts  therefore  are not subject to the accounting requirements of statement no 
wisconsin public service entered into a limited number of commodity contracts that meet the definition of a derivative 
we believe that any gains or losses resulting from the settlement of these contracts will be collected from  or refunded to  retail customers 
derivative assets and liabilities that are recorded as a result of these derivative contracts will be offset with corresponding regulatory assets and liabilities 
a limited number of other derivative contracts were designated as fair value hedges 
future changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts will be recognized in earnings with offsetting changes in the value of the hedged item also recorded in earnings 
at january   wisconsin public service recorded a derivative asset and an offsetting regulatory liability of approximately million 
the cumulative effect on income was not significant 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold to customers at firm prices 
wps energy services also utilizes derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities 
primarily as a result of a change in strategic focus that resulted in a shift in customer mix  wps energy services  in applying emerging issues task force issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  concluded in the first quarter of that its energy contracts were trading contracts 
accordingly  wps energy services recorded its energy contracts at fair value on the balance sheet  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
because wps energy services marks to market its energy trading contracts in accordance with issue and does not anticipate designating any derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material impact at wps energy services 
electric utility restructuring wisconsin electric reliability continues to be the primary issue for the public service commission of wisconsin 
in  wisconsin enacted the reliability act which addressed asset cap relief provisions  the transfer of transmission assets into a state wide transmission company  targets for retail electric sales from renewable resources  and ratepayer funding of public benefits spending 
the priorities of the public service commission of wisconsin in included a market power study  formation of american transmission company  llc  utility membership in midwest independent system operator  the proposed transmission line between weston  wisconsin and duluth  minnesota  and ratepayer financing of public benefit spending and transferring responsibility for conservation  load management  and public benefits to the wisconsin department of administration 
market power study a consultant performed a market power analysis of wisconsin s and the upper peninsula of michigan s electric markets for the public service commission of wisconsin 
as a result of the analysis  the commission concluded that complete and immediate deregulation is not in the best interest of the public  especially given the recent developments in california 
the commission agreed that more transmission capacity is needed and contracts between electric generators and customers may mitigate market power issues 
additionally  the commission concluded that complex horizontal market power issues will require further study before actions to mitigate market power are considered 
transmission on january   all of the investor owned utilities in eastern wisconsin  including wisconsin public service  transferred their transmission assets to and became owners of american transmission company 
by joining american transmission company  the utilities became eligible for relief from the holding company system asset cap limitation on nonregulated investments 
until a regional transmission operator is operational  american transmission company will own and operate the eastern wisconsin transmission system 
wisconsin public service transferred transmission assets with a net book value of approximately million to million to american transmission company for an approximate ownership interest 
the ownership interest will fluctuate as additional assets are contributed or more companies join american transmission company 
we expect income under equity accounting for the investment in american transmission company to be similar to wisconsin public service s current earnings on its transmission assets 
final approval of the proposed transmission line between weston  wisconsin and duluth  minnesota is expected in this project will be transferred to american transmission company upon completion of hearings with the public service commission of wisconsin 
the hearings are expected to be completed in the first quarter of wps resources will be funding the equity portion of this transmission project and receiving additional ownership interest in american transmission company 
electric utility restructuring michigan in june  legislation was enacted which provides electric customers the right to choose their generation supplier by january  wisconsin public service  upper peninsula power  the michigan public service commission  and other utilities are developing systems to accommodate the new law  develop open access tariffs  and implement business practices 
preliminary tariffs are expected in the first quarter of gas utility restructuring wisconsin in its wisconsin retail rate application  wisconsin public service proposed to facilitate customer choice of natural gas suppliers through the use of its new automated meter reading system 
the proposal was approved by the public service commission of wisconsin and will provide customer choice of gas suppliers for commercial customers beginning on november  this program will be expanded to all customers as the automated meter reading system is installed system wide 
gas utility restructuring michigan the majority of michigan s largest gas customers are allowed to choose their natural gas commodity supplier 
gas restructuring for smaller customers remains in a pilot phase 
the smaller michigan natural gas utilities  including wisconsin public service  are to propose a customer choice program for all customer classes when it is in the best interests of each utility and its customers 
wisconsin public service intends to provide customer choice to its michigan customers following the implementation of its automated meter reading system in that state 
utility restructuring federal energy regulatory commission wisconsin public service transferred its electric transmission assets to american transmission company on january  in exchange for an ownership interest in the company 
american transmission company implemented new federal energy regulatory commission tariffs  subject to refund  on january  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power joined the midwest independent system operator in june of the midwest independent system operator filed to become a regional transmission organization in october of environmental wisconsin public service continues to investigate the environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites 
the cleanup of the stevens point manufactured gas plant site has been substantially completed with monitoring of the site continuing 
costs of this cleanup were within the range expected for this site 
future undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs for the remaining seven sites is estimated to be in the range of million to million 
these estimates may be adjusted in the future contingent upon remedial technology  regulatory requirements  and the assessment of natural resources damages 
wisconsin public service currently has a million liability recorded for gas plant cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge 
management believes that cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries  but not the carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures  will be recoverable in current and future customer rates 
wisconsin public service has received million in insurance recoveries which have been recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset 
the state of wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for wisconsin s ozone non attainment area in southern wisconsin 
the nitrogen oxide reductions begin in  and the requirements are gradually increased through this reduction plan affects edgewater unit wisconsin public service owns of this unit 
a compliance plan for edgewater unit was initiated in the plan includes a combination of combustion optimization and emission trading at a potential cost of approximately million 
the state of wisconsin is also seeking voluntary reductions from units outside the ozone non attainment area which may lead to additional expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units 
wisconsin public service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at the columbia energy center 
wisconsin public service owns of columbia 
the public service commission of wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs associated with nitrogen oxide compliance 
the wisconsin department of natural resources initiated a rulemaking effort aimed at the control of mercury emissions 
coal fired generation plants are likely to be the target of this effort 
a draft of the rule has not been released and the effect on wisconsin public service is not yet known 
if restrictive limits are adopted  the costs could be significant 
on november   the environmental protection agency announced that it was pursuing an enforcement initiative against seven utilities  or their subsidiaries  located in the midwest and the south as well as the tennessee valley authority 
the enforcement initiative alleges that the utilities may have undertaken projects at certain coal fired generation plants in violation of the clean air act 
the environmental protection agency is seeking penalties and the installation of additional pollution control equipment at these plants 
as a continuation of this initiative  the environmental protection agency requested  on december   that wisconsin public service provide information related to projects undertaken at its pulliam and weston plants 
this information was submitted on january  wisconsin power and light company  the operator of units co owned with wisconsin public service  also submitted information related to projects undertaken at the columbia and edgewater plants 
the sunbury plant  acquired by wps power development in november  currently purchases emission allowances to comply with air regulations 
additional technology may be required by in order to comply with nitrogen oxide standards 
expenditures for this technology could be significant 
kewaunee nuclear power plant on september   wisconsin public service and madison gas and electric company entered into an agreement pursuant to which wisconsin public service will acquire madison gas and electric s share of the kewaunee plant 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon nuclear regulatory commission approval and steam generator replacement scheduled for the fall of  will result in wisconsin public service s ownership interest in the kewaunee plant increasing to 
on january   wisconsin public service s administrative employees at the kewaunee plant transferred to nuclear management company  llc 
as a result of these employees leaving the wisconsin public service benefit plans  a curtailment loss of million was experienced 
the majority of the curtailment loss was deferred as a regulatory asset 
a settlement gain is anticipated in as withdrawals are made 
the majority of the settlement gain will be recorded as a regulatory liability 
wisconsin public service anticipates a significant increase in kewaunee operating costs in due to expenditures related to nuclear regulatory commission compliance requirements and is seeking regulatory approval to defer all incremental costs for recovery in the next rate proceeding 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wisconsin public service s and upper peninsula power s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because rate forecasting assumes inflation  most of the inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wisconsin public service and upper peninsula power are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
results of operations wisconsin public service corporation wisconsin public service corporation is a regulated electric and gas utility 
electric operations accounted for approximately of revenues  while gas operations contributed to revenues 
compared with overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following chart wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues net income net income from electric utility operations was million in compared with million in net income from gas utility operations was million in and million in the primary reason for higher utility net income was a wisconsin retail electric rate increase and increased gas sales volumes as the result of winter weather that was colder in than in electric utility operations wisconsin public service s electric utility margin increased million  or  primarily due to a wisconsin retail electric rate increase which became effective on january  this rate increase was primarily intended to recover additional fuel and purchased power costs for the year 
the electric rate increase also took into account the expected gain on the sale of utility assets which is discussed under other electric and gas utility expenses income 
electric utility results thousands revenues fuel and purchased power margin sales in kilowatt hours electric utility revenues increased million  or  due to a increase in overall sales volume coupled with the wisconsin retail electric rate increase 
sales volumes increased in spite of summer weather that was cooler in than in fuel expense increased million  or  due to increased production at wisconsin public service s fossil fueled and combustion turbine generation plants 
in addition  the average cost of generation at the combustion turbine plants increased largely as a result of a higher unit cost of natural gas 
generation costs at the kewaunee nuclear power plant decreased in due to its scheduled outage for refueling and maintenance in the second quarter of a similar outage did not occur in the kewaunee plant was off line beginning april  and returned to power on june  during the scheduled outage  nuclear generation was replaced with additional fossil fuel and combustion turbine generation and additional purchased power 
wisconsin public service is the operator and owner of the kewaunee plant 
purchased power expense decreased million  however  largely due to a decrease in the cost per kilowatt hour of power purchases made by wisconsin public service in compared with the public service commission of wisconsin allows wisconsin public service to adjust prospectively the amount billed to wisconsin retail customers for fuel and purchased power if costs fall outside a specified range 
wisconsin public service is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annualized basis 
annual fuel costs at december  were within this window and  accordingly  no adjustment was initiated 
gas utility operations wisconsin public service s gas utility margin increased million  or  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in therm sales 
gas utility results thousands revenues purchase costs margin sales in therms winter weather was a factor for gas operations in weather was colder in than in  however  weather was warmer than normal in gas revenues increased million  or  as the result of a increase in the average unit cost of natural gas coupled with a increase in overall therm sales 
gas purchase costs increased million  or 
this increase resulted from a higher average unit cost of natural gas and higher gas volumes purchased of 
the higher unit cost of natural gas is reflected in both revenues and gas purchases  thus having little impact on margin 
under current regulatory practice  the public service commission of wisconsin and the michigan public service commission allow wisconsin public service to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause 
other electric and gas utility expenses income utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million 
electric utility operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to costs associated with the scheduled outage and other maintenance activities at the kewaunee plant 
higher earnings of million on the kewaunee plant s nuclear decommissioning fund resulted in increased other income in due to regulatory practices  this higher income was offset by increased depreciation and decommissioning expense 
other income also included a gain of million on the sale of a combustion turbine which wisconsin public service constructed for another wisconsin utility 
the public service commission of wisconsin considered this gain in the wisconsin retail electric rate adjustment which was effective january  compared with overview wisconsin public service s and results of operations are shown in the following chart wisconsin public service s results millions change operating revenues net income net income from electric utility operations was million in and million in net income from gas utility operations was million in and million in the primary reasons for higher utility net income were increased sales volumes coupled with the implementation of new wisconsin retail electric and gas rates 
electric utility operations the electric utility margin increased million in due to increased sales volumes coupled with the january  implementation of new wisconsin retail electric rates 
the public service commission of wisconsin authorized a increase in electric rates 
electric utility revenues increased million primarily due to the electric rate increase 
a increase in overall kilowatt hour sales also contributed to higher electric revenues 
included in electric revenues  but not in electric revenues  were surcharge revenues of million related to the recovery of the deferred costs for the kewaunee plant s steam generator repairs 
fuel expense increased million as a result of increased generation requirements at the combustion turbine and nuclear generation plants in partially offsetting this factor was a decrease in production at the coal fired generation plants as a result of both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities 
purchased power requirements increased million primarily due to additional purchase requirements 
purchase requirements increased due to the lack of production at its coal fired generation plants during the time they were off line for maintenance in in addition  the cost of purchases was higher in than in annual fuel costs at december  were within the fuel window and  accordingly  no adjustment was made to electric rates for fuel costs 
gas utility operations the gas utility margin increased million in this increase was primarily due to the implementation of a public service commission of wisconsin rate order which authorized a increase in wisconsin retail gas rates and to an increase in therm sales 
gas operating revenues increased million 
this increase was due to the implementation of new wisconsin retail gas rates and a increase in overall therm sales as a result of colder weather in although the winter weather was colder in than in  it was still warmer than normal 
gas utility revenues in were reduced by million for refunds from anr pipeline company which were passed on to wisconsin public service s customers 
gas purchase costs in were likewise reduced as this million refund was credited to gas expense 
gas purchase costs increased million due to increased sales and to a higher unit cost of natural gas 
other electric and gas utility expenses income utility operating expenses increased million primarily due to higher customer service expenses of million related to conservation expenditures  and higher pension costs of million due to a change in the assumptions used to calculate this expense 
also contributing to increased operating expenses were higher medical benefit expenses of million and higher electric distribution expenses of million 
maintenance expense increased million primarily due to additional costs of million at the coal fired generation plants and million at the other power generation plants for both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance activities 
offsetting these costs was a decrease in maintenance expense of million at the kewaunee plant 
a scheduled refueling outage at the kewaunee plant in caused nuclear maintenance expenses to be higher 
in addition  million in deferred costs for the kewaunee plant s steam generator repairs were recognized in maintenance of overhead distribution lines increased million in due to additional tree trimming  line clearance  and storm damage repairs 
overview of other nonutility operations a one time dividend of million was received in related to a land sale from an investment 
this dividend represented a one cent per share increase to earnings for balance sheet wisconsin public service compared with net utility plant increased million as the result of general business growth  implementation of the automated meter reading system  and additional funding and favorable returns in the nuclear decommissioning trusts 
customer and other receivables increased million as the result of additional sales volumes 
the higher unit cost of natural gas experienced  especially in december of  also contributed to the increased receivables balance 
likewise  accrued utility revenues increased million and accounts payable increased million largely due to the additional sales volumes and the higher unit cost of natural gas 
commercial paper increased million largely to finance capital needs 
financial condition wisconsin public service investments and financing special common stock dividends of million were paid by wisconsin public service to wps resources in equity infusions of million were made by wps resources to wisconsin public service in the special dividends and equity infusions allowed wisconsin public service s average equity capitalization and its capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established by the public service commission of wisconsin in its rate order 
cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds by million in short term borrowings through commercial paper increased million in addition to the net equity infusions 
pretax interest coverage was times for the months ended december  see the table below for wisconsin public service s credit ratings 
credit ratings standard poor s moody s wisconsin public service corporation bonds aa aa preferred stock aa aa commercial paper a p we normally use internally generated funds and short term borrowing to satisfy most of our capital requirements 
we may periodically issue additional long term debt to reduce short term debt and to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
equity infusions will be made as necessary to maintain the equity capitalization ratio as allowed by the public service commission of wisconsin in its recent rate proceeding 
the specific forms of financing  amounts  and timing will depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
however  up to million of fading lien bonds may be issued in wisconsin public service makes large investments in capital assets 
construction expenditures are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
this includes expenditures for the replacement of the kewaunee plant s steam generators 
in addition  other capital requirements for the three year period include contributions of approximately million to the kewaunee plant s decommissioning trust fund 
regulatory on december   wisconsin public service received an order from the public service commission of wisconsin authorizing a increase in retail electric rates and a increase in retail gas rates for a return on equity was approved 
the new rates were implemented on january  the public service commission of wisconsin did not approve a rate reopener but acknowledged that pursuant to statutes  wisconsin public service may request a reopener at any time 
merger with wisconsin fuel and light company on july   wps resources signed a merger agreement with wisconsin fuel and light company 
under the agreement  wisconsin fuel and light shareholders will receive shares of wps resources common stock for each share of wisconsin fuel and light s common stock

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks wps resources has potential market risk exposure related to interest rate risk  equity return and principal preservation risk  and commodity price risk 
there currently is no material exposure due to foreign currency risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to ongoing short term financing and a long term debt financing at wps power development 
exposure to equity return and principal preservation risk results from various debt and equity security investments in our employee benefit and nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
exposure to commodity price risk exists with respect to the price of coal  uranium  electricity  natural gas  and fuel oil 
wps resources has risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and uses derivative instruments to manage some of these exposures 
interest rate risk wps resources generally issues commercial paper  subject to varying interest rates  for short term borrowing 
the fluctuation of interest rates will have an impact on interest expense related to this short term borrowing 
we manage interest rate exposure by continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
the amount of commercial paper outstanding was million and million at december  and december  respectively 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have affected annual interest expense on this commercial paper by approximately million in and million in wisconsin public service also has outstanding a million master note that is subject to a variable interest rate adjusted daily 
wps resources is not exposed to changes in interest rates on most of its long term debt until such debt matures and may be refinanced at the then applicable rates 
sunbury generation  llc  a nonregulated subsidiary of wps resources  had an outstanding balance of approximately million on a variable rate nonrecourse loan at december  sunbury generation utilized interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate for of the loan beginning in may of and continuing through march of in january of  sunbury generation used an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate for the remaining of the loan beginning april  a change in interest rates of basis points would have affected annual interest expense in on the loan by approximately million 
wps resources currently does not employ any other interest rate swaps 
mid american power  llc  a nonregulated subsidiary of wps resources  currently has an outstanding balance of approximately million on a variable rate loan 
the interest rate is adjusted quarterly 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have affected annual interest expense on the loan by approximately million 
equity return and principal preservation risk wps resources currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits and nuclear decommissioning through various trust funds 
these funds are managed by various investment managers and hold investments in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
the pension liability is adequately funded and under normal market conditions future required contributions to the plan are unlikely 
changes in the market value of investments related to other employee benefits or nuclear decommissioning could impact future contributions 
wps resources monitors the trust fund portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
all decommissioning costs and most of the employee benefit costs relate to wps resources regulated utilities 
the majority of these costs are reflected in customers rates  mitigating any equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
commodity price risk exposure to commodity price risk exists with respect to the price of coal  uranium  electricity  natural gas  and fuel oil 
wps resources and its affiliates employ established policies and procedures to reduce the market risk associated with changing commodity prices  including utilizing various types of commodity and financial instruments 
management actively monitors commodity price risk exposure across all of its subsidiaries 
wps resources engages in minimal price risk management activities at its regulated utility operations because much of this risk exposure is recoverable through customer rates 
wps energy services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with the changing prices of natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers 
wps energy services also uses derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy purchases  as well as trading activities 
derivatives may include  but are not limited to  futures and forward contracts  basis swap agreements  and call and put options 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  all of wps energy services activities including all of its energy commodity purchase and sale contracts and its gas in storage inventory are classified as trading 
wps power development uses derivative commodity instruments in connection with the sale of its generated power 
for purposes of risk management disclosure  all of wps power development s activities are classified as non trading 
value at risk to measure commodity price risk exposure  wps resources performs a value at risk var analysis on third party exposures 
var is used to describe a probabilistic approach to managing the exposure to market risk 
the var amount represents the potential change in fair value that could occur from adverse changes in market factors within a given confidence level if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
var models are relatively sophisticated 
however  the quantitative risk information is limited by the parameters established in creating the model 
the instruments being utilized may have features that may trigger a potential loss in excess of the calculated amount if the changes in the underlying commodity price exceed the confidence level of the model used 
var is not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
at wps resources  var is estimated using a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the delta normal approximation is based on the assumption that changes in the value of the portfolio over short time periods  such as one day  are normally distributed 
it does not take into account higher order risk exposures  so it may not provide a good approximation of the risk in a portfolio with substantial option positions 
we utilized a delta normal approximation because our portfolio has limited exposure to optionality 
in  we switched from a tabular presentation of quantitative risk disclosure to a var presentation  because we believe var is a more effective risk monitoring tool 
our var amount for trading activities was calculated to be million at december  compared to million at december  our var amount for non trading activities was calculated to be million and million at december  and december   respectively 
however  a significant portion of the var amount related to non trading activities is mitigated by wps power development s generating capabilities  which are excluded from the var calculation 
for the year ended december   the average  high  and low var amounts for trading activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
the average  high  and low var amounts over the same reporting period for non trading activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at the beginning of the reporting period and the four quarter end amounts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through the purchase and sale of gas in canada by one of our nonregulated subsidiaries 
this risk is currently immaterial 
as the exposure increases  we expect to hedge a majority of the risk through the use of various financial instruments
