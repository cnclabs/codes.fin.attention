item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
nvr s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
interest rate risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and commitments 
lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers  while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans 
nvr has no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes 
nvr s mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities 
the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans  which are generally sold through optional and mandatory forward delivery contracts into the secondary markets 
substantially all of the mortgage banking segment s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments 
nvr also sells substantially all the mortgage servicing rights in bulk sales at predetermined prices which significantly reduces the market risk associated with these interest sensitive assets 
in the normal course of business  nvr also enters into contractual commitments involving financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend mortgage loans to customers and forward contracts to sell mortgage backed securities to broker dealers 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of market rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the balance sheet 
nvr enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single family homes with fixed expiration dates 
the commitments become effective when the borrowers lock in a specified interest rate within time frames established by nvr 
all mortgagors are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment 
market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the lock in of rates by the borrower and the sale date to a broker dealer 
this market risk is managed by entering into forward contracts optional and mandatory to deliver mortgage backed securities and whole loans at specific prices and dates to broker dealers and secondary market investors 
nvr has established policies governing which broker dealers can be used to conduct these activities 
market risk with respect to forward contracts arises from changes in the value of contractual positions due to fluctuations in interest rates 
nvr limits its exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between the total of commitments to customers and loans held for sale and forward contracts with investors and broker dealers 
there were mortgage loan commitments aggregating approximately  outstanding at december   with a fair value at december  of  and open forward delivery contracts to sell loans to third party investors aggregating approximately  at december   with a fair value at december  of  nvr s homebuilding segment generates operating liquidity and acquires capital assets through fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the homebuilding segment s primary variable rate debt is a working capital revolving credit facility that currently provides for unsecured borrowings up to  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
the working capital credit facility expires may  and outstanding amounts bear interest at the election of nvr  at i the base rate of interest announced by the working capital credit facility agent or ii above the eurodollar rate 
the weighted average interest rates for the amounts outstanding under the facility was for there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital revolving credit facility at december  the following table represents contractual balances of nvr s on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair values of those on balance sheet financial instruments  at december  the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and does not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness 
because nvr sells all of the mortgage loans it originates into the secondary markets  nvr has made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year 
consequently  outstanding warehouse borrowings and repurchase facilities are also assumed to mature in the first year
