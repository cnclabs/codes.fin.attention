item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the shift from conventional cottonseed varieties to transgenic varieties in the us continues 
overall  both domestic and international cottonseed sales were up while the soybean business was a disappointment 
domestically  despite low cotton fiber prices  picker cotton seed unit sales increased as did per unit selling prices 
d pl continued the successful execution of its international business plan as evidenced by the increase in international revenues 
conversely  soybean sales were below both expectations and sales due to pricing decisions that priced our products higher than those of the two southern soybean market leaders 
lower sales resulted in excess soybean seed and higher than expected inventory writeoffs 
due to poor weather and low cotton fiber prices the number of stripper cotton units sold fell below expectations and actual sales 
since the revenue potential per acre for farmers who plant in areas where stripper cotton varieties are grown is significantly lower than the potential for picker cotton grown elsewhere in the us  when commodity prices fall farmers will either choose not to plant the acreage or will plant it with less expensive conventional or farmer saved seed 
in august  the company announced a plant closing and a reorganization of the corporate staff which resulted in the company taking a million charge of which million was related to asset write down and million was for severance pay and related benefits to those terminated 
essentially all such severance payments were made by fiscal year end 
the changes were made to reduce excess plant capacity  to reduce production costs  and to reduce corporate overhead by eliminating positions and realigning the company s soybean breeding efforts 
the company expects annual payroll savings to approximate million in resulting from these charges 
the litigation with monsanto continues 
the trial court has acted on pending motions 
the parties are now in discovery 
as discussed in item and the footnotes to the financial statements  the company collected after d pl filed a lawsuit the million termination fee in and recorded it net of related expenses as an unusual item in fiscal in july  the company announced the consolidation of the three divisional sales and marketing staffs and three divisional technical services staffs into one company wide sales and marketing team and one company wide technical services team that will serve the three brands deltapine  suregrow  and paymaster 
approximately forty salaried positions were eliminated which generated severance pay and relocation costs of approximately million which were recorded as special charges 
actual savings approximated million in fiscal the three divisional research programs were combined into a single company wide program  and two new research facilities were launched in the company s effort to invest its resources where it believes it has the best opportunity for developing new products for commercial introduction 
outlook although cotton fiber prices continued to decline in  cotton farmers planted more cotton in over due in part to low commodity prices of potentially competing crops and the level of government payments under various farm programs 
at the present time  we expect domestic cotton acreage to remain relatively flat in for the same reasons noted above and since represents the last year of the freedom to farm bill put into effect in both houses of congress are presently working on farm legislation presently expected to go into effect in the provisions of this bill are not yet final and could in fact affect domestic planted acreage of cotton and other row crops after the expiration of the current farm bill 
total cotton acreage worldwide has remained relatively consistent at million to million acres over the last several decades 
the company continues to expand its ex us presence by forming new joint ventures and working to improve the operating results of existing ex us operations 
the tragic events of september  are not expected to directly affect our existing ex us operations in  however  the company s five year business plan includes target markets such as pakistan and uzbekistan 
presently we are unable to ascertain the effect of recent events on the company s longer term growth markets 
the company announced the recent signing of letters of intent with two parties in china to form two new ventures there in addition to the two existing ventures to further penetrate ex us markets in connection with the execution of its international business plans 
the company remains optimistic about its ability to execute its domestic and international growth strategies 
the company also continues to review and evaluate alternative sources and types of technology that could bring valuable products to farmers 
as agreements are reached with those parties  announcements will be made 
in the meantime  the company continues to maintain its cash position 
the necessity to do so will be regularly evaluated 
subsequent to august   the company  pursuant to its previously announced re purchase plan  has purchased in the open market  approximately  shares of its common stock and has increased its quarterly dividend to per share from 
the board reviews the dividend policy quarterly 
assuming the dividend rate is maintained through  the aggregate payments will be million paid to the holders of the million shares outstanding 
see risks and uncertainties located in this item net sales and licensing fees in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
this increase is primarily the result of a a continued market penetration of the company s stacked gene products in the domestic segment  b price increases in the domestic cotton segment  c increased export sales to mexico  greece  and brazil and d increased sales by the company s joint ventures in china and brazil 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by lower than expected sales of soybeans 
in  domestic transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in mexico  greece  china  and brazil 
in  soybean sales and licensing fees decreased from in  d pl s consolidated net sales and licensing fees increased to million from sales of million 
the increase is primarily the result of a increased sales of upland picker cottonseed varieties that contain either or both of the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies  b increased sales of roundup ready soybeans and c increased international sales 
in  domestic transgenic cottonseed sales comprised approximately of total domestic unit sales of cottonseed  compared to approximately in roundup ready soybean units comprised approximately of total units sold in compared to in international sales increased to million in from million in due to sales increases in china  australia and greece 
the effects of these increases were partially offset by a decline in export sales in certain smaller markets 
gross profit d pl s consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to continued penetration of transgenic cottonseed varieties in the us  a price increase in the us market  and increased sales in the company s international segment as discussed above  the positive effects of which were partly offset by lower soybean margins 
d pl s consolidated gross profit increased to million in compared to million in this is primarily attributable to the increased penetration of transgenic cottonseed varieties in the us  increased sales in the company s international segment as discussed above and the absence of special charges in compared to special charges of million which were recorded in operating expenses operating expenses before special charges increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to higher general and administrative and research costs which were partially offset by continued cost savings generated from the company s reorganization of the sales and marketing staff and the related synergies for the company s advertising and promotional efforts 
operating expenses before special charges decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to savings which resulted from the reorganization of the company s sales and marketing and technical service staffs which were partially offset by higher research and general and administrative costs 
in  special charges related to severance pay and benefits of million resulting from the elimination of the divisional sales and marketing and divisional technical services staffs  and costs associated with the ultimately terminated merger with monsanto which approximated million  were included as operating expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional breeding programs in georgia and texas  advanced breeding programs  evaluation of new technologies  and additional international seed testing 
research and development expenses did not change materially in from levels since savings achieved by the consolidation were offset by the cost of new research programs 
selling expenses selling expenses decreased to million in from million in selling expenses decreased to million in from million in these decreases are primarily attributable to the company s previous reorganization of the sales and marketing staff and the related synergies of combining the company s advertising and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily consists of an increase in property  casualty and health insurance costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase primarily consists of expenses related to expansion of the company s operations in argentina and brazil  an increase in insurance costs and higher legal fees associated with the non us patents  trademark and variety registrations 
special charges and unusual item in connection with the closing of its chandler  arizona delinting facility  as of august   and the reduction in its domestic operations and corporate staffs  the company recorded a million charge for the severance  plant closing  and related costs associated with these actions 
of the million  million is related to the write down of fixed assets and million to severance pay and related benefits 
in fiscal  the company reported  as an unusual income item  the million merger termination fee  net of related expenses  which was paid by monsanto to d pl pursuant to the terms of the may   merger agreement 
in  the company incurred approximately million in costs related to the planned merger with monsanto 
such costs are primarily legal and professional fees and reserves established for losses on the planned disposition of certain assets

the number of shares deemed outstanding was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonal nature of the company s business significantly impacts cash flow and working capital requirements 
the company has maintained credit facilities  and used early payments by customers and cash from operations to fund working capital needs 
for more than years d pl has borrowed on a short term basis to meet seasonal working capital needs 
however  cash generated from operations in and along with the collection of the merger termination fee has been used to meet working capital needs in and to a lesser degree in the company is currently evaluating potential uses of its cash for purposes other than for working capital needs 
one potential such use is the acquisition or funding of alternative technologies that could be used to enhance the company s product portfolio and ultimately the company s long term earnings potential 
another potential use is the repurchase in the open market of the company s shares pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program 
subsequent to august   the company repurchased approximately  shares 
once the evaluation of certain transactions that are currently being considered is brought to conclusion perhaps resulting in such acquisitions  the company may reconsider other potential uses of the remaining cash  up to and including repurchasing shares more aggressively depending on market considerations and other factors 
in the united states  d pl purchases seed from contract growers in its first and second fiscal quarters 
seed conditioning  treating and packaging commence late in the first fiscal quarter and continue through the third fiscal quarter 
seasonal cash needs normally begin to increase in the first fiscal quarter and cash needs peak in the third fiscal quarter 
cash is generated and loan repayments normally begin in the middle of the third fiscal quarter and are typically completed by the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
d pl also offers customers financial incentives to make early payments 
to the extent d pl attracts early payments from customers  bank borrowings under the credit facility are reduced 
in the united states  the company records accounts receivable for licensing fees on bollgard and roundup ready seed sales as the seed is shipped  usually in the company s second and third quarters 
the company has contracted the billing and collection activities for bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees to monsanto 
in september  the technology fees are due at which time d pl  as managing partner of d m partners  receives payment from monsanto 
d pl then pays monsanto its royalty for the bollgard and roundup ready licensing fees 
as a result of the timing of these events  accounts receivable and accrued expenses generally peak at year end 
in april  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with its then existing lender and two other financial institutions which provided for aggregate borrowings of million 
this agreement provided a base commitment of million and a seasonal commitment of million 
the base commitment was a long term loan that could be borrowed upon at any time and was due april  the seasonal commitment was a working capital loan that could be drawn upon from september through june of each fiscal year 
each commitment offered variable and fixed interest rate options and required the company to pay facility or commitment fees and to comply with certain financial covenants 
this agreement expired on april  the financial covenants under the loan agreements required the company to a maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at august  of less than or equal to to to at the company s other quarter ends b maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio at the end of each quarter greater than or equal to to and c maintain at all times tangible net worth of not less than the sum of i million plus ii of net income but not losses determined on the last day of each fiscal year  commencing with august  at august   the company was in compliance with the covenants of the now expired credit facility 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item d pl and the lenders are currently negotiating a replacement facility that will provide for aggregate borrowings of million plus a million overline and will contain terms and conditions similar to the facility 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures are expected to approximate million in in  the company paid dividends aggregating million  approximately per share 
in november the board increased the quarterly dividend  commencing with the first quarter  to per share 
the board reviews the dividend policy quarterly 
however  assuming that the present rate is maintained throughout  aggregate dividends will approximate million in cash provided from operations  cash on hand  early payments from customers and borrowings under the loan agreement if necessary should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs 
risks and uncertainties from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  existing products  technical developments  new products  new technologies  research and development activities  and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include those noted elsewhere in this item and filing and the following demand for d pl s seed will be affected by government programs and policies and  most importantly  by weather 
demand for seed is also influenced by commodity prices and the demand for a crop s end uses such as textiles  animal feed  food and raw materials for industrial use 
these factors  along with weather  influence the cost and availability of seed for subsequent seasons 
weather impacts crop yields  commodity prices and the planting decisions that farmers make regarding both original planting commitments and  when necessary  replanting levels 
the planting seed market is highly competitive  and d pl products face competition from a number of seed companies  diversified chemical companies  agricultural biotechnology companies  governmental agencies and academic and scientific institutions 
a number of chemical and biotechnology companies have seed production and or distribution capabilities to ensure market access for new seed products and new technologies that may compete with the bollgard and roundup ready gene technologies 
the company s seed products and technologies contained therein may encounter substantial competition from technological advances by others or products from new market entrants 
many of the company s competitors are  or are affiliated with  large diversified companies that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the production  distribution or sale of crop seed in or to foreign markets may be subject to special risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rate controls  expropriation  nationalization and other agricultural  economic  tax and regulatory policies of foreign governments 
particular policies which may affect the domestic and international operations of d pl include the use of and the acceptance of products that were produced from plants that were genetically modified  the testing  quarantine and other restrictions relating to the import and export of plants and seed products and the availability or lack thereof of proprietary protection for plant products 
in addition  united states government policies  particularly those affecting foreign trade and investment  may impact the company s international operations 
the publicity related to genetically modified organisms gmos or products made from plants that contain gmos may have an effect on the company s sales in the future 
in  approximately of the company s cottonseed that was sold contained either the bollgard  roundup ready  or both gene technologies and of the company s soybean seed sales contained the roundup ready gene technology 
although many farmers have rapidly adopted these technologies  the alleged concern over finished products that contain gmos could impact demand for crops and ultimately seed raised from seed containing such traits 
due to the varying levels of agricultural and social development of the international markets in which the company operates and because of factors within the particular international markets targeted by the company  international profitability and growth may be less stable and predictable than domestic profitability and growth 
furthermore  recent action taken by the us government  including that taken by the us military in the aftermath of the tragic events of september   may serve to further complicate the company s ability to execute its long range ex us business plans because those plans include future expansion into uzbekistan and pakistan 
overall profitability will depend on the factors noted above as well as weather conditions  government policies in all countries where the company sells products and operates  worldwide commodity prices  the company s ability to successfully open new international markets  the company s ability to successfully continue the development of the high plains market  the technology partners ability to obtain timely government approval and maintain such approval for existing and for additional biotechnology products on which they and the company are working and the company s ability to produce sufficient commercial quantities of high quality planting seed of these products 
any delay in or inability to successfully complete these projects may affect future profitability
