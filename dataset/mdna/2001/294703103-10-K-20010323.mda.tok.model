the company elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with its taxable year ended december   and expects to continue to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been reflected in the financial statements 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
the company intends to pay these distributions from operating cash flows

the company anticipates that it will acquire any units tendered for redemption in the foreseeable future in exchange for shares of common stock and has agreed to register such shares so as to be freely tradeable by the recipient 
funds from operations industry analysts generally consider funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in accordance with the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
for the periods presented  depreciation  minority interest  the write off of non recurring merger expenses and the charge from write off of deferred organization costs were the company s only adjustments to net income for the definition of ffo 
the company s computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments with respect to indebtedness on the hotels 
the following reconciliation of net income to ffo illustrates the difference in the two measures of operating performance for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share and unit data net income   less gain on sale of hotel properties  preferred stock dividends   add minority interest depreciation of buildings  furniture and fixtures   loss on sale of hotel properties  change in accounting for corporate organization costs funds from operations   weighted average number of common shares and units outstanding   inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit the lessees ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  generally reflecting higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly lease revenues to the extent that it receives percentage rent 
impact of recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides guidance on revenue recognition 
sab requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until annual specified revenue levels have been achieved by the lessees 
during and prior years  the company has recognized contingent rentals throughout the year since it was considered probable that the lessees would exceed the annual specified hurdles 
the company has reviewed the terms of its percentage leases and has determined that the provisions of sab materially impact the company s revenue recognition on an interim basis  effectively deferring the recognition of revenue from its percentage leases from the first and second quarters of the calendar year to the third and fourth quarters 
sab will not impact the company s revenue recognition on an annual basis nor will it impact the company s interim or annual cash flow or its ffo from its lessees  and therefore will not effect its ability to pay dividends 
the company adopted sab as a change in accounting principle effective january  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  sfas requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a derivatives s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings  and any derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
the company adopted sfas in january the impact of adoption was immaterial and the company expects the impact to continue to be immaterial in future periods 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements containing the words believes  estimates  projects  anticipates  expects and words of similar import 
such forward looking statements relate to future events and the future financial performance of the company  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from the results or achievement expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant of which is the fluctuation in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related solely to its debt outstanding under its million line of credit 
total debt outstanding under the line of credit totaled million at december  for which the company was exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of borrowing under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s annual interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during the year ended december
