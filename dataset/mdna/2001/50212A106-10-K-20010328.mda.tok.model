liquidity and capital resources in june  the company refinanced its operating line of credit 
the new revolver  which provides for available borrowings up to million is a sweep account  which is set up to maintain the lowest possible balance on the revolver by maintaining a zero balance of cash at all times 
the line of credit contains various financial covenants and is collaterized by substantially all of the company s assets 
as of december   million of the million line of credit had been utilized 
in comparison  the company utilized million of the million line as of december  accounts receivable increased approximately from december  to december  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings increased approximately from december  to december   which reflects the unbilled accumulation of costs for new contract awards 
historically  the company has not made substantial capital expenditures for facilities  office and computer equipment 
capital expenditure to support customer contracts however  are quite substantial and are reported within the contract costs 
the company also has system project lease financing arrangements with commercial leasing organizations 
pursuant to these arrangements  the lessor purchases certain of the company s digital identification systems and leases them back to the company for deployment with identified and contracted customers approved by the lessor 
the lessor retains title to systems and has an assignment of the company s rights under the related customer contracts  including rights to use the software and technology underlying the related systems 
under this arrangement  the lessor bears the credit risk associated with payments by the company s customers  but the company bears performance and appropriation risk and is generally required to repurchase a system in the event of a termination by a customer for any reason except credit default 
the company is also required to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible capital funds  as defined 
these project lease arrangements are accounted for as capital leases 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under these lease financing arrangements

million is included in the current portion of capital lease obligations 
in february  the company obtained an additional million in project financing from a commercial bank 
the company has met all of it debt covenant requirements and believes that it will continue to meet all debt covenants 
however  this expectation is dependent on achieving the company s business plan 
if the company does not meet such covenants  the bank and the lessor could require immediate repayment of outstanding amounts 
in april  the company received a commitment from lau to lend up to  in exchange for a convertible subordinated note 
amounts drawn under the note  with lau s consent  and related accrued interest are convertible at lau s option into shares of the company s common stock at any time through the expiration date of january  at per share 
as of december   the company has borrowed  under this commitment 
the company does not intend to draw upon the remaining  commitment

on march   the company issued  of these shares of common stock to sri  and in may  the company issued the remaining  to sri 
the adjustable warrant terminates if the market value of the company common stock exceeds for any consecutive trading days prior to the adjustment periods 
if not terminated  the number of shares that may be acquired under the adjustable warrant is determined by a formula that is dependent on the extent to which the market value of the company s common stock is less than per share during the adjustment periods 
subject to certain closing conditions  two additional investments of  each may be invested by sri between and days after the initial investment and between and days thereafter on similar terms 
the company does not intend to draw upon the remaining  commitment 
the purchase price of the common stock for each additional investment will be equal to of the average per share market value for the ten trading days prior to the applicable closing date and the number of shares of common stock underlying the closing warrant will be equal to of the common stock sold pursuant to each investment at an exercise price equal to of the average per share market price for the five trading days prior to such closing date 
the subsequent adjustable warrant will terminate when the market value of the common stock on the applicable closing date exceeds for any consecutive trading days prior to the adjustment period

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize all derivative contracts at their fair values  as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge  the objective of which is to match the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging derivative with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk  or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
sfas no
