item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net sales consists of sales and freight  net of returns and discounts 
the company has experienced net sales growth each year since it began operations in the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to the growth in sales volume 
the company s branding and product differentiation strategy enables the company both to command premium prices and to maintain price stability for trex 
prices for trex over the last three years have increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
from time to time since  customer demand for trex has exceeded the company s manufacturing capacity 
the constraints on the company s capacity in these periods have limited the rate of the company s net sales growth 
such constraints substantially ended during the third quarter of the company s cost of sales consists of raw material costs  direct labor costs  manufacturing costs  including depreciation  and freight 
in the last three years  the cost of raw materials has increased an average of approximately annually 
almost all of the increases were attributable to higher costs of polyethylene and waste wood fiber  including shipping costs 
the positive effect on cost of sales in of productivity gains from the company s investment in manufacturing process improvements and the addition of production lines was offset by increases in raw material and direct labor costs 
production line rates have increased over since and the number of production lines has increased from one line in to lines in the principal component of selling  general and administrative expenses is branding and other sales and marketing costs  which have increased significantly as the company has sought to build brand awareness of trex in the decking market 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel  advertising expenses and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in research and development  procurement  accounting and other business functions and office occupancy costs attributable to these functions  as well as amortization expense

the company is amortizing its goodwill over a year period in an amount of approximately million per year 
the company did not record an income tax provision for any period through april   which was the date on which it completed the reorganization 
before its acquisition of mobil s composite products division  the company was included in the consolidated tax return of its parent company 
in the period between the acquisition and the reorganization  the company elected to be treated as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes  and the company s income during that period was taxed directly to the company s members  rather than to the company 
as a result of the reorganization  the company is subject to income tax as a corporation taxed in accordance with subchapter c of the internal revenue code 
in april  as a result of its conversion to c corporation status  the company recognized a million non cash charge against income for income tax expense 
the effect of this charge was to increase substantially the company s effective tax rate for that quarter and for the year ended december  the increased effective tax rate was recognized only in such quarter and  accordingly  the company believes that its effective tax rate for subsequent periods should not exceed approximately
