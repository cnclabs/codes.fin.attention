item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in exchange rates and prices 
the company conducts business in a number of foreign currencies  principally those of europe and asia  directly or in its foreign operations 
the company may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory in foreign currencies 
accordingly  microsemi is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of the company s business 
also these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on microsemi s revenues or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that those currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on the results of operations  cash flows and financial condition of the company 
the largest foreign currency exposure of the company results from activity in british pounds and the european union euro 
the company has not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
the company has and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
the company did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage its interest rate risk 
the company s other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  the company does not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
the company does not engage in transactions intended to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
on august   in connection with an acquisition of operating assets  the company issued a one year promissory note in the original principal amount of approximately million structured so that the interest expense on the maturity date will be in a range of a minimum of about million or up to a maximum of about million 
within that range  the interest rate is related linearly to the market price of the company s common stock on the maturity date divided by its price on the issuance date 
an increase in the market price of the company s common stock over the period will result in an increase in the related interest payable
