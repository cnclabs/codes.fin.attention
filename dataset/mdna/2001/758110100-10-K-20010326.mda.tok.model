during rockport is planning to introduce a continual flow of new products in an increased number of retail doors in the department and specialty store channels of distribution 
this expansion of retail shelf space will be supported by increased media spending for rockport s new lifestyle advertising campaign 
ralph lauren footwear had sales of million in  an increase of from million in the lauren line  which the company launched in  appears to be gaining greater consumer awareness  and the company believes that this has resulted in stronger product sell throughs at retail 
during  ralph lauren footwear plans to continue to expand its lauren distribution along with that of its most recent product line  polo jeans co 
footwear  which was launched this fall in selected retail doors 
over the long term  the company believes that this division has opportunities for growth in both the domestic and international markets 
the company s overall gross margin was of sales for  as compared to for  a decrease of basis points 
one of the primary reasons for the decline was the margin erosion in europe caused by the weakening of the euro and british pound sterling which have declined by as much as against the us dollar since december in order to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the company s gross margin in  the company implemented selective price increases in various countries in europe  value engineered certain products to provide greater efficiencies  and changed some of its sourcing strategies in order to take advantage of the strong us dollar 
based on these actions  the current exchange rates and the company s hedging strategy  the company believes that its gross margin performance during will be slightly down from selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of sales  as compared to billion  or of sales for a decline of million or basis points as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative expenses decreased 
the company s multiple brand strategy continues to enable the company to leverage many core competencies across all of its brands for greater business efficiencies 
the company expects to be able to generate revenue growth during and with that growth should come some operating leverage resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses declining as a percentage of sales 
included in this operating leverage is reebok s current plan to significantly increase its worldwide spending for advertising and other working media in order to generate greater consumer demand for its products and greater sell throughs for its retailers 
this marketing spend will be funded primarily from anticipated revenue increases  additional operating efficiencies  reallocating funds from non working to working media and from the elimination of programs which are not critical to the company s near term strategic focus 
interest expense decreased in as compared to as a result of strong cash flow generation and debt repayments 
other expense includes foreign currency losses and net losses from the sale or disposal of certain assets primarily related to facilities consolidation and the change in estimates for special charges 
also included in other expense is amortization of intangible assets of million for the year ended december  the company did not record any special charges during  but did change certain previously recorded estimates 
details of the special charge activity during are as follows termination legal employee fixed asset marketing of leases dollars in thousands total settlement severance write downs contracts and other balance  december       change in estimates    utilization       balance  december       the effective income tax rate was for as compared to for looking forward  dependent on the geographic mix of earnings in  the company expects that the full year rate will be approximately based on current estimates 
however  the rate could fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on where the company earns its income geographically  and  if the company incurs non benefitable losses in certain economically troubled regions  the rate could increase 
at december   the company had recorded net deferred tax assets of million  of which million is attributable to the expected utilization of tax net operating loss carryforwards 
the remainder  million  is attributable to tax credit carryforwards and the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the estimate of future taxable income relates to operations of the company which have  in the past  generated a level of taxable income in excess of amounts of future taxable income necessary to realize the deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company has tax planning strategies which can utilize a portion of the tax net operating loss carryforwards and thereby reduce the likelihood that they will expire unused 
however  if the company s estimates of future taxable income are not realized in the near term  the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets could be reduced thereby impacting future net income 
in december  the company announced it had entered into an agreement in principle with the national football league nfl

in addition  the company will grant warrants to the nfl to purchase up to million shares of the company s common stock

the reebok division s worldwide sales including the sales of the greg norman collection were billion in  a decrease from sales of billion in us footwear sales of the reebok brand decreased to million in from billion in us footwear sales in most categories declined 
the classic category declined partially as a result of the company s effort to redefine its distribution strategy in anticipation of new classic product extensions that began in year us apparel sales of the reebok brand decreased by to million from million in during  there was general softness in the us for branded athletic apparel 
these market conditions  combined with the company s efforts to strategically reposition the us business by limiting distribution and eliminating many unprofitable product offerings  had an adverse impact on us apparel revenues 
sales of greg norman apparel also declined in the year 
during  the domestic golf and branded apparel market was promotional and overdistributed

and ralph lauren children s apparel categories 
during  the company increased its advertising and marketing commitment for this brand and continued this investment through much of the company s overall gross margin was of sales for  as compared to for  an increase of basis points 
the increase is primarily attributable to the strengthening of the company s initial pricing margins due to manufacturing and sourcing efficiencies and to lower markdowns  cancellations and returns for the reebok brand

details of the special charge activity during are as follows termination legal employee fixed asset marketing of leases dollars in thousands total settlement severance write downs contracts and other balance  december       charge      change in estimates   utilization       balance  december       interest expense decreased in as compared to as a result of strong cash flow generation and debt repayments

us backlog for the reebok brand  increased and the international backlog  which includes canada  increased in constant dollars or 
in reported dollars 
reebok s us footwear backlog increased and reebok us apparel backlog including greg norman collection apparel increased as compared to the same period last year 
these open backlog comparisons are not necessarily indicative of future sales trends 
many orders are cancelable  sales by company owned retail stores can vary from year to year  many markets in latin america and asia pacific are not included in the open orders since sales are made by independent distributors and the ratio of orders booked early to at once shipments can vary from period to period

capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately to million 
cash generated from operations  together with the company s existing credit lines and other financial resources  is expected to adequately finance the company s planned cash requirements 
however  the company s actual experience may differ from the expectations set forth in the preceding sentence 
factors that might lead to a difference include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k under the heading issues and uncertainties  as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing the company s available cash balances such as unexpected operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures  as well as increases in the company s inventory or accounts receivable  or future events that might reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 
contingencies as with its international sales operations  the company s footwear and apparel production operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  quotas and other threats to free trade  foreign currency fluctuations and restrictions  labor unrest and political instability  as more fully described above in the section entitled trade policy 
the company believes that it has the ability to develop  over time  adequate substitute sources of supply for the products obtained from present foreign suppliers 
if  however  events should prevent the company from acquiring products from its suppliers in china  indonesia  or thailand  or significantly increase the cost to the company of such products  the company s operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers were found  with a significant negative financial impact 
for several years  imports from china to the united states  including footwear  have been threatened with higher or prohibitive tariff rates  either through statutory action or intervention by the executive branch  due to concern over china s trade policies  human rights  foreign weapons sales practices and its foreign policy 
further debate on these issues is expected to continue in if china is admitted to the world trade organization the wto  the likelihood of future trade restrictions on china sourced products by the united states and other nations would be reduced 
if china joins the wto by the rd quarter  it will be granted permanent normal trade relations pntr status  eliminating the annual review process regarding trade status and further reduce the likelihood of future trade restrictions on china sourced products by the united states 
should china not join the wto  congress will again debate pntr 
whether or not china is admitted to the wto and or granted permanent normal trade relations status  the company does not currently anticipate that restrictions on imports from china will be imposed by the united states during if adverse action is taken with respect to imports from china  it could have an adverse effect on some or all of the company s product lines  which could result in a negative financial impact 
the company has put in place contingency plans that should allow it to diversify some of its sourcing to countries other than china if any such adverse action occurred 
in addition  the company does not believe that it would be more negatively impacted by any such adverse action than its major competitors 
the actual effect of any such action will  however  depend on a number of factors  including how reliant the company  as compared to its competitors  is on production in china and the effectiveness of the contingency plans put in place 
the european union the eu imposed import quotas on certain footwear from china in the effect of such quota scheme on the company has not been significant because the quota scheme provides an exemption for certain higher priced special technology athletic footwear  which exemption is available for most reebok products and some rockport products 
the eu and individual eu member states continue to review the athletic footwear exemption which applies to both the quota scheme and antidumping duties discussed below 
the company  on its own as well as through relevant trade associations  is working to prevent imposition of a more limited athletic footwear exception 
should revisions be adopted narrowing such exemption  certain of the company s product lines could be affected adversely  requiring sourcing from countries other than china  or minor design modification 
should any narrowing of the exemption be imposed  the company does not expect that its products would be more severely affected than those of its major competitors 
in addition to the quotas on china sourced footwear  the eu has imposed antidumping duties against certain textile upper footwear from china and indonesia 
a broad exemption from the dumping duties is provided for athletic textile footwear  which covers most reebok models 
if the athletic footwear exemption remains in its current form  few reebok product lines will be affected by the duties  however  rockport products would be subject to these duties 
nevertheless  the company believes that those reebok and rockport products affected by the duties can generally be sourced from other countries not subject to such duties 
if  however  the company were unable to implement such alternative sourcing arrangements  certain of its product lines could be adversely affected by these duties 
the eu also has imposed antidumping duties on certain leather upper footwear from china  thailand and indonesia 
these duties apply only to low cost footwear  below the import prices of most reebok and rockport products 
thus the company s products have not been significantly impacted by such duties 
the eu continues to expand the list of restricted substances in consumer products 
the company has taken aggressive steps to assure that its suppliers and factories are in full compliance with eu directives and enforcement initiatives of eu member states in accordance with the terms of their agreements 
despite these efforts  from time to time the company may have some product already in the distribution chain that does not comply with the most recent eu directives 
this could cause some disruption to the delivery of product to the market 
as a result  it may be necessary to substitute styles  to delay deliveries or even to forego sales 
the company believes that its major competitors are similarly impacted by these eu restrictions 
the company is also aware of possible consumer rejection of products containing substances not restricted by the eu or any member state for environmental  health and human rights concerns 
such consumer action  and the response of retailers  could disrupt company distribution and cause withdrawal of the product from the market  which would substantially impact the company s sales of those specific products 
to date the company has not encountered rejection on any of its products  but is aware of such consumer action against certain competitors products  which has lead to the voluntary recall of such products 
while it is impossible to predict such consumer action  the company is closely monitoring the demands of non governmental organizations active in europe 
the company believes that it is no more exposed to such adverse action than its major competitors 
various other countries have taken or are considering steps to restrict footwear imports or impose additional customs duties or other impediments  which actions affect the company as well as other footwear importers 
the company  in conjunction with other footwear importers  is aggressively challenging such restrictions and is attempting to develop new production capacity in countries not subject to those restrictions 
nevertheless  such restrictions have in some cases had a significant adverse effect on the company s sales in some of such countries  most notably argentina  although they have not had a material adverse effect on the company as a whole 
lawsuits arise during the normal course of business 
the company does not expect the outcome of any existing litigation to have a significant impact on its financial position or future results of operations 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure for merchandise purchased in us dollars that will be sold to customers in other currencies 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in net income except that gains and losses on contracts which hedge specific foreign currency commitments are deferred and accounted for as a part of the transaction 
the company also uses forward currency exchange contracts and options to hedge significant intercompany assets and liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency 
contracts used to hedge intercompany balances are marked to market and the resulting transaction gain or loss is included in the determination of net income 
foreign currency losses realized from settlements of transactions included in other income expense for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company has used forward exchange contracts and options as an element of its risk management strategy for several years 
at december   the company had forward currency exchange contracts and options  all having maturities of less than one year  with a notional amount aggregating million 
the contracts involved twelve different foreign currencies  of which the euro currency represented of the aggregate notional amount 
the notional amount of the contracts intended to hedge merchandise purchases was million 
deferred gains losses on these contracts were not material at december  or the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of its variable rate long term debt from floating to fixed rates 
these agreements are also used to manage interest rate exposure under certain of the company s leases 
these agreements involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the effect of leverage and without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate differentials paid or received under these swap agreements are recognized over the life of the contracts as adjustments to interest expense or rent expense 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was million 
interest expense in  and would not have been materially different if these swap agreements had not been used 
financial instruments which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  accounts receivable and hedging instruments 
the company places cash equivalents with high credit major financial institutions and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
credit risk on trade receivables is somewhat minimized as a result of the company s worldwide customer base and the fact that no one customer represents or more of the company s net sales 
the company is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to hedging instruments 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties and places dollar and term limits on the amount of contracts it enters into with any one party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to its international sales  production  and funding requirements 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is the company s policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting and other strategies cannot be effectively employed 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its portfolio of borrowings 
the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy  or as may be required by certain loan agreements 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure for merchandise purchased in us dollars that will be sold to customers in other currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency exchange contracts and options to hedge significant inter company assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies 
accordingly  these contracts change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of these assets  liabilities  and merchandise purchases 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company prepared a sensitivity analysis of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the company s results of operations  cash flows  and the fair value of its financial instruments 
the interest rate analysis assumed a basis point adverse change in interest rates of all financial instruments 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by in the same direction relative to the us dollar on all financial instruments 
based on the results of these analyses of the company s financial instruments  a basis point adverse change in interest rates from year end levels would reduce the fair value of the interest rate swaps by million and a adverse change in foreign currency rates would reduce the fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts and options by million 
in addition  a basis point increase in interest rates from year end levels would increase interest expense on floating rate debt net of hedges by million
