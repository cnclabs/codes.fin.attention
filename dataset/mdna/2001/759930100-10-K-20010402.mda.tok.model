item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
as of december   the company provided dialysis and ancillary services to approximately  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services in hospitals 
the company also provides limited wound care and diabetic care services  however  as announced on september   the company has determined to exit the wound care business by june  for the comparison discussion that follows  the selected financial data include the financial information of some companies acquired in previously reported transactions accounted for as poolings of interests 
on april   the company merged with renal disease management by physicians  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
consistent with other pooling of interests transactions  the comparison discussion that follows includes financial information that include the combined results of renal care group and renal disease management by physicians  inc because the companies added in pooling transactions were independent and not operated by renal care group s management before the dates of acquisition  the historical results of such companies before such times may not be indicative of future performance 
renal care group s net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with outpatient dialysis  primarily the administration of epo  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided to acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  management contracts with hospital based and medical university dialysis programs  and laboratory services 
patients with end stage renal disease typically receive three dialysis treatments each week in an outpatient setting  with reimbursement for these services provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by the health care financing administration 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
effective on both january  and january   congress increased the medicare composite rate by each year 
an additional increase of is scheduled to take effect april  the april  increase includes an adjustment factor that makes that increase effective for all of accordingly  the net result of the increases on january  and april   plus the april adjustment factor  is a effective increase for calendar year in light of the recommendations of propac  management believes that an increase in the composite rate for is unlikely 
the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for such treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services provided by renal care group 
certain other services  laboratory tests  and drugs are eligible for separate reimbursement under medicare and are not part of the composite rate  including specific drugs such as epo and certain physician ordered tests provided to dialysis patients 
for patients with private health insurance  dialysis is typically reimbursed at rates higher than medicare during the first months of treatment 
after that period medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and generally is higher on a per treatment equivalent basis than the medicare composite rate 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy used to treat a chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
renal care group derives a significant portion of its net revenue and net income from the administration of epo 
epo is manufactured by a single company 
in february  this manufacturer implemented a increase in its price for epo 
renal care group estimates that this price increase reduced its earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  results of operations on april   the company merged with renal disease management by physicians  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests  and on january  the company merged with dialysis centers of america  inc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests

each of renal care group s subsidiaries has guaranteed all of renal care group s obligations under the loan agreement 
further  renal care group s obligations under the loan agreement  and the obligations of each of its subsidiaries under its guaranty  are secured by a pledge of the equity interests held by renal care group in each of the subsidiaries 
financial covenants are customary based on the amount and duration of this commitment 
a significant component of renal care group s growth strategy is the acquisition and development of dialysis facilities 
there can be no assurance that renal care group will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to close acquisition transactions with them on acceptable terms 
management of renal care group believes that existing cash and funds from operations  together with funds available under the line of credit  will be sufficient to meet renal care group s acquisition  expansion  capital expenditure and working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
however  in order to finance certain large strategic acquisition opportunities  renal care group may incur additional short and long term bank indebtedness and may issue equity or debt securities 
the availability and terms of any future indebtedness or securities will depend on market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if required  will be available on terms acceptable to renal care group 
capital expenditures of approximately million to million  primarily for equipment replacement  expansion of existing dialysis facilities and construction of de novo facilities are planned in the company expects that these capital expenditures will be funded with cash provided by operating activities and the company s existing credit facility

newly issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb in march this interpretation was effective july   and covers specific events that occur after either december  or january  the interpretation addresses and further clarifies certain aspects of apb such as the definition of an employee  criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as non compensatory  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of previously granted stock options  or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
renal care group  inc has adopted this interpretation  and management believes it is in compliance with such requirements 
impact of inflation a substantial portion of renal care group s net revenue is subject to reimbursement rates that are regulated by the federal government and do not automatically adjust for inflation 
renal care group is unable to increase the amount it receives for the services provided by its dialysis business that are reimbursed under the medicare composite rate 
increased operating costs due to inflation  such as labor and supply costs  without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates  may adversely affect renal care group s results of operations  financial condition and business
