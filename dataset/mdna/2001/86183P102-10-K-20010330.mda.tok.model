item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  the company uses derivative financial instruments 
specifically  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net income by changing the floating interest rates on certain portions of the company s debt to fixed interest rates 
the effect of changes in interest rates on the company s net income generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect net income  such as sales and operating margins 
management believes that its use of these financial instruments to reduce risk is in the company s best interest 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company s risks related to commodity price and foreign currency exchange risks have historically not been material 
the company does not expect the effects of these risks to be material based on current operating and economic conditions in the countries and markets in which it operates
