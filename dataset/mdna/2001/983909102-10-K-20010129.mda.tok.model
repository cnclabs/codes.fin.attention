item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended october   the company reported record net income and revenues of million and million  respectively 
these results represent a increase in net income and a increase in revenues and reflect the first year of the company s efforts to expand beyond its traditional focus on the lodging industry into the distribution of telecommunications products and services to commercial businesses on a nation wide basis 
as a result of this aggressive expansion strategy  many important developments occurred during fiscal these developments are discussed in detail below 
the company s strategy to expand beyond the lodging industry into the commercial market is being fueled by significant changes in technology that are beginning to occur and are expected to accelerate during the next three to five years 
the most significant of these technology changes is the development of packet switching 
this technology is the mechanism by which data travels over the internet and other data networks  usually using a standard form of transmission  called ip or internet protocol 
however  advances have now been made to enable voice traffic to be carried over these same ip networks voice over ip or voip at acceptable quality 
the convergence of data and voice traffic over the same networks is being driven by cost as it is more cost effective to install and maintain one integrated network than two separate networks for data and voice 
as a result of these changes in technology  the distribution channels which provide traditional voice products and services are changing dramatically as well 
in june   the company announced a three phase strategy to respond to these changes and rapidly expand its business 
phase one is to establish a nation wide commercial customer beachhead to deliver traditional telephony applications 
phase two of the strategy is to add complex convergence applications such as voip telephony  call centers and unified messaging 
finally  phase three of the strategy is to introduce professional and consulting services to design these integrated networks and complex applications as well as to audit their efficiency 
management believes that by executing these strategies  the company will come to market with a fully integrated business model in which it can prospect for customers based on nearly any need the customer may have or may need addressed 
for example  the company may make initial contact with the customer based on a product need such as after market components 
subsequently  the customer can be introduced to other products and services such as network efficiency audits  traditional services maintenance contracts  installation of upgrades  etc  messaging systems  or complex applications such as virtual private networks 
the company is executing this strategy using a balanced approach of acquisitions and internal growth 
during fiscal  the company completed the acquisition of two companies 
on november   the company purchased of the outstanding stock of us technologies systems  inc usti for million in cash and  shares of xeta common stock held in treasury with a market value of million on the date issued 
the company paid million in cash at closing and the remaining million was subject to various hold back provisions 
as of october   hold back provisions regarding million of the total were satisfied and this amount plus accrued interest was paid on november  on february   the company purchased substantially all of the assets of advanced communication technologies  inc act for approximately million in cash 
both of these companies primary focus was in voice applications 
as a result of these acquisitions and internal growth accomplished during the year  the company was able to largely achieve phase one of its strategy in fiscal subsequent to the close of fiscal  the company made two additional acquisitions to begin its expansion into converged products and professional services  phases two and three of its strategy  respectively 
on november   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of pro networks corporation  a missouri based company specializing in the sale  installation and service of data networking equipment  including cisco s data products and virtual private networking solution as well as avaya s data products 
simultaneously  the company also purchased the assets of a professional services firm  key metrology integration  inc kmi 
most of kmi s employees are microsoft certified systems engineers mcses 
the company expects to use kmi as its starting point to provide high end lan wan consulting services and unified messaging solutions 
the company paid a total of million in cash for the assets of these two companies  and will pay up to an additional million if various growth targets are met 
each of the four acquisitions discussed above were funded from proceeds of a million credit facility which is more fully described under liquidity and capital resources below 
on june   the company reduced the par value of its common stock to 
and increased the authorized shares to million 
on june   the company effected a two for one stock split by reducing the par value on its common stock to 
all share amounts reflected in this report have been restated accordingly to give effect to the stock split 
the discussion below provides further analysis of the developments discussed above as well as other major factors and trends which management believes had the most impact on the results of operations for the years ended october  and compared to the previous years  and the financial condition of the company for the years then ended 
the preceding and the following discussions contain forward looking statements  which are subject to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include statements concerning expectations regarding the company s sales  revenues  gross margins  operating margins and results of operations  the company s ability to implement its current business plan and growth strategy  and trends in the communications technology industry and hospitality markets 
these and other forward looking statements generally identified by such words as expects  plans  believes  anticipates and similar words or expressions are not guarantees of performance but rather reflect management s current expectations  assumptions and beliefs based upon information currently available to management 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these risks and uncertainties are described under the heading outlook and risk factors below 
consequently  all forward looking statements should be read as in conjunction with the risk factors discussed herein and throughout this report 
results of operations year ended october  compared to october  as stated above  net revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or over the previous year 
of this increase  approximately million represented revenues earned from companies acquired during the year 
commercial equipment sales 
sales of products to commercial customers were million in fiscal and represented revenues earned from the former operations of usti and act since their acquisition months and months  respectively 
the company is a non exclusive dealer of avaya voice products to the commercial market and sells avaya s full range of communications servers as well as component parts in after market sales 
the company focuses on two primary commercial market segments  small of large locations of fortune companies the fortune market and the next largest enterprises the enterprise market 
sales to the fortune market are mainly generated through partnering arrangements with avaya s direct sales force to sell and install communications systems to avaya s customers 
under these partnering arrangements  the company assists avaya in assessing the customer s needs and in design  sale  installation and sometimes support of the applications or project 
although there is fierce competition among avaya dealers to participate in these partnering opportunities  management believes the company is uniquely qualified because of its nationwide project management capabilities and competencies in complex applications 
the company also focuses its efforts in the commercial market segment on the enterprise market  representing mid sized companies that typically have multiple locations 
generally  the revenues earned from the former usti operations are more likely to originate from the avaya partnering arrangements  while the revenues earned in the pacific northwest from the former act operations are more likely to originate from enterprise customers in that region 
the company intends to aggressively grow its revenues earned from enterprise customers during fiscal while continuing its strong relationships with the avaya direct sales staff 
lodging systems sales 
sales of lodging systems declined million or 
this decline consisted of a decrease in sales of call accounting systems of million or and an increase in sales of communications systems pbx s to the lodging market of  or 
sales of call accounting products in fiscal returned to more normal levels after the surge in orders experienced in  as many customers upgraded or replaced their systems in preparation for yk 
in addition  the capital available to the lodging industry for new construction  remodeling  and investments in technology shrunk considerably in  resulting in extended sales cycles and fierce competition 
the company was able to offset some of the impact of these trends through its offering of the avaya guestworks pbx system 
the avaya system enabled the company to break into new customer accounts who were not previously receptive to the company s hitachi pbx offering 
the company will continue to go to the lodging market with both products  although the company expects sales of new avaya systems to continue to exceed sales of hitachi systems  as was the case in fiscal management believes that the atmosphere of limited budgets and extended sales cycles may continue for the foreseeable future or could worsen if the us economy slows 
installation and service revenues 
installation and service revenues increased million or during fiscal approximately million of this increase was earned from the expansion of the company s service capabilities into the commercial market 
during fiscal  the company hired and trained additional technicians and implemented new provisioning processes and pricing strategies to address the needs of the commercial market 
revenues earned from the company s traditional lodging installation and service activities grew approximately million or 
this growth was fueled by increases in revenues earned from maintenance contracts and billable services on call accounting systems and pbx s  partially offset by decreases in installation revenues 
during  the company plans to continue to expand its service and installation presence in the commercial market and believes that by offering a proprietary maintenance contract it can create a recurring stream of service revenues similar to that long enjoyed by the company in the hospitality market 
other revenues 
other revenues consists of revenues earned from the remaining long distance services contracts still in force and from non recurring  low margin  sale of after market products in which the company acts a broker to facilitate the transaction for its customers 
the company is in the process of winding down its long distance services business as the remaining contracts to provide those services expire in fiscal the sale of after market products included in this revenue caption involve transactions in which the company procures large quantities of after market components  typically telephone sets  for end user customers 
in these transactions  the company typically does not take possession of the equipment  but simply has the equipment drop shipped directly to the customer s location  earning a small fee to process  bill and collect on the transaction 
gross margins 
total gross margins earned in were compared to in this decline was expected as a result of a dramatic and planned change in product mix toward the commercial market for voice and data products 
as the company has executed its growth strategy through acquiring companies operating in the commercial market  the percentage of its business earned from higher margin  specialized lodging products and services has declined as a portion of total revenues 
management expects the overall gross margins earned by its new business model to be in a range of  with some individual sectors of its integrated business model to earn gross margins significantly higher and some sectors to be lower than this blended rate 
generally  the company expects its traditional voice systems to be within the blended range outlined above while the margins on data and converged products will be lower  and the margins on high end applications and professional consulting services will be higher 
the gross margins earned on commercial equipment sales in fiscal were 
the company intends to continue to aggressively pursue the avaya partnering opportunities that it enjoyed in fiscal  although the margins earned on these sales are often lower than the company s target for this revenue stream because of the buying power of these large  fortune customers and fierce competition for this segment of the business 
in fiscal  management intends to enhance its overall commercial equipment margins by selling more equipment into the enterprise customer base and by shifting its product mix toward larger systems 
the gross margins earned on lodging systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decline represents a change in product mix in toward sales of more pbx systems and fewer call accounting systems as a portion of total lodging systems sales 
as a proprietary product  the company s call accounting systems earn a higher gross margin than the distributed pbx product line 
management believes the gross margins earned on lodging systems sales in fiscal are indicative of those expected to be earned in fiscal the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues in fiscal were compared to in fiscal ultimately  management believes that gross margins earned on installation and service revenues will be in the range of to as it continues to develop the commercial sales model and leverage its nation wide staff of technicians 
since the acquisitions of usti and act  the company has been continually working to improve both the revenues and margins earned by its installation and service activities 
specifically  the company has or is in the process of implementing the following initiatives first  the company is shifting the installation of commercial systems from a third party model to an in house model 
to do this  the company has continued throughout the year to scale up its technician capacity and expertise in installing commercial systems 
also  the company is implementing a new provisioning process designed to streamline commercial installations 
this initiative is largely complete although the company is continually evaluating its provisioning and logistics processes 
second  the company implemented new job costing and pricing tools  thereby improving its margins on services still outsourced to third parties 
management is also continuing to evaluate this costing tool to ensure that these margins continue to improve 
finally  as discussed above  the company has introduced a new commercial maintenance offering which management believes will provide a steady source of recurring revenues to offset the impact of fluctuations in installation activities and to cover the base of fixed costs 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses  including selling  general and administrative sga  engineering  research and development engineering  and amortization were of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total fiscal revenues 
sga costs represented of revenues in compared to in these levels were satisfactory to management given the rapid growth of the company and the complexity of its operations compared to a year ago 
however  management believes that sales expenses grew at a faster rate than necessary in the last half of fiscal due to lower sales productivity  primarily related to slowdowns in the lodging  government and pacific northwest segments of its business 
engineering costs represented of revenues in compared to in the company s engineering related costs have shifted dramatically in the last year to a more internal support function rather than a product focused research and support function 
given the company s growth and number of major locations  there is much greater need on supporting and integrating the company s technology infrastructure 
that focus will continue for the foreseeable future  and specifically in  the company intends to convert its existing variety of operating and accounting systems to one platform based on an oracle database 
amortization expense between the two years consists of different components and is therefore not comparable 
the majority of amortization expense in fiscal related to the amortization of the purchase price of the pbx service contracts purchased from williams communications solutions in late  while the majority of amortization expense recorded in fiscal is related to the acquisitions of usti and act 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on the company s credit facility that was used to fund the acquisitions discussed throughout this report  interest on a working capital revolver  and various commitment fees paid on the unused portion of the credit facility 
previous to the establishment of this credit facility  the company did not have any outstanding debt 
interest and other income 
interest and other income consists primarily of interest income earned on xetaplan sales type leases 
under these lease arrangements  the company provides a call accounting system to its lodging customers and service on the system for a period of three to five years in exchange for a monthly or quarterly fee 
under the accounting rules followed by the company  a portion of these payments are imputed as interest income 
in fiscal  interest income also included interest earned on cash investments 
the decline in interest income reflects the decline in available cash balances for investments 
income taxes 
the company recorded a provision for federal and state income taxes of million or of pre tax income compared to million or of pre tax income in fiscal this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
net income as a percent of sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal this lower operating margin reflects the company s transition from a niche company in the small hospitality sector to a voice and data integrator in a larger and faster growing commercial voice and data integration market 
given the current environment of this new market  with its trend toward convergence utilizing internet protocol  and the accompanying changes required by the distribution channels to participate in this new environment  management believes that quickly repositioning the company to take advantage of these two significant trends is a strategic priority 
the company has elected to be aggressive in its entry into this market and is implementing a balanced growth strategy  which includes acquisitions and internal growth 
in general  the lower operating margins were expected by management and reflect the additional interest and amortization expense the company has incurred to pursue this strategy 
in the near term  as management repositions the company to take advantage of these trends in the commercial market  management expects the company s after tax operating margins to range between and  with an expectation of the lower end of that range specifically in fiscal year ended october  compared to october  for the fiscal year ended october   the company reported record net income and revenues of million and million representing a increase in net income and a increase in total revenues compared to its fiscal year 
the increase in total revenues consisted of an increase in installation and service revenues of  an increase in sales of systems of  and a decrease in long distance revenues of 
by product line  fiscal revenues earned from communications systems or pbx s related activities  including sales of new systems  installations and service  increased million  or  revenues from call accounting related activities increased million or  and revenues from the company s long distance service offering declined  or 
all of the company s revenues during fiscal were earned from the lodging market 
sales of pbx systems increased million or while revenues earned from pbx installation and service activities increased million or in fiscal compared to the growth in revenues was attributable to the continued acceptance of the company s pbx product and service offering which included the introduction of the lucent guestworks r communications system  and the robust us economy which fueled continued new construction of hotels  significant remodeling projects and expansions of existing pbx systems to accommodate multiple phone line access in hotels 
while sales of hitachi systems still far outweighed sales of lucent products in  sales and installations of lucent systems increased steadily during the last half of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced a surge in orders for call accounting systems that resulted in an increase in revenues from systems sold of million or 
revenues from call accounting installation and service activities increased million or during fiscal this surge in orders was primarily due to the broad market acceptance of the company s virtual xl r call accounting system 
revenues from the company s long distance service offering declined  or due to an erosion in the usage of services used by guests and customer hotels 
gross margins earned on total revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues were unchanged in fiscal at compared to fiscal however  the company experienced pressure on the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues during fiscal and  and both years margins were lower than historical levels 
the gross margins earned on systems sales increased to from in fiscal compared to this increase was primarily due to the favorable mix of systems sales toward higher margin call accounting systems 
the gross margins earned on long distance services in fiscal were compared to in fiscal the gross margin earned on this revenue source during fiscal benefited from lower overall long distance revenues because the revenues were insufficient to trigger payments to the company s marketing alliance partner 
total operating expenses  including selling  general  and administrative sga  engineering  research and development engineering  and amortization increased million or in fiscal however  of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in amortization expense 
most of the increase in amortization was related to the company s purchase of pbx service contracts in september  for million  amortized over the average life of the contracts  which was approximately one year 
ignoring amortization expense  the costs of sga and engineering activities represented of revenues in fiscal and of fiscal revenues 
interest income was relatively unchanged between and the company earned interest income from its sale type lease contracts with customers and from cash investments 
interest income earned from additions to its sale type lease receivables was offset by decreases in interest income earned on cash balances due to lower average cash on hand in fiscal the company recorded a provision for federal and state income taxes of million or of pre tax income compared to million or in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate reflected an increase in the company s estimated multi state tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources as a result of the company s growth strategy and the related acquisitions made during the year  the capital structure of the company changed dramatically during fiscal concurrent with the acquisition of usti  the company established a million credit facility to fund that transaction and provide a committed line of credit for working capital needs and to fund additional transactions 
during the year  the company expanded the working capital portion of the facility from million to million  thereby bringing the total available under the facility to million 
borrowing under the acquisition portions of the facility is based on a multiple of ebitda  as defined in the facility  including ebitda of the target company 
the interest rate charged on borrowings is based on a margin above libor or prime  with the margin adjusted for specific ranges of leverage as determined by the company s debt ratio  as defined in the facility 
upon initiating the credit facility  the company borrowed million to finance the usti acquisition 
in february   the company borrowed an additional million to finance the acquisition of the assets of act 
as a result of these borrowings  less the effect of scheduled principal payments  the total debt related to acquisitions at october  was million 
an additional million was outstanding on the working capital portion of the facility 
on the day following the close of the fiscal year  the company borrowed an additional million to complete the purchases of the assets of pro networks and kmi 
currently  the company has approximately million remaining capacity under the acquisition portion of the facility 
management believes that it has sufficient access to debt and equity capital to pursue its growth strategy  including additional acquisitions 
its evaluation of potential acquisition candidates is ongoing 
these evaluations center on the target s cash flows  product and service mix  installation and service capabilities  and geographic reach 
the purchase of some targets under consideration or the cumulative effect of purchasing several targets could exceed the available remaining capacity under the current credit agreement 
the agreement currently in place was based upon the combined projected ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of xeta and usti 
therefore  the company s credit capacity  in the judgment of management  continues to increase as the company s earnings expand 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company will be evaluating its needs for additional bank financing with a view towards securing additional capacity 
while no assurances can be made  management believes that its current bank group is favorable towards expansion of the facility  however  at this time the company has chosen not to incur the expenses required to do so 
in addition to debt financing  the company believes that a wide variety of other capital resources are available including subordinated debt  secondary equity offerings  pooling of interests transactions  private placements of either debt or equity instruments  and combinations of all of the above 
during fiscal  cash balances decreased million 
sources of cash included cash earned from operations of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
uses of cash included investing activities of million 
in addition to the investments made in the acquisitions described above  the company invested million in additions to property and equipment to fund expansion of its employee base and technology infrastructure 
principal payments made on the debt during the year were million  all of which was made against the initial draw of million 
beginning december   the acquisition draws made to fund the act  pro networks  and kmi acquisitions were converted to a term loan in accordance with the agreement and the company will begin making principal payments accordingly 
outlook and risk factors the statements in this section entitled outlook and risk factors  as well as other statements throughout this report regarding trends or future performance or events  are based on management s current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
all such statements should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed herein and elsewhere in this report 
growth strategy and acquisitions 
fiscal represented the first year in the company s planned expansion beyond its traditional focus on the lodging market to become a nationwide integrator of voice and data technology serving the commercial market 
since the announcement of this strategy in june   the focus  size and capital structure of the company has changed dramatically as is discussed in other areas of this report 
these changes present a variety of risk factors to the company including the integration of the operations and employees of new acquisitions including possible problems with financial control and computer system compatibility  unanticipated costs  and loss of key employees  increased and significant demands on the company s administrative  operational  financial and management personnel  use of debt and possibly equity capital to finance the planned growth  and the successful management of a fast growing company with nation wide sales  service and administrative operations 
the failure to effectively manage these changes could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  or financial condition and upon the investment community s perception of the company s ability to carry out its growth strategy 
attracting and retaining talented employees 
as a result of changes in technology  the company s strategy to grow faster than the market rate  and the overall tight us labor market  the ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the company s success 
as the company continues to expand into the sales  installation  and maintenance of converged networks  the need for technicians with training certifications in the specific products and applications that the company is selling will be essential 
currently  the demand for these individuals is extremely high and very competitive and compensation for such individuals is rising much faster than general wages 
management believes that by providing opportunities for these individuals at the leading edge of this technology and through appropriate compensation and training programs  the company can attract and retain the needed competencies for its growth plans 
such compensation programs should be designed to provide both current income and long term equity based compensation 
should the disfavor of technology stocks that is currently prevalent in the stock market continue or should the company s operating performance result in disfavor of the company s stock in particular  then those equity based programs would likely not provide sufficient additional compensation to attract or retain key employees 
in those circumstances  it is likely that wages would have to be increased  thereby lowering the expected gross margins on installation and service revenues as well as overall operating margins 
a similar tension is occurring related to the hiring and retaining of qualified sales personnel 
in addition to attracting new account executives with the capability of prospecting for opportunities in the new  emerging applications and converged products  all of the company s existing account executives must undergo a personal transformation to learn these products 
the company is investing heavily in the training of its sales force and will continue to evaluate its sales compensation programs to help ensure a high retention rate for its account executives 
notwithstanding the company s efforts in these areas  no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in hiring  training and retaining the personnel needed to effectively execute its current business strategy 
dealer agreements 
the company sells communications systems under dealer agreements with avaya  inc formerly lucent technologies and hitachi telecom  usa  inc the company is a major dealer for both manufacturers and considers its relationship with both to be good 
nevertheless  if the company s strategic relationship with avaya  and to a lesser degree with hitachi  were to be terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  the company s operating results would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  in both the separate agreements that the company has with avaya for distribution of products to the commercial and lodging markets  respectively  and the agreement with hitachi  the company must meet certain volume commitments to earn the pricing structure provided in the dealer agreements 
in addition  the company s relationship with avaya is administered through a joint agreement between the company  avaya  and one of avaya s super distributors  voda one formerly inacom through which the company receives specified pricing from voda one based on certain volume requirements 
should the company fail to meet any of these requirements  future profit margins could suffer 
dependence upon the avaya business partner program and incentive programs 
as described above  the company has built a significant portion of its commercial business from its program to work avaya s nam s and gam s 
under this program  the company partners with avaya to design  sell  and install avaya equipment to large avaya customers under sales agreements negotiated by the nam or gam 
the company is typically engaged by avaya because it can meet the customer s need for fast delivery and installation 
currently  the avaya s nam s and gam s receive identical compensation from avaya regardless of whether their orders are fulfilled by avaya s direct installation team or by a dealer such as the company 
while no assurance can be given  if avaya were to alter their nam and gam compensation program to favor using avaya s direct provisioning and installation teams  the company would likely suffer material  adverse operating results 
also  avaya  like many major manufacturers  provides various incentive programs to support the advertising and sale of its products 
the company receives substantial rebates through these common incentive programs to offset both costs of goods sold and marketing expenses 
these rebates are based on a combination of the dollar volumes of purchases of certain products  the number of units of certain products purchased  and the year over year growth in purchases of certain products 
historically  the requirements of these incentive programs are changed annually 
while the company does not expect such programs to be altered to the company s detriment  there can be no assurance given that a change in these programs won t negatively impact the company s profit margins and operating results 
new market entrants 
earlier in the year  lucent technologies prior to the spinning off of its enterprise business  now called avaya  sold its small business division to expanets  a partner entity of northwest corporation 
as a result of the sale  expanets became the largest dealer of lucent avaya telecommunications products in the us  a position previously held by the company 
while the company and expanets primarily target different segments of the market  there is some overlap at the lower end of the enterprise market 
this increased competition from a significantly larger and financially stronger competitor could negatively impact the company s sales and gross margins 
competition 
although the market for voice and data technologies integrators is in its infancy  competition will be formidable and real 
the company will be competing with established telecommunications companies that have a larger or more well established commercial customer base  and with other technology companies that have existing voice and data integration competencies 
with regard to the traditional voice communications market  the competitive environment is also fierce 
as a distributor of telecommunications products for avaya and hitachi  the company competes not only with distributors that represent other manufacturers products  but also with other avaya and hitachi distributors 
avaya has approximately voice dealers nationwide and hitachi has more than distributors that the company competes against in the hospitality sector 
credit facility and reliance on debt financing 
the company s expansion into the commercial market segment through a strategy of acquisitions and aggressive internal growth has necessitated a dramatic change in the capital structure of the company 
to date  the company has funded this expansion through the use of bank debt 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is subject to various financial and operating covenants 
in fiscal  the company s capital expenditures exceeded the limit provided for in the credit facility 
the company has received a waiver of this covenant for fiscal while the company believes that it will operate within the covenants in the future  there can be no assurance given that the company s lenders would waive additional violations should they occur 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  management believes that the company can secure sufficient debt financing to support its planned growth strategy 
however  should such debt financing not be available from its current lenders  there can be no assurance given that an agreement with other banks could be secured or that other forms of capital  such as private or public placements of equity  would be available 
section h election 
the acquisition of usti was a purchase of of the stock of usti for financial reporting purposes 
however  for tax purposes  all of the parties to the purchase agreement agreed to elect under the applicable internal revenue code  to treat the transaction as a purchase of assets by the company 
to properly affect the appropriate elections for this desired tax treatment  the required election form was to be filed by august  since this election form has not been timely filed  the company is working with its professional advisors and the former usti shareholders in seeking administrative relief from the irs to accept the election form as if it had been timely filed 
based on historical precedent  it is probable that administrative relief will be granted by the irs 
however  there can be no guarantee of such an outcome 
failure to obtain administrative relief will result in a loss of significant tax deductions to the company over the next years and as a result  will increase the company s effective tax rate on its financial statements 
lodging industry 
as a result of less capital available to the lodging industry for new construction  remodeling and investments in new technology  the company has seen a return of longer sales cycles that had characterized the company s experience with the industry in recent years 
sec regulation fd and company guidance for future results 
during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal  a new sec regulation regarding fair disclosure of material company information became effective 
this regulation  commonly called reg 
fd  has significantly changed the methods by which public companies  including the company  interact with stock market analysts  shareholders  the media  and other interested parties 
in an effort to comply with reg 
fd  the company has released a press release and held an open conference call with the analysts who write financial research reports on the company to discuss management s expectations for fiscal this guidance provided a variety of information to help the analysts and other investors to form their own forecasts of results 
management expects to continue to update this guidance as fiscal unfolds 
however  although management believes that such guidance currently reflects and  when updated  will continue to reflect its then current expectations of future results  there can be no assurance given that the company s actual results will be consistent with the guidance given or with analysts forecasts of such results 
pending litigation 
the company is involved in several matters of pending litigation see legal proceedings under part i above 
no loss contingencies  other than the estimated costs of bringing one of the cases to trial  have been recorded in the financial statements 
should the outcome of either of these matters be unfavorable  however  the company may have to record expenses which might cause operating results to be materially lower than those expected 
general risk factors 
in addition to the specific factors discussed above  the following general factors can also impact the company s overall performance and results of operations the strength of the us economy  the continued growth of the ip networking market  uncertainties inherent with rapidly changing technologies and customer demand  and relationships with suppliers  vendors and customers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
the company s cash equivalents  which consist of highly liquid  short term investments with an average maturity of less than days  are subject to fluctuating interest rates 
a hypothetical percent change in such interest rates would not have a material effect upon the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows 
during fiscal year  the company entered into a million credit facility  with variable interest rates based on either libor or the bank s prime rate 
at october   the company had borrowings under the credit facility of million 
while the company is exposed to changes in interest rates risk  a hypothetical change in interest rates on its variable rate borrowings would not have a material effect on the company s earnings or cash flow
