item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the companies referred to herein are defined in note a  notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s actual capital expenditures for and and projected requirements through are detailed as follows millions of dollars cjo plant delaware systems renew program scheduled upgrades to existing systems total in  middlesex issued million of first mortgage bonds through the new jersey state revolving fund srf  which included funds for the renew program 
renew is our program to clean and cement line unlined mains in the middlesex system 
there is a total of approximately miles of unlined mains in the mile middlesex system 
we have applied for srf financing for the renew program 
if approved  first mortgage bonds would be issued in november the remaining financing of our capital program may be a combination of internal funds from middlesex  long term debt financing and common equity 
we will utilize our lines of credit until a balance is reached that can be cost effectively mortgaged on a long term basis 
there are million in total lines of credit available with two commercial banks 
at december   we had million of loans outstanding against those lines of credit 
to the extent possible  we will pursue long term debt on a tax exempt basis 
in the past  middlesex has offered temporary discounts to plan participants for optional cash payments and reinvested dividends under its dividend reinvestment plan 
this has proven to be an efficient mechanism to raise necessary equity without the need for a full and more expensive common stock offering 
we will certainly consider the discount in our financing plans 
the company currently has ten series of first mortgage bonds outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the first mortgage bonds have been issued under and secured by a mortgage indenture and supplements thereto  which constitute a direct first mortgage lien upon substantially all of the property of middlesex 
tidewater  a wholly owned subsidiary  borrowed funds under a million  amortizing secured note due december  approximately million was outstanding under that note as of december  management s discussion and analysis results of operations compared to operating revenues were up million  which amounts to over unusually mild and wet summer weather in new jersey and delaware caused system wide demand to be below average consumption 
new jersey revenue growth of million  due to rate increases  was offset by lower consumption revenue of million 
our delaware customer base grew by to  which was the primary reason for the million increase in revenues in that system 
a significant portion of the customer growth represents the acquisition of twelve mobile home park water systems 
the small net rate increase granted by the delaware public service commission was negated by the below average customer consumption 
in an amended base rate filing  tidewater had requested a rate increase 
revenues from operating the city of perth amboy s water and wastewater systems fell million  also due mostly to unusual weather patterns 
total operating expenses rose almost or million over under operations expenses  the cost of water treatment grew by million  employee labor and benefits rose million  uncollectible accounts written off rose million and legal and other outside services increased by million 
in total  purchased water and power fell million due to lower production 
the decline of less than million in maintenance expenses would have been greater except for a large number of unanticipated repairs to the recently acquired mobile home park water systems in delaware 
depreciation expense jumped or million 
in addition to the increase to utility plant of million during the year  also included is a full year of depreciation on the million upgrade to the carl j 
olsen water treatment plant cjo plant 
other income s decrease of million represents the net financing activities associated with the cjo plant construction program reported in allowance for funds used during construction afudc dropped million  while interest income on excess cash fell by million 
the increase in total interest charges of million represents a full year impact of the first mortgage bonds issued during  plus an increase in short term bank borrowings of million 
net income fell to million 
although we expected that replicating results would be a challenge  clearly  three factors made that earnings level untenable in unusually mild summer weather in new jersey and delaware caused system wide production to drop by or billion gallons 
inadequate rate relief in delaware reduced expected revenues by million 
also in delaware  unanticipated higher operating costs for labor  purchased water  water treatment  customer service and maintenance reduced profitability 
results of operations compared to operating revenues were up million or over this significant increase was attributable to several factors 
usa pa began providing services under its year management contract with the city of perth amboy  which accounted for million of the increased revenues 
rate increases for all our regulated companies amounted to million in additional revenues 
customer growth in our delaware service territory contributed million 
drought related consumption decreases in new jersey and a one time refund to a large industrial user offset some of the current year increases in the amount of million 
record water usage in new jersey during july and early august was completely offset by the statewide drought restrictions imposed by the governor of new jersey on august  generally  these restrictions were subsequently lifted on september  at all times  middlesex had adequate sources of water to supply its customers 
this fact  along with the company s objection to such a broad water restriction was communicated to state authorities 
the company is continuing its effort to change the state procedures for drought emergency declarations 
total operating expenses also rose significantly over last year 
the increase over was million or 
operations and maintenance costs associated with the services provided to the city of perth amboy accounted for million 
purchased water costs were up million  while purchased power increased million 
water treatment costs rose million 
increased staffing levels pushed labor and benefits up by million 
an unusual number of emergency repairs  both in terms of quantity and severity  increased maintenance by million 
depreciation expense jumped or million 
the mid year activation of the improvements to the cjo plant increased depreciable property by over million 
other taxes rose million due mostly to revenue related taxes 
the increase in federal income taxes was million or 
deferred taxes on construction related activities tempered the effect of the current tax expense 
other income s slight increase of million represents the net financing activities associated with the cjo plant construction program 
afudc increased by million while interest income on excess cash fell by million 
the increase in total interest charges of million represents a full year impact of the three series of first mortgage bonds issued during net income reached another record high by increasing million or 
even with an increase of more than ten percent shares outstanding  due to the million shares issued in december  earnings per share also reached record territory again 
basic earnings per share rose to 
regulatory matters three base rate increase petitions were filed with the new jersey board of public utilities bpu 
pinelands pinelands middlesex water wastewater date filed june  july  july  amount million million million increase return on equity last increase may  january  january  the requested increases are necessary to cover higher operations and maintenance costs  depreciation and taxes 
in addition  continued significant plant investment in the middlesex system also contributed to the rate request 
the last rate increase for the pinelands companies represented the final stage of a three phase implementation 
the first increase was effective january  the discovery phase and the evidentiary hearings have been completed for all cases 
legal briefs have been filed for all three cases 
the administrative law judge assigned to the middlesex cased issued an oral decision on march  recommending an or million increase 
initial decisions for the pinelands cases are not expected until mid april ultimate resolution by the bpu for the three cases are not expected until the middle of the second quarter of on september   tidewater and public jointly filed a petition with the delaware public service commission psc for a base rate increase of million or 
the increase is necessary to cover additional capital improvements and increased operating and maintenance costs 
as prescribed by psc regulations  tidewater was granted an interim rate increase  subject to refund  of  effective november  concurrently with the rate increase request  an application was filed and approved by the psc for a corporate merger of tidewater and public 
public merged into tidewater effective february  the last increase in base rates for tidewater and public were in and  respectively 
on march   tidewater amended its base rate increase petition from to 
the lower request was due mostly to lower than projected capital expenditures 
evidentiary hearings were held in mid april the hearing examiner issued his report in late june  which recommended an increase of approximately 
this matter was brought before the psc on september   at which time the company was granted a rate increase 
the psc disallowed any recognition of acquisition adjustments and applied a credit against the allowed return of equity of due to quality of service issues 
this credit may be removed by the psc upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that tidewater has resolved the quality issues that arose during the course of the rate proceedings 
because tidewater implemented a interim rate increase on november   refunds were given to its customers  along with interest  by way of billing credits  for the difference between interim and approved rates  retroactive to the date interim rates were put into effect 
in may  the bpu approved an or million base rate increase for middlesex 
under the approval  the allowed return on equity is with an overall rate of return of 
the purpose of the increase is to allow middlesex the opportunity to earn a return on and recover the capital investment in the upgrade and expansion of the cjo plant 
this project was necessary to meet the new and anticipated regulatory standards concerning water quality and to increase the plant s production capacity 
the company s original rate request  which was filed in september  was for million 
on january   usa pa began operating the city of perth amboy s water and wastewater systems under a year agreement 
perth amboy has a population of  and has approximately  water and wastewater customers 
the agreement is being effected under new jersey s water supply public private contracting act and the new jersey wastewater public private contracting act 
under the agreement  usa pa receives a fixed fee and a variable fee based on increased system billing 
fixed fee payments began at million in the first year and will increase to million in year the agreement also requires usa pa to lease from perth amboy all of its employees who currently work on the perth amboy water and wastewater systems 
in connection with the agreement  perth amboy  through the middlesex county improvement authority  issued approximately million in three series of bonds on january  the company guaranteed one of those series of bonds  in the principal amount of approximately million 
perth amboy guaranteed the two other series of bonds 
in addition to the agreement with perth amboy  usa pa simultaneously entered into a year subcontract with a sewer contracting firm for the operation and maintenance of the perth amboy wastewater system 
the subcontract requires the sharing of certain fixed and variable fees and operating expenses 
in december  middlesex closed on a franchise agreement with the city of south amboy south amboy to provide water service and install water system facilities in south amboy 
the agreement between middlesex and south amboy  originally signed in december  received approval from the bpu on november  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
the adoption of this statement on january   had no impact on the financial statements 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long term debt and  to a lesser extent  short term debt 
the company s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate  long term debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our first mortgage bonds  which have maturity dates ranging from to over the next twelve months  approximately million of the current portion of three existing long term debt instruments will mature 
combining this amount with the million in short term debt outstanding at december   and applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by on those borrowings  would not have a material effect on earnings 
outlook revenues are expected to continue to grow in anticipated customer growth in delaware and tidewater s ability to have the equity credit removed by the psc should enhance earnings 
the company continues to explore viable plans to streamline operations and reduce costs  particularly in delaware where customer growth continues to exceed industry averages 
part of the challenge is that our delaware operations are a combination of over stand alone production and distribution systems serving communities 
the level of earnings will be impacted by the ultimate outcome of the new jersey base rate cases currently under review by the bpu 
earnings from non regulated operations are expected to remain constant 
as evident in  revenues and  therefore  earnings in may also be affected by weather conditions 
our strategy is for continued growth through acquisitions  internal expansion  public private partnerships and rate relief 
opportunities in both the regulated and non regulated sectors that are financially sound  complement existing operations and increase shareholder value will be pursued 
we are currently pursuing opportunities in new jersey and delaware  which could significantly increase our customer base
