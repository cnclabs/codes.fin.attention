the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
on june   the company paid a dividend of per share to shareholders of record as of june  the company does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation 
discontinued operations during  the company divested its bendata and abalon subsidiaries 
the closing of the bendata sale was effective as of july   and the closing of the abalon sale was effective december  through bendata  the company had offered the heat family of software applications for the internal help desk automation market 
heat is a trademark of bendata  inc through abalon  the company had offered the abalon suite of sales and marketing applications built around a central customer database 
the company s management concluded that these past acquisitions did not contribute synergistically to a strong market focus 
additionally  astea could not provide adequate investment across multiple products and markets to establish or maintain strong market positions  while supporting the aggressive investment necessary to maintain or improve its core market position 
to better ensure long term success  the company elected to maintain a clear and distinct market focus on field service and support  which leverages its inherent industry expertise and knowledge 
the bendata and abalon operations have been treated as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the operating results and assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reflected separately from continuing operations 
during  the company recorded a gain on the sale of bendata of  net of taxes of  and a gain on the sale of abalon of  including a tax benefit of  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the discontinued operations generated revenues of  the discontinued operations generated a net loss of  in certain factors that may affect future results the company does not provide forecasts of its future financial performance 
from time to time  however  information provided by the company or statements made by its employees may contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical fact may constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and may in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the risks  uncertainties and other information discussed within this annual report on form k  as well as the accuracy of the company s internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
the following discussion of the company s risk factors should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto set forth elsewhere in this report 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this report and presented by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions uncertain market acceptance of servicealliance  decreased revenues from dispatch in each of   and  more than   and  respectively  of the company s total revenues was derived from the licensing of dispatch and the provision of professional services in connection with the implementation  deployment and maintenance of dispatch installations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company originally introduced servicealliance in august in order to target a market segment in which dispatch was not cost effective or attractive 
subsequent  rapid changes in technology have now positioned servicealliance to supercede dispatch as the company s flagship brand 
as a result  the probability that dispatch will be sold to new customers is small 
sales to existing customers comprised of dispatch license revenue in dispatch revenues have declined in each of the last three fiscal years and that trend is expected to continue and accelerate 
while the company has licensed servicealliance to over companies worldwide in through  revenues from sales of servicealliance alone are not yet sufficient to support the expenses of the company 
the company s future success will depend mainly on its ability to increase licenses of servicealliance and other offerings  on developing new products and product enhancements to complement its existing field service and customer support offerings  on its ability to continue support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  and on its ability to reduce its operating expenses 
any failure of the company s products to achieve or sustain market acceptance  or of the company to sustain its current position in the field service software market  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase demand for servicealliance  obtain an acceptable level of support and maintenance revenues from dispatch  or to lower its expenses  thereby avoiding future losses 
need for development of new products 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products  including its planned ecrm products  on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments  industry standards and the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers  including developments within the client server and object oriented computing environments 
such developments may require  from time to time  substantial capital investments by the company in product development and testing 
the company intends to continue its commitment to research and development and its efforts to develop new products and product enhancements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products and product enhancements  that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
furthermore  reallocation of resources by the company  such as the diversion of research and development personnel to development of a particular feature for a potential or existing customer  can delay new products and certain product enhancements 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce new products or enhancements of existing products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely effected 
competition in the customer relationship management software market is intense 
the crm software market is intensely competitive 
the company s competitors include large public companies primarily providing crm solutions such as oracle  peoplesoft and siebel  as well as traditional enterprise resource planning software providers such as sap  that are developing field service and customer support capabilities 
in addition  a number of smaller  privately held companies generally focus only on discrete areas of the crm software marketplace 
because the barriers to entry in the crm software market are relatively low  new competitors may emerge with products that are superior to the company s products or that achieve greater market acceptance 
some of the company s existing and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than the company has 
moreover  the crm industry is currently experiencing significant consolidation  as larger public companies seek to enter the crm market through acquisitions 
the company expects that competition will increase as a result of software industry consolidations 
as a result  some of the company s competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development and distribution of their products 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not adversely affect its business and results of operations 
continued dependence on large contracts may result in lengthy sales and implementation cycles 
the sale and implementation of the company s products generally involve a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
while servicealliance requires a less substantial commitment than does dispatch  the purchase and implementation of servicealliance still requires a substantial commitment 
as a result  the company s sales process often is subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes attendant to significant capital expenditures  definition of special customer implementation requirements  and extensive contract negotiations with the customer 
the sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer and typically lasts between four and nine months 
during this time the company may devote significant time and resources to a prospective customer  including costs associated with multiple site visits  product demonstrations and feasibility studies 
the company may experience a number of significant delays over which the company has no control 
because the costs associated with the sale of the product are fixed in current periods  timing differences between incurring costs and recognition of revenue associated with a particular project may result 
moreover  in the event of any downturn in any existing or potential customer s business or the economy in general  purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled 
in addition  following the initial sale  the implementation of our products typically involves several months of customer training and integration of the product with the customer s other existing systems 
a successful implementation requires a close working relationship between the customer and members of the company s professional service organization 
occasionally  delays result from a customer s lack of attention to the implementation project for reasons unrelated to the company s performance 
when the company has provided consulting services to implement certain larger projects  some customers have in the past delayed payment of a portion of license fees until implementation was complete and in some cases have disputed the consulting fees charged for implementation 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
some of the company s customers have adopted the company s software on an incremental basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s customers will expand usage of the company s software on an enterprise wide basis or implement new software products introduced by the company 
the failure of the company s software to perform according to customer expectations or otherwise to be deployed on an enterprise wide basis could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to collect revenues or to increase revenues from new as well as existing customers 
the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
reduced product offerings after sales of bendata and abalon 
during  the company divested its bendata and abalon subsidiaries 
through bendata  the company had offered the heat family of software applications for the help desk automation market 
through abalon  the company had offered the abalon suite of sales and marketing applications built around a central customer database 
through these strategic dispositions  the company has refocused its efforts and resources on the field service and customer support segment of the crm software market  which is the company s core competency 
while the company s current products offer help desk and sales automation functionality  the company currently does not offer stand alone products in the help desk and sales and marketing automation segments of the crm software market 
as a result  the company s product lines are now less diversified than when the abalon and heat products were offered 
this could impede the company s ability to compete against other companies in the crm software market that offer a wider range of products and further increases the company s reliance on dispatch and servicealliance 
any failure of the company s remaining products to achieve or sustain market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results may be significant 
the company s quarterly operating results have in the past varied significantly and are likely to vary significantly in the future  depending on factors such as the size and timing of revenue from significant orders  the recognition of revenue from such orders  the timing of new product releases and market acceptance of these new releases  the level of product and price competition  and the seasonality of its business 
as a result of the application of the revenue recognition rules applicable to the company s licenses under generally accepted accounting principles  the company s license revenues may be recognized in periods after those in which the respective licenses were signed 
in addition  the company s quarterly operating results are dependent on factors such as budgeting cycles of its customers  customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  the impact of acquisitions of competitors  the cancellation of licenses or maintenance agreements  product life cycles  software bugs and other product quality problems  personnel changes  changes in company strategy  investments to develop sales distribution channels  changes in the level of operating expenses and general domestic and international economic and political conditions  among others 
the company has generally had stronger demand for its products during the quarters ending in june and december and weaker demand in the quarter ending in march 
the company anticipates that it may also experience relatively weaker demand in the quarter ending in september 
moreover  the company has generally recorded most of its total quarterly license revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of license revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
thus  the company s results of operations may vary seasonally in accordance with licensing activity or otherwise  and will also depend upon its recognition of revenue from such licenses from time to time 
there can be no assurance that the company will be profitable or avoid losses in any future period  and the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
rapid technological change 
the crm software market is subject to rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving technologies and industry standards that can quickly render existing products and services obsolete 
while the company is not aware of any emerging products that are likely to render its existing products obsolete  there can be no assurance that the company s products could not suffer such obsolescence 
because of the rapid pace of technological change in the application software industry  the company s current market position in field service and customer support automation or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by product advancements 
the company s application environment relies primarily on software development tools from progress software corporation  in the case of dispatch  and microsoft corporation and powersoft corporation  a subsidiary of sybase  inc  in the case of servicealliance 
if alternative software development tools were to be designed and generally accepted by the marketplace  the company could be at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies employing such alternative developmental tools  possibly resulting in material harm to the company s financial condition and results of operation 
need to expand indirect sales 
the company has historically sold its products through its direct sales force and a limited number of distributors 
the company s ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on its success in establishing relationships with distributors  resellers and systems integrators 
the company is currently investing  and plans to continue to invest  significant resources to expand its domestic and international direct sales force and develop distribution relationships with certain third party distributors  resellers and systems integrators 
the company s distributors also sell or can potentially sell products offered by the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of its existing or future third party distribution partners or that such partners will recommend  or continue to recommend  the company s products 
the inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors  resellers or systems integrators could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
any failure by the company to maintain and train its direct sales force and expand other distribution channels would materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with international sales 
astea s international sales accounted for of the company s revenues in  in  and in the company expects that international sales will continue to be a significant component of its business 
international sales are subject to a variety of significant risks  including difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels and in translating products into foreign languages 
international operations also may encounter difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  staffing and managing personnel and enforcing intellectual property rights 
other factors that can also adversely affect international operations include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  changes in import export duties and quotas  introduction of tariff or non tariff barriers  potentially adverse tax consequences  possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  changes in the market for business software as a result of currency unification in europe  and economic or political changes in international markets 
the current economic difficulties in several asian countries could have an adverse impact on the company s international operations in future periods 
in addition  the company s international revenues may also be affected to a great extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower sales that typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
dependence on key personnel  competition for employees 
the future success of the company will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain talented and qualified employees  including skilled management personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for key personnel is intense  particularly so in recent years 
from time to time the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining talented and qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that the company can retain its key technical  sales and managerial employees or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel in the future 
the inability of the company to hire talented personnel or the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
concentration of ownership 
zack b 
bergreen  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board  as of march   beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
as a result  mr 
bergreen exercises significant control over the company through his ability to influence and control the election of directors and all other matters that require action by the company s stockholders 
under certain circumstances  mr 
bergreen could prevent or delay a change of control of the company which may be favored by a significant portion of the company s other stockholders  or cause a change of control not favored by the majority of the company s other stockholders 
mr 
bergreen s ability under certain circumstances to influence  cause or delay a change in control of the company also may have an adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
risks of dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
the company s products are licensed to customers under signed license agreements containing  among other terms  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights in its products and technology 
policing unauthorized use of the company s software is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that measures taken by the company will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary technology or that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
moreover  although the company believes that its products and technologies do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  and although there are no pending lawsuits against the company regarding infringement of any existing patents or other intellectual property rights or any notices that the company is infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such infringement claims will not be asserted by third parties in the future 
any such situations can have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
risk of product defects  failure to meet performance criteria 
the company s field service and customer support software is intended for use in enterprise wide applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  the company s customers and potential customers typically have demanding requirements for installation and deployment 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors or failures  particularly when software must be customized for a particular licensee  when new products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
although the company conducts extensive product testing during product development  the company has at times delayed commercial release of software until problems were corrected and  in some cases  has provided enhancements to correct errors in released software 
the company could  in the future  lose revenues as a result of software errors or defects 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in software  customizations or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss or delay of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
burdens of customization 
certain of the company s clients request customization of dispatch or servicealliance products to address unique characteristics of their businesses or computing environments 
the company s commitment to customization could place a burden on the company s client support resources or delay the delivery or installation of products which  in turn  could materially adversely affect the company s relationship with significant clients or otherwise adversely affect its business and results of operations 
in addition  the company could incur penalties or reductions in revenues for failures to develop or timely deliver new products or product enhancements under development agreements and other arrangements with customers 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the common stock has in the past been  and may continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations in response to  and may be adversely affected by  variations in quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  developments in the software industry  adverse earnings or other financial announcements of the company s customers and general stock market conditions as well as other factors 
in addition  the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from time to time which may bear no meaningful relationship to the company s performance
