results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
total revenues in increased to million from million in our financial consulting division s revenues grew by to million from million  or on a pro forma basis to million from million including the p m acquisition 
litigation consulting division revenues increased to million in from million in primarily through increased rates 
litigation consulting division revenues and productivity in the third and fourth quarters of were less than the comparable periods in due to seasonal variations in trial activity and an unusual number of trials that were deferred or cancelled due to settlement or settlement discussions 
our applied sciences division experienced in revenue growth in to million from million in total revenues in increased over litigation consulting revenues increased from to as a result of an improved volume of cases 
our applied sciences division experienced growth in  with nearly all of that growth coming from the acquisition of sea 
the financial consulting division s revenues grew by  with substantially all of that growth coming from the kci acquisition 
direct cost of revenues 
direct cost of revenues was of our total revenues in  in and in the improvement in resulted primarily from the acquisition of p m and productivity improvements in the financial consulting and applied sciences divisions  and was net of decreased productivity in litigation consulting as noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of our total revenues  these expenses were in  in and in the decrease in was primarily attributed to the acquisition of p m and the growth of the financial consulting division which has a lower ratio of selling  general and administrative expenses to revenues than the litigation consulting and applied sciences divisions 
amortization of goodwill 
annual amortization of goodwill increased from million in to million in  as a result of our acquisitions 
we discuss goodwill amortization further in future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill below 
other income and expenses 
interest expense consisted primarily of interest on debt we incurred to purchase the businesses referred to above 
interest expense increased substantially in as a result of the p m acquisition  and was then reduced by our subsequent equity offering and refinancing of existing debt in late income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in  and in  principally as a reduced effect of some of the goodwill amortization not being deductible for income tax purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax rates during each of these years  and a summary of the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
extraordinary item  net of taxes 
as a result of the write off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the debt that we refinanced on february  and repaid and refinanced in the fourth quarter of  we had a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes 
future assessment of recoverability and impairment of goodwill in connection with our various acquisitions  including p m  we recorded goodwill  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over periods of to years 
these are the periods during which we estimate we will benefit from this goodwill 
at december   unamortized goodwill was million  or of our total assets and of our stockholders equity 
goodwill arises when an acquirer pays more for a business than the fair value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets 
for financial reporting purposes  goodwill and all other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated period benefited 
we have determined the period for amortizing goodwill based upon several factors  the most significant of which are the relative size  historical financial viability  growth trends of the acquired companies and the relative lengths of time these companies have been in existence 
our management periodically reviews the carrying value and recoverability of our unamortized goodwill 
if the facts and circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired  we would adjust the carrying value of the goodwill 
this would result in an immediate charge against income during the period of the adjustment and or a shortening of the length of the remaining amortization period  which would result in an increase in the amount of goodwill amortization during the period of adjustment and each period thereafter until fully amortized 
if we adjust goodwill  we cannot assure you that we will not have to make further adjustments for impairment and recoverability in future periods 
the most significant of the factors we will consider in determining whether goodwill is impaired will be losses from operations  loss of customers  and industry developments such as our inability to maintain market share  the development of competitive products or services or imposition of additional regulatory requirements 
liquidity and capital resources in  we generated million of cash flow in our operations  compared to million in we attribute this dramatic increase in cash flow primarily to the significant increase in net income prior to the extraordinary item of million before taxes  plus non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and a portion of our interest expense 
cash flow from operations is also net of a million increase in our net working capital balances 
in  we generated million of cash flow from operations  an improvement of million from we attribute this increase to our higher net income excluding non cash charges principally depreciation and amortization of million and the favorable net cash effects of changes in working capital balances 
during the year ended december   we spent million for additions to property and equipment 
this amount included expenditures for internal information systems that allow us to better manage our expanding operations 
at december   we had no material commitments for the acquisition of property and equipment 
during  we spent million for additions to property and equipment 
to finance the p m acquisition in february  we entered into 
a senior credit facility  consisting of a million amortizing term loan maturing through january   initially bearing interest at libor plus specified margins ranging from to  which would decline based on our leverage ratio  
a million revolving credit facility not initially drawn down  bearing interest at prime plus  which also would decline based on our leverage ratio  and 
million of senior subordinated notes maturing january   bearing annual cash interest and annual interest payable in kind pik 
we used the proceeds of these facilities  together with approximately million of our existing cash  to purchase p m and to refinance our then existing debt of approximately million as follows 
in  we had borrowed million under our prior million long term credit facility with a bank to provide the million of cash needed to acquire kk a  kci and sea 
we negotiated this credit facility in march and repaid it on february  
in march  we issued million of subordinated debentures  that we also repaid on february  
when we acquired several businesses owned by several members of our current management team  we issued seller notes to them that totaled million on february  on february   we issued  shares of our common stock to retire million of the notes and repaid the remaining million in cash 
in connection with the senior subordinated notes issued in connection with the p m acquisition  we issued the holders warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire ten years from the date of closing 
we also retired warrants for  shares of our common stock issued in march in connection with the subordinated debt of million noted above that was repaid 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed a public offering of million shares of common stock 
we used the net proceeds and our other financial resources to repay the million senior subordinated notes that we issued on february  when we repaid the senior subordinated notes  we retired warrants for  shares of our common stock issued in february in connection with the million senior subordinated notes that were repaid 
in december  we refinanced our million term loan and the million revolving credit facility 
our new credit facility consists of an amortizing term loan of million and a million revolving credit line  of which million was drawn at december  the new credit facility bears interest at libor plus  which would decline based on our leverage ratio 
the new credit facility is secured by all of our assets 
under the new credit facility  we are required to comply with various specified financial covenants related to our operating performance at the end of each quarter  and the payment of dividends is restricted 
further  we have obtained interest rate protection  through interest rate swap  on the million term loan 
we believe we will be in compliance with all loan covenants throughout effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which the company is required to adopt effective january because of the company s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will not have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
forward looking statements some of the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements not to be fully achieved 
these forward looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expects  plans  intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential or continue or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
moreover  neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of such statements 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this annual report to conform such statements to actual results and do not intend to do so 
factors which may cause the actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from intended or expected results include  but are not limited to the loss of any key employees because the company s business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor intensive  the availability and terms of additional capital or debt financing to fund future acquisitions and for working capital purposes  significant competition for business opportunities and acquisition candidates  technological changes affecting our litigation consulting division  the risks of professional liability  any factor that diminishes our professional reputation  fluctuations of revenue and operating income between quarters or termination of client engagements  the successful management of the growth of our business  the integration of p m and of future acquisitions  and risks associated with quantitative and qualitative market risks such as fluctuations in interest rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company had million in long term debt 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of long term debt was hedged with interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate at  plus variable percentages  currently  as determined by the credit agreement 
therefore  at december   the remaining million of the company s long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
the company s earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings and assuming a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates under the company s long term bank credit facility for one year  the company s interest expense would increase by approximately  and net income would decrease by approximately  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
