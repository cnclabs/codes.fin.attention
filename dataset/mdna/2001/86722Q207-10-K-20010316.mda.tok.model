item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we were incorporated in october in february  we entered into a joint venture with at t wireless 
as part of the agreement  at t wireless contributed to us personal communications services licenses covering mhz of authorized frequencies in a contiguous geographic area encompassing portions of virginia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia and kentucky in exchange for an equity position in triton 
as part of the transaction  we were granted the right to be the exclusive provider of wireless mobility services using equal emphasis co branding with at t within our region 
on june   we acquired an existing cellular system serving myrtle beach and the surrounding area from vanguard cellular systems of south carolina  inc in connection with this acquisition  we began commercial operations and earning recurring revenue in july we integrated the myrtle beach system into our personal communications services network as part of our phase i network deployment 
substantially all of our revenues prior to were generated by cellular services provided in myrtle beach 
our results of operations do not include the myrtle beach system prior to our acquisition of that system 
we began generating revenues from the sale of personal communications services in the first quarter of as part of phase i of our personal communications services network build out 
our network build out is scheduled for three phases 
we completed the first phase of our build out in the first half of with the launch of markets and completed the second phase during the first quarter of launching additional markets 
we are in the third phase of our network build out  which focuses on covering major highways linking the cities in our licensed area  as well as neighboring cities where at t wireless and other carriers use compatible wireless technology 
this phase  which is expected to be completed by year end  has included the launch of one additional market in our licensed area 
revenue we derive our revenue from the following sources 
service 
we sell wireless personal communications services 
the various types of service revenue associated with wireless communications services for our subscribers include monthly recurring charges and monthly non recurring airtime charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime used in excess of pre subscribed usage 
our customers roaming charges are rate plan dependent and based on the number of pooled minutes included in their plans 
service revenue also includes monthly non recurring airtime usage charges associated with our prepaid subscribers and non recurring activation and de activation service charges 

equipment 
we sell wireless personal communications handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services 

roaming 
we charge per minute fees to other wireless telecommunications companies for their customers use of our network facilities to place and receive wireless services 
we believe our roaming revenues will be subject to seasonality 
we expect to derive increased revenues from roaming during vacation periods  reflecting the large number of tourists visiting resorts in our coverage area 
we believe that our equipment revenues will also be seasonal  as we expect sales of telephones to peak in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of increased sales during the holiday season 
although we expect our overall revenues to increase due to increasing roaming minutes  our per minute roaming revenue will decrease over time according to the terms of our agreements with at t wireless 
costs and expenses our costs of services and equipment include 
equipment 
we purchase personal communications services handsets and accessories from third party vendors to resell to our customers for use in connection with our services 
because we subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the use of our services  the cost of handsets is higher than the resale price to the customer 
we do not manufacture any of this equipment 

roaming fees 
we incur fees to other wireless communications companies based on airtime usage by our customers on other wireless communications networks 

transport and variable interconnect 
we incur charges associated with interconnection with other wireline and wireless carriers networks 
these fees include monthly connection costs and other fees based on minutes of use by our customers 

variable long distance 
we pay usage charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers 
these variable charges are based on our subscribers usage  applied at pre negotiated rates with the other carriers 

cell site costs 
we incur expenses for the rent of towers  network facilities  engineering operations  field technicians  and related utility and maintenance charges 
recent industry data indicate that transport  interconnect  roaming and long distance charges that we currently incur will continue to decline  due principally to competitive pressures and new technologies 
cell site costs are expected to increase due to escalation factors included in the lease agreements 
other expenses include 
selling and marketing 
our selling and marketing expense includes the cost of brand management  external communications  retail distribution  sales training  direct  indirect  third party and telemarketing support 

general and administrative 
our general and administrative expense includes customer care  billing  information technology  finance  accounting  legal services  network implementation  product development  and engineering management 
functions such as customer care  billing  finance  accounting and legal services are likely to remain centralized in order to achieve economies of scale 

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method  generally over three to twelve years  based upon estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease 
network development costs incurred to ready our network for use are capitalized 
amortization of network development costs begins when the network equipment is ready for its intended use and is amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
our personal communications services licenses and our cellular license are being amortized over a period of years 

non cash compensation 
as of december   we recorded million of deferred compensation associated with the issuances of our common and preferred stock to employees 
the compensation is being recognized over five years as the stock vests 

interest income expense and other 
interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense through december  consists of interest on our credit facility and notes  net of capitalized interest 
other expenses include amortization of certain financing charges 
our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to manage our variable costs  including selling  general and administrative expense  costs per gross added subscriber and costs of building out our network 
we expect our operating costs to grow as our operations expand and our customer base and call volumes increase 
over time  these expenses should represent a reduced percentage of revenues as our customer base grows 
management will focus on application of systems and procedures to reduce billing expense and improve subscriber communication 
these systems and procedures will include debit billing  credit card billing  over the air payment and internet billing systems 
investment in lafayette communications we own a equity investment in lafayette communications llc  which through separate transactions has agreed to acquire licenses in btas throughout the company s service area 
because we do not control lafayette communications  we account for our investment on the equity method and record our proportionate share of its losses or income in our income statement 
we anticipate that we will lend lafayette communications approximately million to finance the purchases of the licenses 
we will record as income any interest due from lafayette communications under its loan 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscribers were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in subscribers was primarily due to offering twelve months of service in the markets launched as of december  as part of our phase i and phase ii build out  launching additional markets between december  and december  as part of the phase ii and phase iii network build out  and continued strong demand for our digital service offerings and pricing plans 
the wireless industry typically generates a higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the other quarters 
this is due to the use of retail distribution  which is dependent on the holiday shopping season  the timing of new products and service introductions  and aggressive marketing and sales promotions

ebitda represents operating loss plus depreciation and amortization expense and non cash compensation 
we believe ebitda provides meaningful additional information on our operating results and on our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations as well as our ability to fund our continued growth 
ebitda is considered by many financial analysts to be a meaningful indicator of an entity s ability to meet its future financial obligations 
growth in ebitda is considered to be an indicator of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as wireless telecommunications 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with united states gaap  as an alternate to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with united states gaap  or as a measure of liquidity

liquidity and capital resources the construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of wireless communications products and services have required  and will continue to require  substantial capital 
these capital requirements include license acquisition costs  capital expenditures for network construction  funding of operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs  debt service and financing fees and expenses 
we estimate that our total capital requirements  assuming substantial completion of our network build out  which will allow us to offer services to nearly of the potential customers in our licensed area  and including loans to lafayette communications  from our inception until december  will be approximately billion  of which million had not yet been spent as of december  however  these capital requirements do not include any additional capital requirements that may result from future upgrades for advances in new technology  including with respect to advanced wireless data services 
we believe that cash on hand and available credit facility borrowings will be sufficient to meet our projected capital requirements through the completion of our network build out plan  including loans to lafayette communications 
although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient to build out our network and to enable us to offer services to nearly of the potential customers in our licensed area  it is possible that additional funding will be necessary

 revenue recognition  in the fourth quarter of as a result of its adoption  triton defers activation revenue and associated incremental direct costs over the estimated life of the subscriber 
the adoption of sab had no impact on prior reported results 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk therefore is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   the debt can be categorized as follows dollars in thousands fixed interest rates senior subordinated notes  subject to interest rate fluctuations bank credit facility  our interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt and minimizing liquidity risk 
to the extent possible  we manage interest rate exposure and the floating to fixed ratio through triton pcs s borrowings  but sometimes we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our risk profile 
we selectively enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure only 
we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our senior debt portfolio 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
swap counterparties are major commercial banks 
through december   we had entered into six interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate non amortizing notional amount of million 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
a basis point fluctuation in market rates would not have a material effect on our overall financial condition 
information  as of december   for the interest rate swaps entered into as follows fixed variable receivable term notional rate rate payable fair value the variable rate is capped at for the interest rate swaps  with notional amounts of million  million  million and million  respectively 
the swaps with notional amounts of million and million can be terminated at the bank s option in december our cash and cash equivalents consist of short term assets having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material relative to our overall investment income position
