the claims against the bank are based upon theories of breach of fiduciary duty  negligence  breach of contract  unjust enrichment  conversion  failure to act in a commercially reasonable manner  and constructive fraud

additionally  the bank has filed counterclaims against maxson and its shareholders as well as claims against the former maxson officer allegedly responsible for the embezzlement 
the bank is vigorously asserting its defenses and affirmative claims 
the discovery phase of the case has been completed  though the parties are attempting to resolve several discovery disputes

the court began hearing argument on the motions on march   and has expressed a desire to hear further argument 
there is currently no scheduled trial date 
during discovery  the plaintiffs have offered various theories and amounts of alleged damages  ranging from million to million  plus interest thereon 
the plaintiffs have also filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages 
the court has deferred ruling on whether to permit this amendment

securities designated as held to maturity are part of the corporation s portfolio of long term interest earning assets 
these securities are classified as long term because the corporation has the intent and ability to hold them until maturity 
securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
securities available for sale the amortized cost of securities available for sale at december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the amount 
this increase was due primarily to purchases of mortgage backed securities 
at december   the net unrealized gains on securities available for sale amounted to million  an increase of million from the comparable amount

nonaccrual loans loans  with the exception of certain well secured residential mortgage loans  are placed on nonaccrual status and interest recognition is suspended when such loans are days or more past due with respect to principal and or interest 
well secured residential mortgage loans are permitted to remain on accrual status provided that full collection of principal and interest is assured 
loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and interest is doubtful 
interest previously accrued  but uncollected  is reversed against current period income 
subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized as interest income  or recorded as a reduction of principal if full collection of the loan is doubtful or if impairment of the collateral is identified 
nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when the obligation has performed in accordance with the contract terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectibility of the contractual principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
included in accruing loans days or more past due at december  are residential mortgages amounting to thousand which are considered well collateralized and in the process of collection and therefore are deemed to have no loss exposure

these concessions include modifications of the terms of the debt such as reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments  extension of maturity dates  or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest 
the decision to restructure a loan  versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan  may benefit the corporation by increasing the ultimate probability of collection 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  and  are loans whose terms have been restructured amounting to thousand and thousand  respectively 
there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure and other legal means  and loans determined to be substantively repossessed 
a loan is considered to be substantively repossessed when the corporation has taken possession of the collateral  but has not completed legal foreclosure proceedings 
oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
a valuation allowance is maintained for declines in market value and estimated selling costs 
the balance of oreo amounted to thousand at december   down from the prior year amount of thousand 
decreases in oreo resulted from sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets that exceeded the level of foreclosures and repossessions 
during  proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties and repossessed assets amounted to thousand 
washington trust has provided financing to facilitate the sales of some of these properties 
financing is generally provided at market rates with credit terms similar to those available to other borrowers 
allowance for loan losses the corporation uses a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient allowance for loan losses all 
the methodology includes three elements identification of specific loan losses  general loss allocations for certain loan types based on credit grade and loss experience factors  and general loss allocations for other environmental factors 
the methodology includes an analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired in accordance with the terms of sfas other individual commercial and commercial mortgage loans are evaluated using an internal rating system and the application of loss allocation factors 
the loan rating system and the related loss allocation factors take into consideration the borrower s financial condition  the borrower s performance with respect to loan terms and the adequacy of collateral 
portfolios of more homogenous populations of loans including residential mortgages and consumer loans are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency ratios and other indicators  the corporation s historical loss experience and comparison to industry standards of loss allocation factors for each type of credit product 
finally  an additional unallocated allowance is maintained based on a judgmental process whereby management considers qualitative and quantitative assessments of other environmental factors 
for example  most of the loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in southern rhode island and southeastern connecticut and a substantial portion of the portfolio is collateralized by real estate in this area  including most consumer loans and those commercial loans not specifically classified as commercial mortgages 
a portion of the commercial and commercial mortgage loans are to borrowers in the hospitality and tourism industry and this concentration has been increasing in recent years 
economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements are considered including interest rates and energy costs 
results of regulatory examinations  historical loss ranges  portfolio composition including a trend toward somewhat larger credit relationships  and other changes in the portfolio are also considered 
the allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and is reduced by charge offs on loans 
the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  at december   compared to million  or  at december the following table reflects the activity in the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands years ended december  beginning balance   charge offs  net of recoveries residential real estate construction commercial mortgages construction and development other consumer net charge offs provision for loan losses   ending balance   allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans allowance for loan losses to total loans capital resources total shareholders equity increased million during and amounted to million at december  the overall increase was mainly attributable to earnings retention of million

litigation the bank is party to a lawsuit filed by a former corporate customer and the customer s shareholders for damages which the plaintiffs allegedly incurred as a result of an embezzlement by an officer and fifty percent shareholder of the customer 
management believes  based on its review with counsel of the development of this matter to date  that the bank has asserted meritorious affirmative defenses in this litigation 
additionally  the bank has filed counterclaims against the customer and its shareholders  as well as claims against the individual allegedly responsible for the embezzlement 
the bank is vigorously asserting its defenses and affirmative claims 
the discovery phase of the case has been completed  though the parties are attempting to resolve several discovery disputes 
the bank has also filed several motions  all of which seek dismissal of one or more of the plaintiffs claims and or exclusion of portions of the plaintiffs evidence 
the court began hearing argument on the motions on march   and has expressed a desire to hear further argument 
there is currently no scheduled trial date 
during discovery  the plaintiffs have offered various theories and amounts of alleged damages  ranging from million to million  plus interest thereon 
the plaintiffs have also filed a motion to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages 
the court has deferred ruling on whether to permit this amendment 
because of the numerous uncertainties that surround the litigation  management and legal counsel are unable to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that the bank may incur with respect to this litigation 
consequently  no loss provision for this lawsuit has been recorded 
recent accounting developments accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities standardizes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires a corporation to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement defines conditions and criteria to be used in designating a derivative as a specific type of hedging instrument 
sfas no 
also explains the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative  which depends on the intended use and the resulting designation 
under this statement  a corporation is required to establish at the inception of the hedge the method to be used for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
those methods must be consistent with the corporation s approach to managing risk 
the corporation adopted sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is one of the major market risks faced by the corporation 
the alco is responsible for establishing policy guidelines on liquidity and acceptable exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results which are consistent with washington trust s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco manages the corporation s interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month period 
the simulations assume that the size and general composition of the corporation s balance sheet remain constant over the month simulation horizon and take into account the specific repricing  maturity  call options  and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
non contractual savings deposits are classified as short term three months or less for both maturity and repricing purposes 
the characteristics of financial instrument classes are reviewed periodically by the alco to ensure their accuracy and consistency 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the negative exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
in addition  the alco reviews month horizon results to assess longer term risk inherent in the balance sheet 
as of december  and december   net interest income simulation indicated exposure to changing interest rates over a month horizon to a degree that remained within tolerance levels established by the corporation 
the corporation defines maximum unfavorable net interest income exposure to be a change of no more than in net interest income over the first months and no more than over the second months of the simulation horizon 
the following table summarizes the effect that interest rate shifts would have on net interest income for a month period using the corporation s on and off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  interest rates are assumed to shift by a parallel basis points over a month period  except for core savings deposits  which are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their historical insensitivity to rate changes 
further  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
it should be noted that the rate scenario used does not necessarily reflect the alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the next months 
furthermore  since a static balance sheet is assumed  the results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the corporation for the same period 
the following table presents these month net interest income simulation results dollars in thousands flat falling rising rates rates rates interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage backed securities    adjustable rate mortgage backed securities    callable securities    other securities    fixed rate mortgages    adjustable rate mortgages    other fixed rate loans    other adjustable rate loans    interest rate floor contracts net of premium amortization total interest income    interest bearing liabilities core savings deposits    time deposits    fhlb advances    other borrowings total interest expense    net interest income results as of december     net interest income results as of december     the alco estimates that the negative exposure of net interest income to falling rates results from the difficulty of reducing rates paid on deposits given the current level of interest rates 
if rates were to fall sharply and remain at low levels for a sustained period  retail deposit rates would likely fall by a limited amount  while rates earned on assets would drop more rapidly 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk since the repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments  especially core savings deposits  may change to a different degree than estimated 
in addition  since income simulations assume that the corporation s balance sheet will remain static over the month simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in parallel rate shifts of up to basis points 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure which may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to the corporation s capital position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
the following table summarizes the potential change in market value of the corporation s available for sale debt securities as of december  and resulting from immediate basis point parallel rate shifts dollars in thousands falling rising rates rates security type us treasury and government sponsored agency securities noncallable   us government sponsored agency securities callable  corporate securities fixed rate mortgage backed securities  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities   fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations adjustable rate collateralized mortgage obligations  total change in market value as of december    total change in market value as of december    the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities using value at risk analysis 
the anticipated maximum market value reduction for the bank s available for sale securities portfolio at december   including both debt and equity securities  was  assuming a one year time horizon and a probability of occurrence for value at risk analysis 
at december   gap analysis showed that the corporation s cumulative one year gap was a negative million  or of earning assets 
the following table details the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that are expected to mature or reprice in each of the time periods presented 
to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
fixed rate mortgages  mortgage backed securities and consumer installment loans have been allocated based on expected amortization and prepayment rates using standard industry assumptions 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are presented in the under three month category 
management believes that gap analysis has substantial limitations as a measure of interest rate risk  as it does not address the effect of changes in interest rates nor the magnitude of resulting changes in net interest income 
for this reason  the alco does not use gap analysis to establish interest rate risk targets or assess interest rate risk exposure 
the following table summarizes the corporation s gap analysis as of december  dollars in thousands months to months to over or less months to year years years interest earning assets loans      debt securities      other   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits     fhlb advances      other borrowings  total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap per period      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap      on occasion  the corporation has supplemented its interest rate risk management strategies with off balance sheet transactions 
such transactions are intended to hedge specifically identified risks inherent in the corporation s balance sheet  and not to produce speculative profits 
the corporation has written policy guidelines that designate limits on the notional value of off balance sheet transactions and require periodic evaluation of risks associated with these transactions  including counterparty credit risk 
during  the corporation entered into interest rate floor contracts with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in february during  the corporation entered into additional floor contracts with a notional principal amount of million and a five year term maturing in march these contracts are intended to function as a hedge against reductions in interest income realized from prime based loans 
these contracts were purchased for a total premium of million  which is amortized over the life of the contracts 
the corporation receives payment for these contracts if certain interest rates fall below specified levels 
during  the corporation recorded premium amortization  net of income  of thousand on its floor contracts
