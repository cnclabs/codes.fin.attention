item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
results of operations overview the following table sets forth for the years ended december   and  certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
all percentages are based on net sales 
items as a percentage of net sales years ended december net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring and other nonrecurring expenses 
income from operations interest expense income before income taxes net income comparison of years ended december  and sales for the year ended december   the company achieved a record sales level at million  a million or increase over net sales of million for the dramatic increase in net sales was attributable to very positive industry conditions and the benefits of the strategies that we have been implementing over the past several years 
this increase also reflects contributions from new sales offices and increased market share in most territories 
although sales for the year were strong  sales began to taper off in the fourth quarter due to a general industry slowdown and inventory corrections at the customer base 
gross profit gross profit was million in compared to million for  representing a increase 
the substantial increase in gross profit was due to the increase in sales as well as an improvement in gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for while the gross profit for the year was higher than the prior year  the gross profit margins began declining toward the end of  reflecting a general industry slowdown and greater availability of product 
in addition  we continue to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts that have required aggressive pricing programs and we expect a greater number of low margin  large volume transactions 
management therefore expects downward pressure on gross profit margins in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in variable expenses associated with the increases in sales and gross profit as well as an increase in our infrastructure to support the changing needs and additional requirements of our customers 
furthermore  in an effort to drive expansion and internal growth  we have increased and enhanced our management team and expanded our sales force in almost every location 
due to these factors  we expect that sg a will increase in future periods 
sg a as a percentage of net sales improved to for the year ended december   from for the period 
this improvement reflects the significant increase in sales which more than offset the increase in sg a in absolute dollars 
income from operations income from operations was million for  a increase over income from operations of million for the significant increase in income from operations was due to the increase in net sales and the increase in gross profit margins which more than offset the increase in sg a 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in average borrowings during to support the growth in sales and the expanded infrastructure  as well as increases in inventory purchases associated with initial stocking packages from new suppliers 
interest expense for also reflects an increase in interest rates 
net income net income increased dramatically to a record million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december   a increase over net income of million  or 
per share diluted  for the increase in net income reflects the increase in gross profit as well as the improvement in sg a as a percentage of sales  all of which was partially offset by the increase in interest expense 
comparison of years ended december  and sales for the year ended december   the company achieved sales of million  a million or increase over net sales of million for the increase resulted from improved conditions in the industry as well as from increased sales in most territories and contributions from two new sales offices that were opened during the second quarter of gross profit gross profit was million in compared to million for  representing a increase 
the increase in gross profit was due to the increase in sales which more than offset a decline in gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the decline in gross profit margins reflected the competitive market and excess supply conditions during the first half of  a greater number of low margin  large volume transactions than in the previous year  as well as continued changes in the company s product mix 
in addition  we continued to experience lower margins relating to the development of long term strategic relationships with accounts which have required aggressive pricing programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was million for  compared to million for the increase in sg a was primarily a result of an increase in our infrastructure to support the changing needs and additional requirements of our customers and increased variable expenses associated with the increases in sales and gross profit 
furthermore  in an effort to drive expansion and internal growth  we opened additional sales offices and increased and enhanced our management personnel during sg a as a percentage of net sales improved to for the year ended december   from for the period 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales reflected the significant increase in sales which more than offset the increase in sg a in absolute dollars 
income from operations income from operations was million for  a increase over income from operations of million for the increase in income from operations was due to the increase in net sales  which more than offset the impact of the decline in gross profit margins and the increase in sg a 
in addition  included a nonrecurring charge of million relating to a failed proposed merger 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in average borrowings during to support the growth in sales and the expanded infrastructure 
interest expense for also reflected a decrease in the company s borrowing rate 
net income net income increased dramatically to million  or 
per share diluted  for the year ended december   a increase over net income of  or 
per share diluted  for the increase in net income reflected the increase in gross profit that was partially offset by the increases in sg a and interest expense 
in addition  included a nonrecurring charge of million on an after tax basis relating to a failed proposed merger 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information 
in thousands  except per share data first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales         gross profit         income from operations         net income     diluted earnings per share 







as adjusted to reflect reverse stock split effective on june  liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  improved significantly to million  compared to working capital of million at december  the current ratio improved to at december   compared to at december  the increases in working capital and in the current ratio were due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
these changes in accounts receivable and inventory more than offset an increase in accounts payable 
accounts receivable levels at december  were million  compared to million at december  the increase in accounts receivable reflects the significant level of sales at the end of compared to the end of additionally  the average number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding increased to days as of december  compared to days as of december  inventory levels were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase primarily reflects higher inventory levels needed to support a higher level of sales and inventory relating to new suppliers added during accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of the increase in purchases of inventory at the end of in connection with initial stocking packages from new suppliers 
in september  the company s agreement with its consortium of banks was amended whereby the line of credit facility was increased from million to million and the term was extended to may  the line of credit facility  which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined in the agreement  currently bears interest  at the company s option  at the prime rate plus 
or libor plus 
on a quarterly basis  the applicable interest rate margins for the prime rate and libor options may be adjusted based upon our debt service coverage ratio for the month period ending on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter and our average excess loan availability for the three month period ending on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
the applicable interest rate margin for the prime rate option may adjust between to 
and the applicable interest rate margin for the libor option may adjust between to 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the company s assets including accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
under the credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants as well as to comply with certain financial ratios 
these covenants  among other things  place limitations and restrictions on the company s borrowings  investments and transactions with affiliates and prohibit dividends and stock redemptions 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain certain minimum levels of tangible net worth throughout the term of the agreement and a minimum debt service coverage ratio which is tested on a quarterly basis 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility aggregated million compared to million at december  the increase in outstanding borrowings reflects the significant growth in sales and the related increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
on may   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in purchase price of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share 
any shares of common stock repurchased will be available for reissuance in connection with the company s stock option plans or for other corporate purposes 
the company presently does not intend to make further stock repurchases at the current market prices 
the company expects that its cash flows from operations and additional borrowings available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet its current financial requirements over at least the next twelve months 
inflation and currency fluctuations the company does not believe that inflation significantly impacted its business during  however  inflation has had significant effects on the economy in the past and could adversely impact the company s results in the future 
the company believes that currency fluctuations could have adverse effects on its business if they make components manufactured abroad too expensive  cause limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or cause the company s offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
in certain prior years  the company believes that currency fluctuations have had such adverse effects 
forward looking statements  business risks this report contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  the words believes  estimates  plans  expects  intends  anticipates  contemplates  may  will  shall  assuming  prospect  should  could  looking forward and similar expressions  to the extent used  are intended to identify the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
in many cases  we cannot predict the risks or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as in other sections of this report and in other of our public filings and in our press releases 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
if one or more of our largest suppliers chooses not to sell products to us  our operating results could suffer 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for products which generate a significant portion of our sales 
substantially all of our inventory has and will be purchased from suppliers with which we have entered into non exclusive distributor agreements which are typically cancelable on short notice generally to days 
products purchased from our three largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our consolidated purchases during the calendar year ended december  no other supplier accounted for more than four percent of our consolidated purchases during this period 
while most of the products that we sell are available from other sources  our future success will depend in large part on maintaining relationships with existing suppliers and developing relationships with new ones 
we believe that the loss of a key supplier could have an adverse impact on our business in the short term as we attempt to replace the products offered by that supplier with the products of other suppliers 
if we were to lose our right to distribute the products of any particular supplier  there can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the products which were available from that particular supplier 
the loss of  or significant disruptions in relationships with  any of our largest suppliers or a significant number of other suppliers in a short period of time  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers and  as a result  our customers may be able to cancel  reduce or delay their orders without penalty 
we typically do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments but instead work with our customers to develop nonbinding forecasts of future orders 
based on such nonbinding forecasts  we make commitments regarding the level of business that we will seek and accept  and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
a variety of conditions  both specific to each individual customer and generally affecting each customer s industry  may cause our customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated 
generally  our customers may cancel  reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty or other charges associated with such cancellation  reduction or delay 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are dependent on foreign manufacturers and subject to trade regulations which expose us to political and economic risk 
a significant number of components sold by us are manufactured by foreign companies 
as a result  our ability to sell certain products at competitive prices could be adversely affected by any of the following increases in tariffs or duties  changes in trade treaties  strikes or delays in air or sea transportation  future united states legislation with respect to pricing and or import quotas on products imported from foreign countries  and turbulence in offshore economies or financial markets 
our ability to be competitive with respect to sales of imported components could also be affected by other governmental actions and policy changes  including anti dumping and other international antitrust legislation 
in addition  adverse currency fluctuations could have the effect of making components manufactured abroad more expensive  cause limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or cause our offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
because we purchase products from united states subsidiaries and affiliates of foreign manufacturers  our purchases are paid for in us dollars  which usually reduces or eliminates the potential adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that such factors could not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
our industry is subject to supply shortages 
any delay or inability to obtain components may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
at various times there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry and the availability of certain components have been limited by some of our suppliers 
although such shortages and allocations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results  there can be no assurance that any future shortages or allocations would not have such an effect on us 
our industry is cyclical  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
in the fall of  our industry emerged from a four year period of excess supply 
during the fourth quarter of  a combination of improved product availability  a slowing economy and other factors caused a sudden adverse change in market conditions in our industry 
we cannot predict the timing or the severity of the cycles within our industry 
the electronic components distribution industry has historically been affected by general economic downturns  which have often had an adverse economic effect upon manufacturers  end users of electronic components and electronic components distributors 
in addition  our industry directly depends on the continued growth of the electronic components industry and indirectly on the level of end user demand for our customers products 
due to changing conditions our customer base may experience periods of inventory corrections which could adversely impact our results 
furthermore  the timing of new product developments  the life cycle of existing electronic products  and the level of acceptance and growth of new products can affect demand for electronic components 
in that regard  the company supports certain new technologies  the failure of which to be fully accepted or grow could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
overall  these market changes and factors have caused in the past  and will likely cause in the future  our operating results to fluctuate 
the prices of our components are subject to volatility 
a significant portion of the memory products we sell have historically experienced volatile pricing 
if market pricing for these products decreases significantly  we may experience periods when our investment in inventory exceeds the market price of such products 
in addition  at times there are price increases from our suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
these market conditions could have a negative impact on our sales and gross profit margins unless and until our suppliers reduce the cost of these products to us 
we may not be able to satisfy our funding requirements 
we may need to spend significant amounts of cash to fund increases in expenses  meet our working capital requirements  invest in capital equipment and infrastructure  upgrade our information and communication systems  acquire businesses or open divisions  or respond to unanticipated developments such as an increase in bad debts  increasing customer demands or competitive pressures 
if we do not have enough cash on hand  cash generated from our operations or cash available under our credit facility to meet these cash requirements  we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to carry out our growth and operating strategies 
we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive 
if alternative sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable  we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans to the extent of available funding 
our industry is highly competitive and competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services and thereby reduce our market share 
the electronic components distribution industry is highly competitive 
we generally compete with local  regional and national distributors 
some of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial  personnel and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
emergence of new competitive business models could have adverse effects on our business 
recently  additional competition has emerged in the electronic components distribution industry 
this increased competition resulted from the advent of third party logistics and fulfillment companies  businesses commonly referred to as e exchanges and e brokers and several other forms of e commerce companies which have grown with the expanded use of the internet 
while we are aggressively working on developing and implementing our e commerce strategies  including our website and multiple portal development  to confront these new competitive business models  there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend our market share against the emergence of these or other new business models 
a reversal of the trend for distribution to play an increasing role in the electronic components industry could affect our business 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend for original equipment manufacturers and contract electronics manufacturers to outsource their procurement  inventory and materials management processes to third parties  particularly electronic component distributors 
although we do not currently foresee this trend reversing  if it did  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to manage and sustain future growth 
recently  we have experienced growth 
if we are to continue our growth  we will need to manage our expanding operations effectively and successfully integrate into our operations any new businesses or divisions which we may acquire or open 
if we are unable to do so  particularly in instances in which we have made significant investments  our failure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in sustaining continued growth if we are unable to secure adequate supplies of competitive products on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms  expand sales to existing customers and increase our customer base  turn our inventories and collect our accounts receivable fully and consistent with historical bad debt levels and in a timely manner  especially with respect to new customers in emerging markets  maintain our existing key supplier relationships as well as develop new relationships with leading suppliers of electronic components  hire and retain additional qualified management  marketing and other personnel to successfully manage our growth  including personnel to monitor our operations  control costs and maintain effective inventory and credit controls  and invest to maintain and enhance our infrastructure  including distribution center capacity  telecommunications and information systems  and logistics services 
a decline in gross profit margins arising from a change in market conditions or aggressive pricing programs could adversely affect our operating results 
during certain prior periods  we have experienced an increase in gross profit margins as a result of favorable market conditions in the electronic components distribution industry  including limited supply of certain products 
however  there is no assurance that negative changes in the economic environment generally and or in the electronic components industry in particular will not occur 
in fact  some of such negative changes in both the economic environment generally and in the electronic components industry began to occur in the fourth quarter of and continue to even a greater extent as of the date of this report 
furthermore  we continue to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts which have required aggressive pricing programs 
these factors could result in a decline in our gross profit margins  materially adversely affecting our operating results 
we are exposed to interest rate changes which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to our credit facility  which currently is based upon  at our option  the prime rate or libor 
our operations would be adversely affected if third party carriers were unable to transport or were materially hindered in transporting our products 
all of our products are shipped through third party carriers  principally one carrier 
if a strike or other event prevented or materially hindered or disrupted that carrier from transporting our products  there is no assurance that other carriers would be available or have the capacity to deliver our products to our customers 
if adequate third party sources to ship our products were not available at any time  our operating results would be materially and adversely effected 
we depend on the continued services of our executive officers  and their loss could affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
we are highly dependent upon the services of our president and chief executive officer 
the permanent loss for any reason of our president and chief executive officer  or any one or more of our other key executives  could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
while we believe that we would be able to locate suitable replacements for our executives if their services were lost  there can be no assurance that we would  in fact  be able to do so 
we must attract and retain personnel to help support our future growth  and competition for personnel in our industry is intense 
we require the services of a substantial number of qualified personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management  engineering  sales  marketing  information technology  distribution and finance personnel 
the recent market for such skilled and experienced personnel is characterized by intense competition and aggressive recruiting  as well as a high degree of employee mobility 
this market makes it particularly difficult to attract and retain the qualified personnel we require 
the loss of or our inability to continue to attract and retain these key personnel could harm our business 
any acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations 
our growth in the future may depend  in part  on our ability to acquire compatible electronic components distributors or other businesses and to integrate the acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate additional appropriate acquisition candidates  or that we will be successful in acquiring any identified candidates 
in addition  we cannot be certain that the operations of any acquired companies will be effectively integrated or prove profitable 
the completion of future acquisitions may require the expenditure of sizable amounts of capital and management effort 
moreover  unexpected problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our officers and directors have and will continue to have significant control over us 
if the company s chairman and president and chief executive officer exercised all of their outstanding stock options  they and their respective spouses and children and related trusts would own an aggregate of approximately  shares  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result of such stock ownership and their positions as executive officers  as the members of the executive committee of our board of directors and as two of the seven directors of all american  they are and will continue to be in a position to control the day to day affairs of all american 
we may be exposed to product liability claims 
we are likely to be named as a defendant in any products liability action brought by an end user as a result of our value added services and as a participant in the distribution chain between the manufacturer and end user 
although to date there have been no material claims asserted against us for products liability  there can be no assurance that such claims will not arise in the future 
in the event that any products liability claim is not covered by insurance or we are not indemnified by or cannot recover damages from our supplier of the product or another third party in the chain of distribution  we may be required to fund some or all of a product liability claim  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our shareholder rights plan  preferred stock and governing documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our business 
we have a shareholders rights plan and have authorized preferred stock which is available to be issued with such rights  preferences  privileges and limitations as are determined by the board of directors 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation includes provisions designed to discourage attempts by others to acquire control of us without negotiation with our board of directors  and to attempt to ensure that such transactions are on terms favorable to all of our shareholders 
these provisions provide  among other things that meetings of our shareholders may only be called by the board of directors  that an affirmative vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve certain business combinations unless of our board approves such transaction  for three classes of directors with each class elected for a three year staggered term  that our board in evaluating a tender offer or certain business combinations is authorized to give due consideration to all relevant factors  and that actions of shareholders may not be taken by written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting 
for various reasons  however  these provisions may not always be in the best interest of our shareholders 
these reasons include the fact that the provisions of our certificate of incorporation i make it difficult to remove directors even if removal would be in the best interest of our shareholders  ii make it difficult for our shareholders to approve certain transactions that are not approved by at least of our board  even if the transactions would be beneficial to our shareholders  and iii eliminate the ability of our shareholders to act without a meeting 
our shareholder rights plan  our blank check preferred stock and our governing documents may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of all american  could discourage potential investors from bidding for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and could adversely affect the market price and the voting rights of the holders of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
if market interest rates increase  the impact may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results
