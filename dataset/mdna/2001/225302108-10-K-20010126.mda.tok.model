the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in risk factors and elsewhere herein 
revenue growth has slowed in the first quarter of fiscal in the test and assembly sector of the semiconductor equipment industry during what we now believe is a cyclical downturn in the industry 
there is uncertainty as to if and when the next cyclical growth phase will occur 
until such time as we return to a growth period  we expect a continuing decline in orders and therefore expect that the january  fiscal quarter s revenue will be down at least from those recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter of in light of that belief  the company will be taking steps in the near term to reduce our expense structure to match our lower anticipated revenues 
our sales  gross margins and operating results have in the past fluctuated significantly and will  in the future  fluctuate significantly depending upon a variety of factors 
the factors that have caused and will continue to cause our results to fluctuate include cyclicality or downturns in the semiconductor market and the markets served by our customers  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of our products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the start up of new products  changes in pricing by us  our competitors  customers or suppliers  the ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  inventory obsolescence  patterns of capital spending by customers  delays  cancellations or reschedulings of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  product discounts  product reliability  the proportion of direct sales and sales through third parties  including distributors and original equipment manufacturers  the mix of products sold  the length of manufacturing and sales cycles  natural disasters  political and economic instability  regulatory changes and outbreaks of hostilities 
due to these and additional factors  historical results an d percentage relationships discussed in this annual report on form k will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period

net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of systems  upgrades  spare parts  maintenance contracts and software 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales increased from million in the first quarter of fiscal  reaching million in the fourth fiscal quarter of and then rose to million for the fourth fiscal quarter of this was in sharp contrast to when our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales improved each sequential quarter because of three principal factors a significant increase in the worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  improved business and economic conditions in asia and particularly in taiwan  and the increased sales of two major products that were recently launched the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
these factors plus the acquisition of the tmt product lines in may resulted in our experiencing increasing net sales activity through fiscal and the improved worldwide demand for semiconductor ate has led to customers purchasing for increased capacity and the launch of our new products has led to some customers purchasing products with new features or capabilities 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage of net sales is attributable principally to sales derived from the kalos product line 
the increase in the mixed signal percentage of net sales is principally derived from the sales of the quartet product and the acquired tmt product lines 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than and less than of our net sales in each respective period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in was due primarily to higher average selling prices during the latter half of fiscal and into fiscal as well as efficiencies caused by the higher manufacturing volumes in research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses increased in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting higher investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
the company has experienced higher business activity levels in fiscal and these have resulted in significant internal headcount growth as well as the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa during fiscal year we currently intend to continue to invest significant resources in the development of new products and enhancements for the foreseeable future and would expect r d expenses to be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than those recorded in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from much higher business activity levels 
these higher activity levels have resulted in significant internal headcount growth as well as the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa during fiscal year during early fiscal  we undertook a project to replace a majority of our financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc this system became operational in june in september  we relocated our oregon operations to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
because of these acquisitions and other investments  we anticipate that sg a expenses will be higher in absolute dollars in fiscal than those recorded in fiscal amortization of purchased intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangible expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million  in august we purchased mi for approximately million and credence europa for approximately million  and in october we purchased nms for approximately million 
these acquisitions have resulted in approximately million  million  million  and million  respectively  in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangibles 
in september  we purchased opmaxx for million 
this acquisition resulted in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangibles of million 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets to be used in the business as well as research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
the purchased intangibles consist of developed technology  assembled workforce  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks  patents  and goodwill and they typically have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
intangible purchased assets are generally evaluated on a market by market basis in making a determination as to whether such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are still appropriate 
periodically  the company reviews its long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
in process research and development 
in may  we purchased tmt for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
in august  we purchased mi for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of ipr d 
in october  we purchased nms for approximately million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired ipr d 
in september  we purchased opmaxx for million 
in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of ipr d 
the company worked with an independent consultant to perform an allocation of the purchase price for the tmt  mi  and nms acquisitions to their respective individual assets using the income approach 
our income approach utilized a discounted future earnings methodology 
our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
our review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to us in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the ipr d acquired from tmt consists of products and projects related to analog and radio frequency test products 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of the asl product as well as further versions of the rfx product 
we estimated that these projects varied in terms of completion from to completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the expected completion dates of these projects range from currently completed to the first quarter of fiscal the ipr d acquired from mi consists of products and projects related to radio frequency test products 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of the mi a product in various forms 
we estimated that these projects varied in terms of completion from to completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the expected completion dates of these projects range from early fiscal to late fiscal the ipr d acquired from nms consists of products and projects related to application specific testing products asts 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of an asts tester 
we estimated that these projects were approximately completed based on research and development complexity  costs  and time expended to date relative to the expected remaining costs and time to reach technological feasibility 
the expected completion date of these projects is the second fiscal quarter of the ipr d acquired from opmaxx consists of products and projects related to analog and mixed signal self test 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of design verification and sensitivity analysis  design fault coverage  test evaluation and optimization 
we estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on time spent and complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
these projects were completed in fiscal special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was for employee severance and million was for abandoned facilities 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries at that time as well as the decision to relocate our oregon operations from a facility in beaverton to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
this charge included expenses related to the opmaxx acquisition of million as well as the million write down of certain intangible assets from another acquisition in the integration of opmaxx with fluence 
extraordinary gain extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax extraordinary gain of million for the retirement of million of our convertible subordinated notes in exchange for  shares of our common stock held in treasury 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to higher average cash and investment balances in as compared to these higher average balances were the result of cash received in our secondary public offering in february offset by cash outlays for acquisitions in the year and the purchase of our hillsboro facility 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expense on a lower average outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal the effective tax rate was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to benefits of the company s foreign sales subsidiary  partially offset by non deductible in process research and development expenses and non deductible goodwill amortization 
the tax benefit rate for fiscal of was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible in process research and development expenses 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
at october  and  the goodwill and other intangible assets represented and of total assets  respectively  and and of stockholders equity  respectively 
these assets principally arose from the acquisitions of tmt  mi  nms  and credence europa in fiscal  the acquisition of opmaxx in fiscal  and the acquisition of hpl in fiscal the estimated useful lives of these assets range from three to ten years 
goodwill and intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition  market  or product basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
periodically  the company reviews its long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attribut able to the assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
no significant impairment charges have been recorded in fiscal years through vs 
net sales 
net sales declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our net sales increased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal this was in sharp contrast to when our net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our net sales improved each sequential quarter because of three principal factors a significant increase in the worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  improved business and economic conditions in asia and particularly in taiwan  and the launch of three major products the valstar high performance digital tester  the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
these factors resulted in our experiencing increasing net sales activity through fiscal the improved worldwide demand for semiconductor ate has led to customers purchasing for increased capacity and the launch of our new products has led to some customers purchasing products with new features or capabilities 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
our net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for our products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may reoccur or worsen  which could materially adversely affect demand for our products 
our net sales by product line in fiscal and consisted of mixed signal logic memory service and software total the increase in the memory percentage and the high percentage of net sales attributable to mixed signal products is principally derived from the sales of the new kalos and quartet products 
revenues from software were not material to our operations in fiscal and  representing less than of our net sales in each period 
gross margin 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in was due primarily to relatively low gross margins in attributable to the special charges taken in that year 
we recorded special charges to cost of goods sold in totaling million  consisting primarily of write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  as more fully described below 
additionally  gross margins were negatively impacted due to lower average selling prices caused by increased competition in the markets the company serves and due to inefficiencies caused by the lower manufacturing volumes 
research and development 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses declined in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting lower investments in the development of new products  and enhancements of existing product lines 
we restructured our business in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to a major downturn in the business at that time 
as a result of that industry downturn  we downsized our operations including reduced headcount  reduced and delayed projects including facility expansions and certain research and development projects 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted primarily from our downsizing which occurred in the latter half of fiscal we restructured our business in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal in response to a major downturn in the business at that time 
as a result of that industry downturn  we downsized our operations including reduced headcount  reduced and delayed projects including facility expansions 
during early fiscal  we undertook a project to replace a majority of our financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc this system became operational in june in september  we re located our oregon operations to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangible expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
in september we purchased opmaxx  inc for approximately million 
this acquisition resulted in quarterly charges for amortization of purchased intangibles of approximately million 
the remaining balance of the fiscal amortization of purchased intangibles consists of approximately million for the purchased intangibles of hpl and million for the purchased intangibles of zycad 
the company accelerated the write down of certain hpl intangible assets in fiscal to reflect changes in estimate for useful lives 
in process research and development 
in september  we purchased opmaxx  inc for million in cash and the assumption of liabilities and the conversion of employee stock options worth million 
additionally  we agreed to make payments to the common shareholders of opmaxx in an amount equal to of the net receipts from sales of the opmaxx products from september through december  in connection with this acquisition  we recognized million of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
opmaxx is being integrated with our subsidiary  fluence technology  inc our management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated by both interviews and data analysis to determine our state of development and related fair value 
our review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to us in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the ipr d acquired from opmaxx consists of products and projects related to analog and mixed signal self test 
these products and projects are aimed at the development of design verification and sensitivity analysis  design fault coverage  test evaluation and optimization 
we estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on time spent and complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
special charges 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was for employee severance and million was for abandoned facilities 
these charges were recorded as a result of our response to a major downturn in the business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries at that time as well as the decision to relocate our oregon operations from a facility in beaverton to a newly constructed facility in hillsboro  oregon 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million 
this charge included expenses related to the opmaxx acquisition of million as well as the million write down of certain intangible assets from another acquisition in the integration of opmaxx with fluence 
extraordinary gain extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal  we recorded a pre tax extraordinary gain of million for the retirement of million of our convertible subordinated notes in exchange for  shares of our common stock held in treasury 
interest income 
we generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower average cash and investment balances in as compared to these lower average balances were the result of our net losses in fiscal as well as million dispersed for the repurchase of our common stock during interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower interest expense on a lower outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
our effective tax benefit rate for fiscal and was 
the tax benefit rate for both years was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to non deductible in process research and development expenses 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to net income before depreciation and amortization of million  offset by cash used for net changes in the operating assets and liabilities  particularly accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million 
this cash was primarily used for net purchases of property and equipment of million including our facility in hillsboro oregon  million was used to purchase intangible assets including tmt  mi  credence europa  and nms and net purchases of available for sale securities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in our february public offering for million as well as common stock and treasury stock issued in accordance with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
in september  the remaining convertible subordinated notes were called for redemption by the company 
of the million principal amount of notes outstanding  approximately  of notes were redeemed for cash and the remaining notes were converted by the holders into  shares of common stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of million 
all the shares were put into treasury stock 
subsequent to october   the company repurchased an additional  shares at a cost of million 
as of october   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities  compared with million at october  additionally  as of october   we have operating leases for facilities and test and other equipment totaling approximately million due through we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy our financing requirements for at least the next months 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of our testers and the new products we have introduced and plan to continue to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
significant investments in accounts receivable and inventories subject us to increased risks  and could continue to materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by us 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to the above factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to our estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of costs accrued for warranty and other liabilities 
such changes could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  which is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after june  sfas will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
adoption of sfas is not expected to have a mater ial impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
all registrants are expected to apply the accounting principles and disclosure described in sab because the company has complied with generally accepted accounting principles for its historical revenue recognition  the change in its revenue policy resulting from sab will be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment resulting from a change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter of fiscal adoption of sab will also require the company to re state the quarterly results for the eight fiscal quarters ended october  the company is currently in the process of assessing sab and is therefore unable to determine the impact of sab on its financial statements
