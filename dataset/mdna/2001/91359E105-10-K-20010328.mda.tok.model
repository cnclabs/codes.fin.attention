general the average occupancy rate of a hospital is affected by a number of factors  including the number of physicians using the hospital  changes in the number of beds  the composition and size of the population of the community in which the hospital is located  general and local economic conditions  variations in local medical and surgical practices and the degree of outpatient use of the hospital services 
the trust s hospital facilities continue to experience a shift in payor mix resulting in an increase in revenues attributable to managed care payors and unfavorable general industry trends which include pressures to control healthcare costs 
in general  the operators of the trust s facilities expect to continue to experience an increase in business from managed care programs  including health maintenance organizations hmos and preferred provider organizations ppos 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of the trust s facilities vary among the markets in which the trust s facilities operate 
outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities  outpatient surgical centers  and freestanding ambulatory surgical centers also impact the healthcare marketplace 
many of the trust s facilities continue to experience an increase in outpatient revenues which is primarily the result of advances in medical technologies and pharmaceutical improvements  which allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  and increased pressure from medicare  medicaid  hmos  ppos and insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
the hospital industry in the united states  as well as the trust s hospital facilities  continue to have significant unused capacity which has created substantial competition for patients 
inpatient utilization continues to be negatively affected by payor required  pre admission authorization and by payor pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
the trust expects its hospital facilities to continue to experience increased competition and admission constraints 
the medicare program reimburses the operators of the trust s hospitals primarily based on established rates by a diagnosis related group for acute care hospitals and by cost based formula for behavioral health facilities 
historically  rates paid under medicare s prospective payment system pps for inpatient services have increased  however  these increases have been less than cost increases 
pursuant to the terms of bba  there were no increases in the rates paid to hospitals for inpatient care through september  and reimbursement for bad debt expense and capital costs as well as other items were reduced 
during the fourth quarter of  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa which  among other things  increased medicare and medicaid payments to health care providers by billion over years with approximately billion of this amount targeted for hospitals and billion for managed care payors 
these increased reimbursements to hospitals pursuant to the terms of bipa will commence in april  and for the period of april  through september   the additional reimbursements will be remitted to hospitals at twice the scheduled amounts 
bba established the annual update for medicare at market basket minus in both fiscal years october  through september  and and bipa revised the update at the full market basket in fiscal year and market basket minus 
in fiscal years and additionally  bba reduced reimbursement to hospitals for medicare bad debts to and bipa increased the reimbursement to  with an effective date for the trust s hospital facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs of january  a large portion of the trust s non hospital properties consist of medical office buildings which are located either close to or on the campuses of hospital facilities 
these properties are either directly or indirectly affected by the factors discussed above as well as general real estate factors such as the supply and demand of office space and market rental rates 
market risks associated with financial instruments the trust s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of the trust s debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are contracts that require the trust to pay a fixed and receive a floating interest rate over the life of the agreements 
the floating rates are based on libor and the fixed rates are determined upon consummation of the swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements do not constitute positions independent of the underlying exposures 
the trust does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any instruments with leverage features 
the trust is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparties to its financial instruments
