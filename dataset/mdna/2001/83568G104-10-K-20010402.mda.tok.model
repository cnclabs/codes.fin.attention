item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sonosite commenced operations as a project of atl ultrasound  inc atl 
we were formed to develop the design and specifications for a highly portable ultrasound device and other highly portable ultrasound products for diagnostic imaging in a multitude of clinical and field settings 
on april   we became an independent  publicly owned company through a tax free distribution of one new share in us for every three shares of atl stock held as of that date 
atl retained no ownership in sonosite following the spin off 
we finalized the development and began commercialization of our first products in  recognizing our initial product sales revenue in september continuing to develop and enhance our products in  we introduced the sonoheart system for cardiology and the high frequency sonosite system along with three new transducers 
as of december   our products were comprised of two highly portable ultrasound systems  the sonosite and sonoheart systems  and five transducers 
initially  we sold our products primarily through medical product distributors worldwide 
in february  recognizing the need for and potential of a direct selling operation  we established a direct sales force focused exclusively on selling our products within the united states 
in  we began to see success in terms of revenue generated by this direct selling force 
additionally  we continued to identify international markets for our products and distribution partners within these markets 
in the future  our prospects and ability to grow a profitable business will depend on our ability to effectively market and sell our products to a variety of customers  both in terms of geography and medical segment 
we identified those markets where we believe our products will generate sales and possess a significant opportunity to have a positive medical impact 
these markets include obstetrics and gynecology  emergency medicine  radiology and surgery 
in addition  we believe that our products can be successfully marketed and sold to address many other medical applications  of which many currently do not use ultrasound 
since operations began  we have incurred losses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses unless and until our product sales generate sufficient revenue to fund our continuing operations 
we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and sales revenue sales revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase is due to the fact that benefited from a full year of product sales as compared to four months in when shipments began 
initial shipments in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of were primarily to meet initial distributor demand 
in the second quarter of  we released our high frequency version of the sonosite system and linear transducer  which resulted in additional second quarter sales to distributors 
as initial orders from distributors decreased  sales revenue decreased during the the third and fourth quarters of and consisted primarily of direct sales in the united states and reorders from our distributors due to sell through to end customers 
in  sales revenue by region was in the united states  in japan  in europe  africa and the middle east and in the rest of the world 
we anticipate that sales revenue will increase in as compared to prior years due to our expanded direct selling efforts  new product developments  new corporate customer agreements and overall expansion of general market awareness of the company and our products 
grant revenue there was no grant revenue for the year ended december  grant revenue was recognized under the terms of our contract with the united states department of defense and generally has been tied to achieving technological milestones 
grant revenue for the years ended december  and was  and  no future grant revenue is expected 
gross margin on sales revenue the gross margin on sales revenue for the years ended december  and was and 
we had no product sales and therefore no reported gross margin in any other prior period 
we anticipate that the gross margin on our product sales will increase in due primarily to our increasing percentage of direct sales compared to distributor sales  which include a standard discount 
additionally  at the end of  we brought manufacturing in house 
with this transfer of manufacturing  we anticipate product costs will decrease over as production volume increases 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
upon our initial product release in september and for all of  production costs are reflected in inventory and cost of sales revenue rather than expensed as research and development expenses 
as a result  research and development expenses decreased by million in compared to the increase of million in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily the result of a planned increase in research and development activities relating to our initial product release 
these planned increases included additional costs for personnel  tooling and design verification  validation and finalization 
we anticipate that research and development spending levels will increase in as compared to sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
the significant  anticipated increase of million in compared to is due to our initial product release in september and subsequent product releases  resulting in increased marketing and selling costs to support both our product sales and market awareness 
during  the addition of sales managers and a contract direct selling force represented approximately one half of the year to year increase 
the remaining increase is due to increased costs to support the launch of several products during the year  including the sonoheart system  the high frequency sonosite system and three transducers 
each launch resulted in promotional costs such as print media  tradeshows and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million in compared to the significant increase in expenses in sales and marketing in resulted primarily from an increase in personnel as well as activities associated with the worldwide introduction and promotion of our first products 
specific expenses included professional service fees  print media  customer training  tradeshow and travel expenses 
we continue to recognize the need to support our existing products and expect marketing and selling costs in will increase as we increase the size of our direct selling force 
this increase includes expanding our direct selling efforts to certain european markets 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
the increase of million in compared to primarily related to the costs of moving into larger facilities in june  an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and added personnel in our general and administrative functions to support our growth 
the increase in as compared to was approximately  the increase was directly the result of representing our first full year of operations apart from atl 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain relatively stable in other income other income for the years ended december   and were million  million and  in  other income consisted of million of interest income  which was partially offset by  of interest expense and  of losses from equity investments 
the increase in interest income between and of approximately  is due to our higher average investment balance resulting from equity proceeds of million received in the increase in equity investment losses was primarily the result of losses in equity investees and termination of a business relationship with one of our affiliates when we decided to discontinue contracting for our direct sales representatives  who became sonosite employees in early other income increased to million in from  in  an increase of million 
the increase primarily related to the increase in interest income  which corresponds with our increase in our average investment balance during as compared to the increase is due to our higher average investment balance resulting from the million equity contribution from atl and million in net proceeds from two equity offerings completed in liquidity and capital resources in  our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased million 
this decrease was the result of million used in operating activities  which was primarily comprised of our net loss of million and the increase in inventory of million 
these operating cash uses were partially offset by cash changes in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses of million and depreciation expense of million 
also contributing to the changes in cash were investing activities utilizing million  which primarily related to purchases of property and equipment of million  and financing activities providing million  which primarily related to the exercise of stock options of million 
in  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
this increase primarily related to the million raised through the sale of common stock and million contributed by atl 
these increases were partially offset by cash used in operations of million and cash used in investing activities of million primarily for the purchase of investment securities 
during the year ended december   our primary source of operating capital was obtained from our sales revenue and cash on hand that was obtained from public and private capital financing in prior years 
in april  we raised net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock 
in november  we raised additional net proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our common stock 
we also received million from atl in connection with our spin off  of which million was received in and million in we expect our cash requirements to continue in future periods as we continue to fund losses until we can generate sufficient revenues to meet our operating expenses 
however  we expect our cash requirement to decrease in compared to due to an increase in sales revenue 
we expect operating expenses to increase as we continue to fund our manufacturing and research and development activities  increase our direct selling efforts and targeted marketing plans  enhance our educational offerings and provide adequate administrative support for these areas 
we believe that our existing cash will be sufficient to fund our operations through however  it is difficult to accurately predict the amount of cash that we may require during actual cash needs will depend in part upon factors beyond our control  such as lower than anticipated revenues  technical obstacles  market acceptance of our products  disruption in manufacturing or the supply of raw materials  economic circumstances and cost overruns 
if additional capital is required  we cannot assure you that adequate financing will be available on a timely basis  on terms acceptable to us  or at all

sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which will be effective for the year sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we assessed the impact of sfas and do not expect that our adoption of the standard will have a material effect on our financial results

prior period results have been reclassified to properly reflect the requirements of eitf item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk  as a result of changes in interest rates  relates primarily to debt securities held in our investment portfolio  all valued in united states dollars usds and impacted by fluctuations primarily in the domestic interest rates 
our policy is to limit our interest rate risk by investing in high quality short term instruments with companies rated a or better by moody s or standard and poor s or commercial paper rated a or p or better 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and million in debt securities  all maturing within one year 
although we hold both fixed and floating rate securities and each carry a certain degree of interest rate risk  we do not consider this risk to be material to our financial statements given their short terms 
foreign currency risk we transact all our sales in usds and therefore  the obligations of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by our international customers 
as of december   of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers and no single customer accounted for over million owed to us 
however  a single customer located in brazil was indebted to us for approximately of our outstanding receivable balance  a portion of which was classified as an other long term asset 
we review our receivable position in varying economies regularly for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we are beginning to utilize letters of credit regularly to mitigate our collection risk
