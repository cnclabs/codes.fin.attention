item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income and expense items as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold marketing and administrative expenses research and development expenses bad debt expenses write down of impaired assets income from operations net income overview of and outlook in  the company had a difficult year 
the first two quarters of the year were very strong with growth in diluted earnings per share of and  respectively 
as a result of weakness in the second half in the paper  steel and construction industries  and approximately million in charges  which are described below  diluted earnings per share declined for the year as compared with the prior year 
the company expects continued weakness in the first half of during the second half of  economic trends in the industries the company serves  particularly in the united states  deteriorated significantly 
three paper mills at which the company has satellite precipitated calcium carbonate pcc plants announced their intention to shut down  two owned by international paper company and one by plainwell inc  which filed a chapter bankruptcy petition 
other paper makers reduced inventories as a result of weaker paper demand 
the domestic steel industry experienced an extreme downturn domestic steel production  which increased approximately in the first half of  decreased approximately in the fourth quarter 
several steel manufacturers  including two major customers of the company  filed for bankruptcy protection 
the construction and automotive industries were also affected adversely by the weaker economy and higher energy costs 
as a consequence of these adverse events the company recorded a million write down of impaired assets related to the three satellite pcc plants at paper mills that have ceased or will cease operations 
the company also recognized million in additional bad debt expenses  primarily related to the bankruptcies of major customers in the steel  paper and construction industries 
the company adhered to its strategy of expanding its pcc product line within the specialty minerals segment 
the company commenced operations at two new satellite pcc plants  one in japan and the other in brazil and began operations at a major three unit expansion of a satellite pcc plant in portugal 
together  these plants have production capacity equivalent to approximately seven satellite units 
a satellite unit is equivalent to annual production capacity of between  and  tons of pcc 
the company also added another eight units of volume in through various expansions at existing satellite facilities 
in january  the company announced a new contract with great northern paper company in millinocket  maine to construct a two unit satellite plant using the company s patented at tm pcc technology 
this plant is expected to be in operation in the third quarter of the at tm pcc technology continues to show growth and the groundwood sector of the worldwide paper industry continues to show widespread interest in this product 
the company presently serves groundwood paper mills on paper machines around the world 
as a result  sales of pcc as a percentage of the company s total net sales  which were in  had risen to approximately by the company expects additional expansions at existing satellite pcc plants to occur in and also expects to sign contracts for new satellite pcc plants 
in  the company plans to continue its focus on the following growth strategies for the pcc product line continued efforts to increase market penetration in north america  europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
continued expansions of the capacity of existing satellite pcc plants in response to increased demand  which is resulting from increased pcc filler levels in paper  the installation of new paper machines or higher paper machine productivity 
continued research and development and marketing efforts for new and existing products 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies 
the company s sales of pcc are predominantly pursuant to long term agreements  generally ten years in length  with paper mills at which the company operates satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a number of the company s customers to renew existing agreements on terms as favorable to the company as those currently in effect could cause the future growth rate of the company to differ materially from its historical growth rate 
on february   the company signed an agreement to purchase the refractories business of martin marietta magnesia specialties inc for million 
this transaction is expected to close within the second quarter of net sales of this business for the year ended december  were approximately million 
the company will continue to emphasize specialty products in its refractories segment and to develop and commercialize products  processes and equipment resulting from its research and development efforts 
as the company continues to expand its operations overseas  it faces the inherent risks of doing business abroad  including exchange rate fluctuations  nationalization  expropriation  limitations on repatriation of funds and other factors 
in addition  the company s performance depends to some extent on that of the industries it serves  particularly the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing  and construction industries

the increase in pcc sales was primarily attributable to the commencement of operation at two new satellite pcc plants  the ramp up of two satellite plants that began operations in  and to volume increases and expansions at several long standing pcc plants 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of specialty pcc  which is used for non paper applications  and by weakness in the paper industry in the second half of pcc sales in increased to million from million in this growth was primarily attributable to the start up of operations at two of the company s largest satellite plants in in addition  a full year of operations at several satellite pcc plants that began operations in and volume increases from the company s long standing satellite pcc plants also contributed to the sales growth

this report may contain forward looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions 
words such as expects  plans  anticipates  will  and words and terms of similar substance  used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify these forward looking statements 
the company cannot guarantee that the outcomes suggested in any forward looking statement will be realized  although it believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions 
achievement of future results is subject to risks  uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions 
should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements and should refer to the discussion of certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions under the heading cautionary factors that may affect future results in item several acquisitions in the paper industry have taken place in the last two years 
such acquisitions could result in partial or total closure of some paper mills at which the company operates pcc satellites 
such closures would reduce the company s sales of pcc  except to the extent that they resulted in paper production and associated purchases of pcc shifting to another location served by the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will occur 
in addition  such acquisitions concentrate purchasing power in the hands of a smaller number of papermakers  enabling them to increase competitive pressure on their suppliers  such as the company 
such increased pressure could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company s largest customer  international paper company  has decided to reduce us production capacity by closing two paper mills in which the company has satellite pcc plants 
these paper mills are located in mobile  alabama  and lock haven  pennsylvania 
in addition  plainwell inc filed for bankruptcy protection and closed its paper mill in plainwell  michigan 
the company operates a small satellite pcc plant at that location 
as a result of these plant closings  the company recorded a million write down of impaired assets 
excluding the plants to be closed  there are three satellite locations  serving two customers  at which our contracts have recently expired or are due to expire by the end of the company continues to supply pcc at all of these locations and expects to negotiate long term contract extensions at all of them 
there is no assurance  however  that these negotiations will be successful 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company 
the contracts pursuant to which the company constructs and operates its satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of the company s sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing industries and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
these industries encountered difficulties in the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
for this reason  and because of the geographical diversification of our business  the company s operating results to date have not been materially affected by the difficult economic environment 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve 
there can be no assurance that a recession  in some markets or worldwide  would not have a significant negative effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement  as amended  is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas by january  adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
this pronouncement was effective in the fourth quarter of and all prior periods were reclassified to comply with the classification guidelines of this issue 
eitf issue stipulates that all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping and handling represent revenues earned for the goods provided and should be classified as revenue 
in addition  costs incurred for shipping and handling should preferably be classified as costs of goods sold 
the company has historically recorded the net costs of shipping and handling in marketing and administrative expenses since the majority of such costs are a direct pass through of costs to the customer 
adjustments were reflected in the statement of income and related footnotes in order to comply with this pronouncement 
adoption of a common european currency on january   eleven european countries adopted the euro as their common currency 
from that date until january   debtors and creditors may choose to pay or be paid in euros or in the former national currencies 
on and after january   the affected national currencies will cease to be legal tender 
the company s information technology systems are now able to convert among the former national currencies and the euro and to process transactions and balances in euros 
the financial institutions with which the company does business are capable of receiving deposits and making payments both in euros and in the national currencies 
the company does not expect that adapting its information technology systems to the euro will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company is also reviewing contracts with customers and vendors calling for payments in currencies that are to be replaced by the euro  and intends to complete in a timely way any required changes to those contracts 
adoption of the euro is likely to have competitive effects in europe  as prices that had been stated in different national currencies become directly comparable to one another 
in addition  the adoption of a common monetary policy by the countries adopting the euro can be expected to have an effect on the economy of the region 
these competitive and economic effects had no material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operation during  and the company does not expect any such effect to occur 
there can be no assurance  however  that the transition to the euro will not have a material effect on the company s business in europe in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts would not subject the company to additional risk from exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
at december   the company had open forward exchange contracts to purchase million of foreign currencies 
these contracts mature on march  the fair value of these instruments was not significant at december
