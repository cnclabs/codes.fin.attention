as of december   the company provided cellular telephone service to  subscribers in georgia  alabama  south carolina and florida in a total of licensed service areas  composed of eight msa s and eight rsa s  with an aggregate estimated population of million 
the company sells its cellular telephone service as well as a full line of cellular products and accessories principally through its network of retail stores 
the company markets all of its products and services under the nationally recognized service mark cellularone 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  the percentage which certain amounts bear to total revenue 
for the year ended december  revenue service equipment sales and installation total revenue operating expenses engineering  technical and other direct engineering and technical other direct costs of services cost of equipment selling  general and administrative selling and marketing customer service general and administrative non cash compensation 
depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation consists of costs of cellular telephone network  including inter trunk costs  span line costs  cell site repairs and maintenance  cell site utilities  cell site rent  engineers salaries and benefits and other operational costs

operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company believes that operating income before depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation is viewed as a relevant supplemental measure of performance in the cellular telephone industry 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating results for the year ended december  reflect the continued improvement in operating cash flow ebitda  subscriber growth and the related increase in penetration  a slight decrease in the average revenue per subscriber arpu and the continuation of strong cost controls which translate to a low average operating cost per subscriber 
revenue 
service revenues totaled approximately million for the current year compared to approximately million for or an increase of 
the increase is principally a result of the greater amount of access revenue million due to the increase in the average number of post paid subscribers  as well as increases in toll revenue million  feature revenue million and prepaid airtime revenue million 
the increase in toll revenue is primarily due to the increase in the number of minutes used by post paid subscribers an increase of million minutes which per subscriber increased from minutes per post paid subscriber in to minutes in despite the increase in minutes of use  airtime revenue was flat as the company s rate plans provided larger amounts of free minutes than in the past in order to remain competitive in its markets 
as a result of increased competition for additional post paid cellular subscribers  the company s local revenue per cellular subscriber decreased slightly from in to in in addition  the company s outcollect roaming revenue  which is revenue that the company derives from other cellular companies subscribers roaming in our markets  increased by  as a result of an increase in usage from million minutes in to million minutes in  partially offset by reduced reimbursement rates from the other carriers 
the company expects this trend to continue as a result of new roaming rates negotiated with some of the company s roaming partners as well as the increased number of wireless carriers in each market which can be utilized by other carriers 
equipment and installation revenue amounted to million for the current year compared to million in the increase in equipment revenue of is primarily a combination of a greater number of gross pre and post paid subscriber additions  increase over as well as a greater emphasis on accessory sales to new subscribers

the net cost of incollect roaming  which represents the difference between the amount paid to other cellular carriers for the company s subscribers roaming in other carriers markets and the amount charged to these subscribers  variable network costs such as inter trunk  long distance and directory assistance costs  and engineering costs which consist principally of salaries and related fringe benefits  fixed span line costs and tower rentals 
as a result of negotiations with other cellular carriers see comments above concerning outcollect revenue  the company was able to reduce the amount it reimburses those carriers for incollect roaming resulting in net incollect revenue of million for the current year compared to a net cost of million for this reduction was augmented by decreased long distance and directory assistance costs resulting from renegotiated rates 
partially offsetting these cost savings  were increases in variable telephone costs such as interconnect and reverse toll charges as well as the direct cost of prepaid usage due to the increase in prepaid revenue and the implementation of a new prepaid software system 
decreases in engineering salaries and related expenses were offset by increases in fixed span line costs and additional cell site rental costs as the company continued to build out its system by adding new cell sites and increasing the number of radios in the existing cell sites 
the increase in gross subscriber additions combined with the increase in cellular phone upgrades as well as the higher cost of digital phones  resulted in an increase of the cost of equipment sold from million in to million in in addition  increases in the sale of accessories contributed to the increase

offsetting these savings were increases in long distance  directory assistance and interconnect costs related to the increased utilization of the system which is evidenced by a increase in minutes of use 
decreases in engineering salaries and related expenses  were offset by increases in fixed span line costs million and additional cell site rents million as the company continued to build out its system by adding new cell sites and increasing the number of radios in the existing cell sites 
the increase in gross subscriber additions combined with the increase in cellular phone upgrades as well as the higher cost of digital phones  resulted in an increase of the cost of equipment from million in to million in in addition  increases in the sale of accessories contributed to the increase in equipment cost

for financial reporting purposes  the company consolidates each subsidiary and partnership in which it has a controlling interest greater than in each 
year impact during the year ended december  the company did not experience any significant problems related to the year conversion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company generally utilizes fixed debt to fund its acquisitions 
management believes that the use of fixed rate debt minimizes the company s exposure to market conditions and the ensuing increases and decreases that could arise with variable rate financing
