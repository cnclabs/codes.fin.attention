the discussion and analysis below is limited to the company s continuing operations and includes the us distribution business 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  the company s net sales decreased from  in to  for the year ended december  net sales for include  generated by the canadian distribution business 
this decrease resulted from sales declines of and for the us and canadian distribution businesses  respectively 
the decrease in net sales for these businesses was due to a number of factors 
the decrease experienced in the first part of primarily resulted from restructuring activities during the first half of the first quarter and from decreased customer orders in reaction to merisel s price changes implemented in the latter half of the first quarter 
the decline in sales contributed to excess inventory positions resulting in a delay in some vendor payments while inventory levels were reduced to be in line with the lower sales levels 
these circumstances  combined with vendor concern caused by the bankruptcy filings of three major distributors during the first half of  contributed to a significant loss of vendor credit support 
this loss of credit support affected the company s ability to obtain sufficient inventory in the us distribution business  which significantly reduced product availability and caused further declines in sales for the us distribution business  leading to the ultimate decision to wind down the us distribution business 
management believes that the sales decline experienced by the canadian distribution business resulted primarily from management s need to focus on problems in the us distribution business and diminished vendor credit support  due primarily to heightened vendor concerns regarding the us business  and related product availability challenges 
revenues for the optisel business for were  all of which were generated by the moca transition services agreement

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased from of sales in to for the same period in  due primarily to reduced sales volumes in relation to fixed costs 
during the third quarter of  the company announced a restructuring plan that would significantly reduce its facilities and workforce 
as a result  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  in the third quarter of in december the company determined that  primarily as a result of a significant contraction in sales and continuing substantial operating losses  the us distribution business would focus solely on software licensing and that the balance of the us distribution business would be wound down

consolidated net income the company reported net income of  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss of  or loss per share  in variability of quarterly results and seasonality historically  the industry in which the company operates has experienced variability in its net sales and operating margins on a quarterly basis and expects these patterns to continue in the future with respect to its canadian distribution and us software licensing businesses 
management believes that the factors influencing quarterly variability include i the overall growth in the computer industry  ii shifts in short term demand for the company s products resulting  in part  from the introduction of new products or updates to existing products  iii intensity of price competition among the company and its competitors as influenced by various factors  and iv the fact that virtually all sales in a given quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
due to the factors noted above  as well as the dynamic qualities of the computer products distribution industry  the company s revenues and earnings may be subject to material volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis  and the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of results for a full fiscal year 
additionally  in canada  the company s net sales in the first and fourth quarters have been historically higher than in its other two quarters 
management believes that the pattern of higher first and fourth quarter sales is partially explained by buying patterns of canadian government agencies in the first quarter and customer buying patterns relating to calendar year end business and holiday purchases in the fourth quarter 
as a result of this pattern  the company s working capital requirements in the fourth quarter have typically been greater than other quarters 
the company expects that it would also experience this type of seasonality in its optisel business

with respect to the company s canadian distribution business  in the opinion of management  anticipated cash from operations in  together with trade credit from vendors and borrowings under merisel canada s revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet merisel canada s requirements for the next months  without the need for additional financing or cash contributions from merisel americas 
those requirements include anticipated capital expenditures of less than cdn  during this assumes  however  that there are not material adverse changes in merisel canada s relationships with its vendors  customers or lenders 
any unforeseen event that adversely impacts the industry or merisel canada s position in the industry could have a direct and material unfavorable effect on the liquidity of merisel canada 
with respect to the company s us operations  the company has obligations relating to the wind down of the us distribution business in addition to working capital and capital expenditure requirements related to its software licensing and optisel businesses

a large portion of those expenditures will be made in the company presently anticipates that capital expenditures for its optisel and software licensing businesses will be between million and million for management believes that  with its current cash  expected revenues and cash flow from us operations  and its ability to reduce operating expenses  it has sufficient liquidity for the next months

asset management merisel s canadian distribution business attempts to manage its inventory position to maintain levels sufficient to achieve high product availability and same day order fill rates 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due to factors including increases or decreases in sales levels  special term large volume purchases  and the addition of new manufacturers and products 
the distribution agreements entered into between the company and its vendors generally provide merisel with stock balancing and price protection provisions that partially reduce merisel s risk of loss due to slow moving inventory  supplier price reductions  product updates or obsolescence 
stock balancing provisions typically give the distributor the right to return for credit or exchange for other products a portion of the inventory items purchased  within a designated period of time  but are not generally provided by the major pc systems manufacturers 
under price protection provisions  suppliers will credit the distributor for declines in inventory value resulting from the supplier s price reductions if the distributor complies with certain conditions 
in the past few years  certain major pc manufacturers have reduced the availability of price protection for distributors 
through buying procedures and controls to manage inventory purchases  the company seeks to reduce future potential adverse impact from these changes while balancing the need to maintain sufficient levels of inventory 
there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in the future in preventing a material adverse effect on the company 
the company offers credit terms to qualifying customers and also sells on a prepay  early pay  credit card and cash on delivery basis
