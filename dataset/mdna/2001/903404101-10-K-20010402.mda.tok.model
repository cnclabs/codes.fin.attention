selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth certain unaudited financial data for the eight quarters in the period ended december  this data has been derived from unaudited financial statements that  in the opinion of our management  include all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information when read in conjunction with our annual audited financial statements and the notes thereto 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior quarters to conform with current quarter presentations 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands except per share data net sales     gross profit     net loss     net loss attributable to common stockholders   loss per share basic and diluted 



quarter ended march  june  september  december  in thousands except per share data net sales     gross profit     net loss     loss per share basic and diluted 



in the quarter ended march  net revenues increased approximately million from the preceding quarter primarily due to increased advertising impressions and improvements to our website designed to generate additional sales from each customer 
revenue reductions in the quarters ended june  and december  were primarily due to reductions in advertising impressions 
in the quarter ended september  net revenues increased by approximately million from the preceding quarter due to an increase in internet transactions which resulted from increased web site visitor traffic 
in the quarter ended december  revenues declined primarily due to the seasonal factors in which the rise in consumer online holiday shopping directed attention away from our online services 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may significantly fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include fluctuations in the cost of television  radio  print and internet based advertising  for example  television advertising prices are generally higher during the last quarter of calendar year due to the seasonal trends in programming and consumer viewing patterns  the inability to maintain or develop relationships with  or continue advertising on  various key internet companies and popular web sites 
delays and costs associated with unsuccessful service introductions  seasonal patterns of internet usage  for example  the increase in the percentage of online users shopping for gifts during the fourth quarter  service interruption  delays and costs relating to expansion of our networking infrastructure and facilities  for example  we have experienced system interruptions in the past as well as slower response times during periods of high calling volume  loss of one or more of our database providers  and anticipating and responding to the introduction of new or enhanced services by our competitors  or more generally to increase demand for our services  for example  we reduced the price of our internet based services in december to further increase demand for these services 
our business depends largely on our ability to attract new clients through television and internet based advertising as well as other marketing efforts 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses are based on advertising commitments on television programming and internet directories and web sites 
many of our advertising arrangements are non cancelable fixed term contracts 
as a result  a substantial portion of our expenses in any given period is fixed and based in part on expectations of future revenue and advertising and sales productivity 
we may be unable to generate enough revenues following this advertising to offset the related cost 
we may also be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
from time to time  demand for our services following television or internet based advertising has exceeded our infrastructure and operational capacity and we were slow or unable to respond to client demand for our services 
when these events occurred  we may have lost clients and our reputation may have been damaged 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents have decreased to million excluding million of restricted cash pledged as collateral principally in connection with our building lease from million at december  primarily as a result of continuing operating losses 
cash used in operations increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to reduced gross profits and increased general and administrative expenses relating to the hiring of executive personnel and the development of information technology infrastructure 
cash used in investing activities increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increased purchases of computer hardware and software and development of our website 
cash provided by financing activities decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in we received approximately million of net proceeds in connection with the sale of convertible preferred stock and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we received approximately million as the net proceeds of our initial public offering in  million under convertible notes issued to kushner locke  and million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued to kushner locke 
partially offsetting these amounts was the repayment to kushner locke of million plus interest  repayment of approximately million related to our line of credit and other notes payable and the pledging of restricted cash of million as collateral for our new building lease 
since inception we have experienced negative cash flow from operations and expect to continue to experience significant negative cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future 
we have a working capital deficit of  as of december  we currently believe that our existing capital resources including the aggregate net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in february and march  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
no assurance is given that we will not be required to raise additional financing prior to that time 
furthermore  there is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  the financing will be on favorable terms 
if the financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations
