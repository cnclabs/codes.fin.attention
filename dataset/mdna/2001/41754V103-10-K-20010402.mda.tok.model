item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business general benton oil and gas company is an independent energy company which has been engaged in the development and production of oil and gas properties since we have developed significant interests in venezuela and russia  and have acquired certain less significant interests in other parts of the world 
our producing operations are conducted principally through our percent owned venezuelan subsidiary  benton vinccler  ca  which operates the south monagas unit in venezuela  and geoilbent ltd  a russian limited liability company of which we own percent  which operates the north gubkinskoye field in west siberia  russia 
additionally  we own percent of the equity interest in arctic gas company  of which percent was subject to restrictions on transfer and percent was not subject to restrictions on transfer  as of december  arctic gas was formed to explore and develop the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks in the west siberian basin of russia 
we have expanded into projects which involve exploration components  such as opportunities in china  through our acquisition of the wab exploration block and the molino oil and natural gas project in california 
as of december   we had total estimated proved reserves net of minority interest of mmboe  and a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow  before income taxes  for total proved reserves of million 
of these totals  the south monagas unit represented mmbbls and million  geoilbent represented mmbbls and million  and arctic gas represented mmboe and million 
as of december   we had total assets of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  cash flows from operations  before working capital changes  of million  ebitda of million and long term debt of million 
for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million  cash flows from operations  before working capital changes  of million  ebitda of million and long term debt of million 
we currently have significant debt principal obligations payable in million and million 
our debt service requirements may restrict our ability to fund capital expenditures necessary to maximize the value of our assets 
the debt levels may restrict our ability to borrow additional monies to fund asset growth or to provide financial flexibility 
additionally  our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance and crude oil and natural gas realizations 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of an equity offering 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
management  operational and financial restrictions as a result of benton s increased leverage and poor investment returns since  our equity and public debt values have eroded significantly 
in order to effectuate the changes necessary to restore our financial flexibility and to enhance our ability to execute a viable strategic plan aimed at creating new stockholder value  we undertook several significant actions beginning in  including hired a new president and chief executive officer  a new senior vice president and chief financial officer and a new vice president and general counsel  reconstituted our board of directors with industry executives with proven experience in oil and natural gas operations  finance and international operations  redefined our strategic priorities to focus on value creation  initiated capital conservation steps and financial transactions to de leverage the company and improve cash flow for reinvestment  undertook a comprehensive study of our core venezuelan asset to attempt to enhance the value of its production  thus ultimately increasing cash flow and potentially extending its productive life 
we continue to aggressively explore means by which to maximize stockholder value 
we believe that we possess significant producing properties in venezuela which have yet to be optimized and valuable unexploited acreage in venezuela and russia 
the intrinsic value of our assets is burdened by a heavy debt load and constraints on capital to further exploit such opportunities 
therefore  we  with the advice of our financial and legal advisors  are conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  selling all or part of our existing assets in venezuela and russia  debt restructuring  some combination thereof  or the sale of the company 
however  no assurance can be given that any of these steps can be successfully completed or that we ultimately will determine that any of these steps should be taken 
operating strategy our long term strategy is to identify and access large resources of hydrocarbons in underexploited areas around the world that can be developed at low overall finding and operating costs and converted into proved reserves  production and value 
to achieve this strategy  we must restore our financial flexibility by restructuring our balance sheet  exploit our core assets in venezuela and russia  and seek and exploit new oil and natural gas reserves 
with respect to our core venezuelan assets  we intend to maximize the value of production at the south monagas unit  rather than increase production at any cost 
as part of our strategic shift in focus on the value of the barrels produced  we suspended the development drilling program for a period of approximately six months starting in january during this period  with the assistance of alliance partner schlumberger  all aspects of operations are being thoroughly reviewed to integrate field performance to date with revised computer simulation modeling and improved well completion technology 
we expect the result will be a streamlined and more effective infill drilling and well workover program that is part of an overall reservoir management strategy to drain the remaining mmbbls mmbbls net to benton of proved reserves of oil in the fields 
our goal will be an accelerated development program with lower cost production  starting from the second half of  rising to an expected level of up to between  bbls of oil equivalent per day in less than two years 
this is based on current internal operating and financial assumptions and also assumes that we do not enter into a transaction under which we sell a significant portion of our assets  as described in item business management  operational and financial restrictions 
in the first half of  we will concentrate on improving the production from the existing available wells in venezuela 
we achieved our goal of  barrels of oil per day in early january and in february production rose to over  bbls of oil per day 
currently  production as of march  is  bbls of oil per day which is expected to decline to between  and  barrels of oil per day by mid year  then increase when the new development plan commences in the third quarter 
we expect to average approximately  bbls of oil per day for the first quarter of the venezuela capital budget includes million for the construction of a mile oil pipeline with a capacity of  bbls per day that will connect the tucupita field production facility with the uracoa central processing unit 
this is expected to reduce tucupita field operating costs over per bbl and improve the infrastructure network to allow the future  efficient development of the bombal field 
funding for construction of the pipeline was provided by two loans funded by a venezuelan bank in march totaling million 
the first loan  in the amount of million  bears interest payable monthly based on day libor plus percent with principal payable quarterly for years 
the second loan  in the amount of billion venezuelan bolivars million  bears interest payable monthly based on a mutually agreed interest rate determined quarterly or a bank average published by the central bank of venezuela 
the interest rate for the initial quarterly period is 
in russia  geoilbent produced an average of  bbls of oil per day in and is currently producing as of march   bbls of oil per day 
in  geoilbent will concentrate on increasing production  building a natural gas pipeline to take flared natural gas to market and improving profitability 
geoilbent is self funding and although it has not paid dividends to its shareholders in the past  the management of geoilbent has informed us that it expects to pay a dividend to its shareholders beginning in  including benton oil and gas company 
however  any such action by geoilbent would require the consent of at least one other geoilbent shareholder and may be subject to other regulatory and contractual restrictions 
our plan for arctic gas includes continuing to expand production of oil and condensate through the recompletion of existing wells  building facilities and pipelines to optimize delivery of liquids and initiating the production and sale of natural gas in we intend to seek long term contracts for oil  condensate and natural gas production in both export and domestic russian markets 
the goal at arctic gas is to preserve a controlling equity position and seek financial and technical partnerships to enable paced  large scale development of the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks 
over the long term  we intend to continue to seek and exploit new oil and natural gas reserves in current areas of interest while minimizing the associated financial and operating risks 
to reduce these risks  not only in seeking new reserves but also with respect to our existing operations  we focus our efforts in areas of low geologic risk we intend to focus our exploration and development activities only in areas of known  proven hydrocarbons 
use proven advanced technology in both exploration and development we use d seismic technology  which produces a three dimensional image of the earth s subsurface through the computer s interpretation of seismic data 
this technology provides a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than conventional surveys  which contributes significantly to field appraisal  development and production 
establish a local presence through joint venture partners and the use of local personnel we seek to establish a local presence in our areas of operation to facilitate stronger relationships with local government and labor 
in addition  using local personnel helps us to take advantage of local knowledge and experience and to minimize costs 
commit capital in a phased manner to limit total commitments at any one time we often agree to minimum capital expenditure or development commitments at the outset of new projects  but we endeavor to structure such commitments so that we can fulfill them over time  thereby limiting our initial cash outlay 
in pursuing new opportunities  we will seek to enter at an early stage and find investment partners at the point of maximum value in an effort to reduce our risk in any one venture 
we also will continue to assess project value regularly  preparing to monetize assets as opportunities arise 
operations the following table summarizes our proved reserves  drilling and production activity  and financial operating data by principal geographic area at and for each of the years ended december all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and petroleos de venezuela  sa under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela

these fields comprise the south monagas unit 
at that time  we were one of three foreign companies ultimately awarded an operating service agreement to reactivate existing fields by pdvsa 
we were the first us company since to be granted such an oil field development contract in venezuela 
the oil and natural gas operations in the south monagas unit are conducted by benton vinccler  our percent owned subsidiary 
the remaining percent of the outstanding capital stock of benton vinccler is owned by vinccler 
through our majority ownership of stock in benton vinccler  we make all operational and corporate decisions related to benton vinccler  subject to certain super majority provisions of benton vinccler s charter documents related to mergers  consolidations  sales of substantially all of its corporate assets  change of business  and similar major corporate events 
vinccler has an extensive operating history in venezuela 
it provided benton vinccler with initial financial assistance and significant construction services 
vinccler continues to provide ongoing assistance with governmental and labor relations 
under the terms of the operating service agreement  benton vinccler is a contractor for pdvsa 
benton vinccler is responsible for overall operations of the unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
in addition  pdvsa maintains full ownership of equipment and capital infrastructure following its installation 
benton vinccler invoices pdvsa each quarter based on barrels of oil accepted by pdvsa during the quarter  using quarterly adjusted contract service fees per barrel 
benton vinccler receives its payments from pdvsa in us dollars deposited directly into a us bank account 
the operating service agreement provides for benton vinccler to receive an operating fee for each barrel of crude oil delivered 
it also provides benton vinccler with the right to receive a capital recovery fee for certain of its capital expenditures  provided that such operating fee and capital recovery fee cannot exceed the maximum total fee per barrel set forth in the agreement 
the operating fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the special energy index of the us consumer price index 
the maximum total fee is subject to quarterly adjustments to reflect changes in the average of certain world crude oil prices 
currently  we are in discussions with pdvsa regarding the appropriate amount to pay for natural gas produced from the south monagas unit and used as fuel in benton vinccler s operations as well as other operating issues 
in december  we entered into agreements with schlumberger and helmerich payne to further develop the unit pursuant to a long term incentive based alliance program 
the alliance program includes the drilling of up to wells 
it provides for financial incentives for schlumberger and helmerich payne that are intended to reduce drilling costs  improve initial production rates of new wells  and increase the average life of the downhole pumps at south monagas 
as part of schlumberger s commitment to the program  it provides technical and engineering resources on site full time in venezuela and at our offices in carpinteria  california 
we drilled oil wells in as part of our strategic shift in focus on the value of the barrels produced  we suspended the development drilling program for a period of approximately six months starting in january during this period  with the assistance of alliance partner schlumberger  all aspects of operations are being thoroughly reviewed to integrate field performance to date with revised computer simulation modeling and improved well completion technology 
we expect the result will be a streamlined and more effective infill drilling and well workover program that is part of an overall reservoir management strategy to drain the remaining mmbbls mmbbls net to benton of proved reserves of oil in the fields 
our goal will be an accelerated development program with lower cost production  starting from the second half of  rising to an expected level of up to between  bbls of oil equivalent per day in less than two years 
this is based on current internal operating and financial assumptions and also assumes that we do not enter into a transaction under which we sell a significant portion of our assets  as described in item business management  operational and financial restrictions 
in the first half of  we will concentrate on improving the production from the existing available wells in venezuela 
production  currently as of march  at  bbls of oil per day in venezuela  is expected to decline to between  and  bbls of oil per day by mid year  then increase when the new development plan starts in the third quarter 
location and geology the unit extends across the southeastern part of the state of monagas and the southwestern part of the state of delta amacuro in eastern venezuela 
the unit is approximately miles long and eight miles wide and consists of  acres  of which the fields comprise approximately one half 
at december   proved reserves attributable to our venezuelan operations were  mbbls  mbbls net to benton 
this represented approximately percent of our proved reserves 
benton vinccler is primarily developing the oficina sands in the uracoa field 
the uracoa field contains percent of the unit s proved reserves 
benton vinccler has begun the development of the tucupita and bombal fields  which contain the remaining percent of the unit s reserves 
benton vinccler is currently reinjecting the associated natural gas produced at uracoa back into the reservoir 
we are currently in discussions with pdvsa to sell the natural gas  although there is no assurance that any natural gas contracts will result from the discussions 
drilling and development activity benton vinccler contracts with third parties for drilling and completion of wells 
in  we drilled wells 
uracoa field benton vinccler has been developing the unit since  beginning with the uracoa field 
during march through march  a total of approximately wells were producing an average of approximately  bbls of oil per day in the uracoa field 
the following table sets forth the uracoa field drilling activity and production information for each of the quarters presented wells drilled average daily vertical horizontal production from field bbls first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  production rates began to decline in the fourth quarter of due to a reduction in drilling activity  natural reservoir decline  and production related problems 
we ended drilling operations in the fourth quarter of because the initial development plan for the uracoa field was completed 
without continuous drilling  reservoirs like those at the uracoa field initially experience a sharp natural decline that decreases with time 
this initial sharp natural decline was aggravated during due to the impact of production problems we experienced on certain wells and the degradation of the local electrical power source 
we identified solutions to the electrical power and production related problems in  but the installation of electrical power generation facilities and remediation work on wells was required into additionally  we focused our efforts on the completion of a detailed geologic and reservoir simulation study during  which identified up to new infill and development well locations 
drilling resumed in the second half of  but we suspended it again in due to uncertainties in oil prices and cash flows 
we limited our capital expenditures during this period primarily to workovers and remediation activities 
in december  we entered into incentive based development alliance agreements with schlumberger and helmerich payne as part of our plans to resume development of the south monagas unit in venezuela 
during  we drilled oil wells in the uracoa field under the alliance agreements utilizing schlumberger s technical and engineering resources 
the geologic and reservoir simulation study indicated the viability of at least additional primary infill wells in the uracoa field 
many of these new locations are in underdeveloped sands where the model was used to optimize well spacing and location 
in the more developed areas of the field  we used the model to verify the economic viability of infill locations 
in the first quarter of  we began a comprehensive technical review of the south monagas unit that includes the completion of an extensive geologic and reservoir computer simulation study to optimize field management and the remaining development drilling program 
the computer simulation study will update and extend the study on a portion of the uracoa field to the entire south monagas unit 
it will incorporate all new geologic and reservoir information as well as the total production and drilling history from the more mature uracoa field and the underdeveloped tucupita and bombal fields 
we expect several benefits from the study including an optimum production profile of oil and gas  a revised water and natural gas injection strategy  more efficient development locations and improved well completion techniques 
since  we have reactivated previously drilled wells and drilled new wells in the uracoa field using modern drilling and completion techniques that had not previously been utilized on the field 
of the new wells drilled  a total of wells  or percent  have been completed and placed on production  four of which were converted to injection wells 
additionally  six injection wells have been drilled  two of which have been converted to producing wells 
we process the oil  water and natural gas we produce from the uracoa field in the uracoa central processing unit 
we ship the processed oil via pipeline to the pdvsa custody transfer point 
we treat and filter produced water  and then re inject it into the aquifer to assist the natural water drive 
we re inject natural gas into the natural gas cap for reservoir pressure maintenance 
the major components of this state of the art process facility were designed in the united states and installed by benton vinccler 
this process design is commonly used in heavy oil production in the united states  but was not previously used extensively in venezuela to process crude oil of similar gravity or quality 
the current production facility has capacity to handle mbbls of oil per day  mbbls of water per day  and mmcf of natural gas per day 
in august  benton vinccler sold its recently constructed power generation facility located in the uracoa field for million 
concurrently with the sale  benton vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
benton vinccler s capital expenditure budget includes drilling approximately wells at an estimated cost of million 
drilling additional wells will depend on the results of the current field development plan and reservoir computer study now underway  the results of the development drilling program and the availability of capital 
tucupita and bombal fields before becoming inactive in  the tucupita field had been substantially developed 
it had produced mmbbls of oil  mmbbls of water and bcf of natural gas 
benton vinccler drilled a successful pilot horizontal well in late to evaluate the remaining development potential of the tucupita field 
this well has produced mmbbls of oil at an average rate of  bbls of oil per day 
the early success of this pilot horizontal well led to the drilling of a second horizontal well in initial oil rates from the horizontal wells were encouraging  but water production soon increased sharply 
as a result  we changed the redevelopment strategy to include drilling deviated wells to allow for more effective water shut off 
during the second half of  we drilled five deviated infill wells to target undepleted portions of the field 
all five wells encountered high oil saturations  with an average initial production rate of bbls of oil per day 
additionally  we re activated nine wells  bringing production levels to  bbls of oil per day 
in  benton vinccler drilled a well on the west portion of the tucupita field to test the commercial viability of a previously undrilled fault block identified using d seismic data 
the well proved to be non commercial for oil production  however  we will investigate the natural gas potential of this well 
we are reinjecting produced water from tucupita into the aquifer to aid the natural water drive  and we have been flaring the associated natural gas 
however  this associated natural gas will be used to help generate electric power for the field in the first quarter of we are trucking the oil to the uracoa central processing unit where we process the oil and ship it by pipeline to the custody transfer point 
we have identified new well locations in undepleted portions of the tucupita field 
we anticipate additional viable wells once we complete a simulation study for tucupita 
moreover  our analysis of petrophysical and production data has revealed significant behind pipe recompletion potential in a deeper pay section that was not a primary target during the earlier development of the field 
currently  we have identified wells with recompletion potential for reactivation 
to date  we have drilled one well in the bombal field and reactivated another 
the bombal field is currently producing bbls of oil per day 
our future plans include drilling up to development wells and installing a processing facility to separate the oil  water and natural gas 
initially  we will re inject the water and natural gas back into the reservoir 
we are currently in discussions with pdvsa to sell the natural gas  although there are no assurances that gas contracts will result from these discussions 
as a result of our analysis of the potential in the tucupita field  and for environmental and safety reasons  we will begin construction of a million  mile   bbls per day capacity oil pipeline from tucupita to the uracoa central processing unit that we expect to complete in late once completed  we would also use the pipeline to transport oil from the bombal field after the construction of a connecting pipeline estimated to cost million 
currently  we are transporting crude oil by trucks from both tucupita and bombal 
a pipeline would significantly reduce our transportation costs from both fields and allow us to produce increased volumes of oil more economically 
customers and market information oil produced in venezuela is delivered to pdvsa under the terms of an operating service agreement for an operating service fee 
benton vinccler has constructed a mile oil pipeline from its oil processing facilities at uracoa to pdvsa s storage facility 
this is the custody transfer point 
the service agreement specifies that the oil stream may contain no more than percent base sediment and water 
quality measurements are conducted both at benton vinccler s facilities and at pdvsa s storage facility 
we are in the process of installing a continuous flow measuring unit at our facility so that we can closely monitor the quantities delivered to pdvsa 
pdvsa provides benton vinccler with a daily acknowledgment regarding the amount of oil accepted during the previous day 
at the end of each quarter  benton vinccler prepares an invoice to pdvsa for that quarter s deliveries 
pdvsa pays the invoice at the end of the second month after the end of the quarter 
invoice amounts and payments are denominated in us dollars 
payments are wire transferred into benton vinccler s account in a commercial bank in the united states 
natural gas produced by benton vinccler is currently re injected or used for operations  although discussions to sell the natural gas to pdvsa have been initiated 
there are no assurances that natural gas contracts will result from these discussions 
employees  community relations benton vinccler seeks to employ nationals rather than bring expatriates into the country 
presently  there are six full time expatriates working with benton vinccler and local employees 
benton vinccler also has conducted community relations programs  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies  and support for local schools  in both states in which the unit is located 
north gubkinskoye  russia geoilbent general in december  the joint venture agreement forming geoilbent was registered with the ministry of finance of the ussr 
geoilbent s ownership is as follows benton owns percent  purneftegazgeologia owns percent  and purneftegaz owns percent 
in november  the agreement was registered with the russian agency for international cooperation and development 
geoilbent was later re chartered as a limited liability company 
we believe that we have developed a good relationship with our co founding shareholders and have not experienced any disagreements on major operational matters 
geoilbent may only take action through a percent majority vote of its shareholders 
location and geology geoilbent develops  produces and markets crude oil from the north gubkinskoye field in the west siberia region of russia  located approximately  miles northeast of moscow 
the field covers a license block of  acres  an area approximately miles long and four miles wide 
the field has been delineated with over exploratory wells  which tested separate reservoirs 
it is surrounded by large proven fields 
the field is a large anticlinal structure with multiple pay sands 
the development to date has focused on the bp    and reservoirs with minor development in the bp and reservoirs 
geoilbent is currently flaring the produced natural gas in accordance with environmental regulations  although it is exploring alternatives to market the natural gas 
geoilbent also holds rights to three more license blocks comprising  acres 
drilling and development activity geoilbent commenced initial operations in the field during the third quarter of with the construction of a mile oil pipeline and installation of temporary production facilities 
during march through march  approximately wells were producing an average of approximately  bbls of oil per day 
the following table sets forth drilling activity and production information for each of the quarters presented average daily wells drilled production from field bbls first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  production was constrained in the first quarter of due to damage to production facilities resulting from a fire 
geoilbent contracts with third parties for drilling and completion of wells 
to date  previously drilled wells have been reactivated and wells have been drilled in the field 
a total of wells  or percent  have been completed and placed on production  of which were converted to water injection wells 
each well is drilled to an average measured depth of approximately  feet and an average true vertical depth of  feet 
the current production facilities are operating at or near capacity and will need to be expanded to accommodate production increases 
geoilbent transports oil produced from the north gubkinskoye field to production facilities constructed and owned by geoilbent 
it then transfers the oil to geoilbent s mile pipeline which transports the oil from the north gubkinskoye field south to the main russian oil pipeline network 
geoilbent has obtained financing through a million parallel loan facility for the development of the north gubkinskoye field from the european bank for reconstruction and development and the international moscow bank 
a total of million has been advanced to date from the loan facility 
geoilbent has a budget which includes capital expenditures of approximately million  of which million would be used to drill wells in the north gubkinskoye field and million would be used for construction of production and other facilities 
its budget also includes million for principal payments on the loan facility 
this budget is expected to be funded from geoilbent s cash flow from operations 
customers and market information geoilbent s mile pipeline runs from the field to the main pipeline in the area where geoilbent transfers the oil to transneft  the state oil pipeline monopoly 
transneft then transports the oil to the western border of russia for export sales or to various domestic locations for non export sales 
trading companies such as rosneffegasexport handle all export oil sales 
all export sales have been paid in us dollars into geoilbent s account in moscow 
domestic sales are paid in russian rubles 
during  geoilbent sold approximately percent of its production in the export market and percent in the domestic market 
employees  community and country relations geoilbent employs russian nationals almost exclusively 
presently  there are two full time expatriates working with geoilbent and local employees 
we have conducted community relations programs  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies in towns in which geoilbent personnel reside and also for the nomadic indigenous population which reside in the area of oilfield operations 
east urengoy  russia arctic gas company general arctic gas company  formerly severneftegaz  was formed in as a private company to explore and develop the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks 
the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks are located within the west siberian basin  the world s largest sedimentary basin  which contains nearly one third of the world s proved and probable natural gas reserves 
both license blocks occur on the eastern flank of the giant urengoy natural gas field  which currently produces hydrocarbons from cenomanian reservoirs 
under the terms of agreements signed in april  we acquired a percent interest in arctic gas in return for providing or arranging up to million of credit financing for the project 
our agreements impose restrictions on the sale and transfer of these shares subject to disbursements under the credit financing and provide that for every million of credit made available  percent of the interest will be released from the restrictions 
as of december   we had provided million of credit  all of which had been applied to the release of restrictions on the shares 
as a result  we had earned the right to remove restrictions from shares representing an approximate percent equity interest 
from through december  we separately purchased shares representing an additional percent equity interest not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions 
including the additional purchased shares  as of december   we owned a total of percent of the voting shares of arctic gas  of which percent was not subject to restrictions 
the following table summarizes our ownership interests of arctic gas company as of december  shares released from restrictions additional purchased shares total shares not subject to restrictions shares subject to restrictions total ownership location and geology the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks comprise  acres and are situated approximately miles north of geoilbent in the yamal nenets autonomous region of russia 
the towns and communities of novy urengoy  samburg  urengoy and nyda are located near the two licenses 
extensive exploration drilling and testing over wells on the samburg and yevo yakha licenses has resulted in the discovery of major resources of natural gas  condensate and oil 
the primary reservoirs of these fields are currently being produced in both the adjacent urengoy field and rospan block 
historic production at the urengoy field is now on decline  and the undeveloped reserves discovered on the adjacent arctic gas and rospan blocks may be of interest to gazprom and russia as replacement for the production that is being lost at urengoy 
drilling and development activity arctic gas has reactivated six previously drilled oil wells through march  we are trucking oil to storage facilities where it is collected for sale 
arctic gas is currently producing approximately  bbls of oil per day 
the following table sets forth reactivation activity and production information for each of the quarters presented average daily wells reactivated production from field bbls fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter  fourth quarter  arctic gas is currently planning for a samburg oil and natural gas pilot development project 
the pilot project calls for drilling new wells  installing natural gas processing facilities  and connecting into the export pipeline system 
the arctic gas blocks are located in the heart of the urengoy yamburg producing and support infrastructure region and are well situated for development 
natural gas export trunklines are located kilometers from the blocks 
arctic gas and gazprom have entered into preliminary agreements to allow access to existing oil  liquids and natural gas pipelines and facilities that could potentially result in product sales to domestic and export markets 
arctic gas is in discussions with various parties concerning the export of natural gas  although there are no assurances that contracts will result from these discussions 
gazprom has granted arctic gas access to its transportation system beginning in the third quarter of for natural gas sales from the blocks to certain customers in the former soviet union 
further development activities are subject to the pace and scope of arctic gas s internally generated funds and to our ability to provide or arrange further funding 
employees  community and country relations arctic gas is a russian company that employs russian nationals almost exclusively 
presently  there are two full time expatriates working with arctic gas and local employees 
we have conducted community relations programs in russia  providing medical care  training  equipment and supplies in towns in which arctic gas personnel reside and also for the nomadic indigenous population which reside in the area of oilfield operations 
wab  south china sea benton offshore china company general in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  a privately held company headquartered in denver  colorado  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with conoco inc the dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
china s claim of ownership of the area results from china s discovery  use and historic administration of the area 
this claim also includes third party and official foreign government recognition of china s sovereignty and jurisdiction over the contract area 
despite this claim  the territorial dispute may not be resolved in favor of china 
we cannot predict how or when  if at all  this dispute will be resolved or whether it would result in our interest being reduced 
location and geology the wab contract area is located approximately miles southeast of the dai hung big bear oil field 
the block is adjacent to british petroleum s giant natural gas discovery at lan tay red orchid and miles north of exxon s natuna discovery 
the contract area covers several similar structural trends  each with potential for hydrocarbon reserves in possible multiple pay zones 
the contract area is located northwest of zengmu basin offshore sarawak  where two chinese institutions have already conducted geophysical seismic surveys 
based on the multi disciplinary data available from zengmu basin to the southeast  east natuna basin to the south and southwest  and wan an con son basin to the west and northwest  there is substantial evidence of hydrocarbon potential in the contract area 
drilling and development activity due to the sovereignty issues  we have been unable to pursue an exploration program during phase one of the contract 
as a result  we have obtained extensions  with the current extension in effect until june we expect extensions to continue to be available to us 
china and vietnam are now engaged in discussions to resolve the territorial dispute  although there is no certainty of timing or the outcome of such discussions 
once there has been a resolution of the disputes  an exploration program will commence including the acquisition of d seismic data as required by the petroleum contract with cnooc 
domestic operations in march  we acquired a percent participation interest in three california state offshore oil and natural gas leases california leases from molino energy company  llc molino energy  which held percent of these leases 
the project area covers the molino  gaviota and caliente fields  located approximately miles west of santa barbara  california 
in consideration of the percent participation interest in the california leases  we became the operator of the project 
we agreed to pay percent of the first million and percent of the remainder of the costs of the first well drilled on the block 
during  we drilled the exploratory well to the gaviota anticline 
drill stem tests proved to be inconclusive or non commercial  and we temporarily abandoned the well for further evaluation 
in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire molino energy s interest in the california leases in exchange for the release of its joint interest billing obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to focus our capital expenditures on existing producing properties and fulfilling work commitments associated with our other properties 
because we had no firm approved plans to continue drilling on the california leases and the exploratory well did not result in commercial reserves  we wrote off all of the capitalized costs associated with the california leases of million and the joint interest receivable of million due from molino energy at december  in april  we entered into a retainer agreement  and in may an exploration agreement  with coastline energy corporation 
the purpose of these agreements was to acquire  explore and develop oil and natural gas prospects both onshore and in the state waters of the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana and mississippi 
under the agreements  coastline will evaluate prospects in the gulf coast area for possible acquisition and development by us 
during the month term of the exploration agreement  we will reimburse coastline for certain of its overhead and prospect evaluation costs 
under the agreements  for prospects evaluated by coastline that we acquire  coastline will receive compensation based on oil and natural gas production acquired or developed  and the profits  if any  resulting from the sale of such prospects 
in april  pursuant to the agreements  we acquired an approximate percent working interest in the east lawson field in acadia parish  louisiana 
the acquisition included a percent working interest in two producing oil and natural gas wells 
during the year ended december   our share of the east lawson field production was  bbls of oil and  mcf of natural gas  resulting in income from united states oil and natural gas operations of million 
in december  we sold our interest in the east lawson field for million cash and a percent carried working interest in up to four wells that may be drilled in the future 
reserves estimates of our proved reserves as of december  were prepared by ryder scott company  lp  independent petroleum engineers 
in prior years  reserve estimates were prepared by us and audited by huddleston co  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
the following table sets forth information regarding estimates of proved reserves at december  the venezuelan information includes reserve information net of a percent deduction for the minority interest in benton vinccler 
all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
although we estimate that there are substantial natural gas reserves in the benton vinccler properties in venezuela and the license blocks held by geoilbent  no natural gas reserves have been recorded as of december  because of a lack of sales and or transportation contracts in place 
natural gas proved reserves have been recognized for arctic gas  which has transportation and marketing contracts in place 
geoilbent and benton vinccler are currently considering alternatives to market the natural gas 
net crude oil and condensate mbbls proved proved developed undeveloped total venezuela    geoilbent    arctic gas    total    net natural gas mmcf proved proved developed undeveloped total arctic gas    based on percent ownership not subject to restrictions as of december estimates of commercially recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of the future net cash flows derived therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the subject properties  comparison with other producing properties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  export tariffs  abandonment costs  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are to some degree speculative  and various classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of speculation involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the commercially recoverable reserves of oil attributable to any particular property or group of properties  the classification  cost and risk of recovering such reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
the difficulty of making precise estimates is accentuated by the fact that percent of our total proved reserves were undeveloped as of december  therefore  the following costs will likely vary from our estimates and such variances may be material actual production  oil sales  severance and excise taxes  export tariffs  development expenditures  workover and remedial expenditures  abandonment expenditures  and operating expenditures 
reserve estimates are not constrained by the availability of the capital resources required to finance the estimated development and operating expenditures 
in addition  actual future net cash flows will be affected by factors such as actual production  supply and demand for oil  availability and capacity of gathering systems and pipelines  changes in governmental regulations or taxation  and the impact of inflation on costs 
the timing of actual future net oil sales from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value  can be affected by the timing of the incurrence of expenditures in connection with development of oil and gas properties 
the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate present value for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry 
discounted present value  no matter what discount rate is used  is materially affected by assumptions as to the amount and timing of future production  which assumptions may and often do prove to be inaccurate 
for the period ending december   we reported million of discounted future net cash flows before income taxes from proved reserves based on the sec s required calculations 
production  prices and lifting cost summary in the following table we have set forth by country our net production  average sales prices and average lifting costs for the years ended december   and the presentation for venezuela includes percent of the production  without deduction for minority interest 
geoilbent percent ownership and arctic gas percent  percent and percent ownership not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions at december  and  respectively  which are accounted for under the equity method  have been included at their respective ownership interest in the consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal period ending september and  accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december   and reflect results from geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and from arctic gas for the twelve months ended september  years ended december  venezuela net crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl geoilbent average crude oil production bbls    average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl arctic gas net crude oil production bbls  average crude oil sales price per bbl average lifting costs per bbl regulation general our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by price controls  limitations on oil and natural gas production  tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  o changes in such laws  and changes in administrative regulations and the interpretation and application of such rules and regulations 
in addition  various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and costs 
in any country in which we may do business  the oil and natural gas industry legislation and agency regulation is periodically changed for a variety of political  economic  environmental and other reasons 
numerous governmental departments and agencies issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry  some of which carry substantial penalties for the failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business 
venezuela venezuela requires environmental and other permits for certain operations conducted in oil field development  such as site construction  drilling  and seismic activities 
as a contractor to pdvsa  benton vinccler submits capital and operating budgets to pdvsa for approval 
capital expenditures to comply with venezuelan environmental regulations relating to the reinjection of natural gas in the field and water disposal were million in and are expected to be million in benton vinccler also submits requests for permits for drilling  seismic and operating activities to pdvsa  which then obtains such permits from the ministry of energy and mines and ministry of environment  as required 
benton vinccler is also subject to income  municipal and value added taxes  and must file certain monthly and annual compliance reports to the national tax administration and to various municipalities 
russia geoilbent and arctic gas submit annual production and development plans  which include information necessary for permits and approvals for their planned drilling  seismic and operating activities  to local and regional governments and to the ministry of fuel and energy and the ministry of natural resources 
they also submit annual production targets and quarterly export nominations for oil pipeline transportation capacity to the ministry of fuel and energy 
geoilbent and arctic gas are subject to customs  value added  and municipal and income taxes 
various municipalities and regional tax inspectorates are involved in the assessment and collection of these taxes 
geoilbent and arctic gas must file operating and financial compliance reports with several agencies  including the ministry of fuel and energy  ministry of natural resources  committee for technical mining monitoring and the state customs committee 
russian companies are subject to a statutory income tax rate of up to percent and are subject to various other tax burdens and tariffs 
excise  pipeline and other tariffs and taxes continue to be levied on all oil producers and certain exporters  including an oil export tariff that increased to euros per ton approximately per barrel on november  from euros per ton in we are unable to predict the impact of taxes  duties and other burdens in the future for our russian operations 
drilling  acquisition and finding costs from commencement of operations through december   we added  net of production and property sales  approximately mmboe of proved reserves through purchases of reserves in place  discoveries of oil and natural gas reserves  extensions of existing producing fields and revisions of previously estimated reserves  for which the finding costs were per boe 
our estimate of future development costs for our undeveloped proved reserves at december  was per boe 
the estimated future development costs are based upon our anticipated cost of developing our non producing proved reserves  which costs are calculated using historical costs for similar activities 
for acquisitions of leases and producing properties  development and exploratory drilling  production facilities and additional development activities such as workovers and recompletions  we spent approximately excluding our share of capital expenditures incurred by equity affiliates million during  million during  and million during we have drilled or participated in the drilling of wells as follows years ended december  gross net gross net gross net wells drilled exploratory crude oil natural gas dry holes development crude oil natural gas dry holes total average depth of wells feet    producing wells crude oil natural gas the information related to producing wells reflects wells we drilled  wells we participated in drilling and producing wells we acquired

competition we encounter strong competition from major oil and gas companies and independent operators in acquiring properties and leases for exploration for crude oil and natural gas 
the principal competitive factors in the acquisition of such oil and gas properties include the staff and data necessary to identify  investigate and purchase such leases  and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop such leases 
many of our competitors have financial resources  staffs and facilities substantially greater than ours 
employees and consultants at december   we had full time employees  augmented from time to time with independent consultants  as required 
benton vinccler had employees  geoilbent had employees and arctic gas had employees 
title to developed and undeveloped acreage all venezuelan reserves are attributable to an operating service agreement between benton vinccler and pdvsa  under which all mineral rights are owned by the government of venezuela 
with regard to russian acreage  geoilbent and arctic gas have obtained certain documentation from appropriate regulatory agencies in russia which we believe is adequate to establish their right to develop  produce and market oil and natural gas from their fields 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for another million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with conoco inc the territorial dispute has existed for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
it is uncertain when or how this dispute will be resolved  and under what terms the various countries and parties to the agreements may participate in the resolution  although certain proposed economic solutions currently under discussion would result in our interest being reduced 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we make a limited review of title to farmout acreage and to undeveloped us oil and natural gas leases upon execution of the contracts and leases 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a thorough drillsite title examination is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects 
we follow the practice of obtaining title opinions on our domestic producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to such properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry 
our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens for current taxes  and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect the value of such properties

exploratory well 
an exploratory well is a well drilled in search of a new and as yet undiscovered pool of oil or natural gas  or to extend the known limits of a field under development 
finding cost 
finding cost  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of total capital expenditures related to acquisitions  exploration and development costs reduced by proceeds for any sale of oil and gas properties by the amount of total net reserves added or reduced as a result of property acquisitions and sales  drilling activities and reserve revisions during the same period 
future development cost 
future development cost of proved nonproducing reserves  expressed in dollars per boe  is calculated by dividing the amount of future capital expenditures related to development properties by the amount of total proved non producing reserves associated with such activities 
gross acres or wells 
gross acres or wells are the total acres or wells  as the case may be  in which an entity has an interest  either directly or through an affiliate 
lifting costs 
lifting costs are the expenses of lifting oil from a producing formation to the surface  consisting of the costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  including labor costs  repair and maintenance  supplies  insurance  production  severance and windfall profit taxes 
net acres or wells 
a party s net acres or net wells are calculated by multiplying the number of gross acres of gross wells in which that party has an interest by the fractional interest of the party in each such acre or well 
producing properties or reserves 
producing reserves are proved developed reserves expected to be produced from existing completion intervals now open for production in existing wells 
producing properties are properties to which producing reserves have been assigned by an independent petroleum engineer 
proved developed reserves 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  that is  on the basis of prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made and any price changes provided for by existing conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves 
reserves means crude oil and natural gas  condensate and natural gas liquids  which are net of leasehold burdens  are stated on a net revenue interest basis  and are found to be commercially recoverable 
royalty interest 
a royalty interest is an interest in an oil and gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production or the proceeds of the sale thereof free of the costs of production 
standardized measure of future net cash flows 
the standardized measure of future net cash flows is a method of determining the present value of proved reserves 
the future net oil sales from proved reserves are estimated assuming that oil and natural gas prices and production costs remain constant 
the resulting stream of oil sales is then discounted at the rate of percent per year to obtain a present value 
d seismic 
d seismic is the method by which a continuous three dimensional image of the earth s subsurface is created through the interpretation of seismic data 
d surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do conventional surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal  development and production 
d seismic 
d seismic is the method by which discreet two dimensional profiles of the earth s subsurface are interpreted and interpolated to provide a basic understanding of the subsurface 
undeveloped acreage 
undeveloped acreage is oil and natural gas acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit commercial production regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves

item legal proceedings on february   the wrt creditors liquidation trust filed suit in the united states bankruptcy court  western district of louisiana against us and benton oil and gas company of louisiana  aka ventures oil gas of louisiana 
the suit seeks a determination that the sale by bogla to tesla resources corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of wrt energy corporation  of certain west cote blanche bay properties for million  constituted a fraudulent conveyance under the bankruptcy code 
the alleged basis of the claim is that tesla was insolvent at the time of its acquisition of the properties  and that it paid a price in excess of the fair value of the property 
a trial commenced on may  that concluded at the end of august  and post trial briefs have been filed 
we believe that this case lacks merit and that an unfavorable outcome is unlikely 
in  and november  we made certain unsecured loans to our then chief executive officer  a 
e 
benton 
each of these loans was evidenced by a promissory note bearing interest at the rate of percent per annum 
at december   the aggregate outstanding amounts of the loans were million 
at september   the aggregate outstanding amounts of the loans were million 
in the fourth quarter of  we loaned mr 
benton an additional million 
the proceeds of the loan were to be used to pay in full certain margin account obligations owed to third parties which had obtained a pledge from mr 
benton of his shares of benton stock 
we then obtained a security interest in those shares of stock  certain personal real estate and proceeds from certain contractual and stock option agreements 
at december   the million owed to us by mr 
benton exceeded the value of our collateral  due to the decline in the price of benton stock 
as a result  we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
the portion of the note secured by benton stock and stock options  million  was presented on our balance sheet as a reduction from stockholders equity at december  in august  mr 
benton filed a chapter reoganization bankruptcy petition in the us bankruptcy court for the central district of california  in santa barbara  california 
we recorded an additional million allowance for doubtful accounts for the remaining principal and accrued interest owed to us at june   and continue to record additional allowances as interest accrues 
measuring the amount of the allowances requires judgments and estimates  and the amount eventually realized may differ from the estimate 
in february  we entered into a separation agreement and a consulting agreement with mr 
benton  pursuant to which we retained mr 
benton as an independent contractor to perform certain services for us 
mr 
benton agreed to propose a plan of reorganization in his bankruptcy case that provides for the repayment of our loans to him 
under the proposed plan  which we anticipate will be submitted to the bankruptcy court in the first half of  we will retain our security interest in mr 
benton s  shares of benton stock and in his stock options  and in a portion of certain proceeds of his consulting agreement 
repayment of any amounts of these loans by mr 
benton will be achieved through mr 
benton s liquidation of certain real and personal property assets  a phased liquidation of benton stock resulting from mr 
benton s exercise of his benton stock options  and  if necessary  from the retained interest in the portion of the consulting agreement s proceeds 
the amount we eventually realize and the timing of our receipt of payments will depend upon the timing and results of the liquidation of mr 
benton s assets  including benton oil and gas company stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management  operational and financial restrictions as a result of our increased leverage and poor investment returns since  our equity and public debt values have eroded significantly 
in order to effectuate the changes necessary to restore our financial flexibility and to enhance our ability to execute a viable strategic plan aimed at creating new stockholder value  we undertook several significant actions beginning in  including hired a new president and chief executive officer  a new senior vice president and chief financial officer and a new vice president and general counsel  reconstituted our board of directors with industry executives with proven experience in oil and natural gas operations  finance and international operations  redefined our strategic priorities to focus on value creation  initiated capital conservation steps and financial transactions to de leverage the company and improve cash flow for reinvestment  undertook a comprehensive study of our core venezuelan asset to attempt to enhance the value of its production  thus ultimately increasing cash flow and potentially extending its productive life 
we continue to aggressively explore means by which to maximize stockholder value 
we believe that we possess significant producing properties in venezuela which have yet to be optimized and valuable unexploited acreage in venezuela and russia 
the intrinsic value of our assets is burdened by a heavy debt load and constraints on capital to further exploit such opportunities 
therefore  we  with the advice of our financial and legal advisors  are conducting a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  selling all or part of our existing assets in venezuela and russia  debt restructuring  some combination thereof  or the sale of the company 
however  no assurance can be given that any of these steps can be successfully completed or that we ultimately will determine that any of these steps should be taken 
results of operations we include the results of operations of benton vinccler in our consolidated financial statements and reflect the percent ownership interest of vinccler as a minority interest 
we account for our investments in geoilbent and arctic gas using the equity method 
we include geoilbent and arctic gas in our consolidated financial statements based on a fiscal year ending september our results of operations reflect the results of geoilbent for the twelve months ended september   and  and the results of arctic gas for the twelve months ended september  and we follow the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
we capitalize all acquisition  exploration  and development costs incurred 
we account for our oil and gas properties using cost centers on a country by country basis 
we credit proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties to the full cost pools if the sales do not result in a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved property 
we amortize capitalized costs of oil and gas properties within the cost centers on an overall unit of production method using proved oil and gas reserves as audited or prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
costs that we amortize include all capitalized costs less accumulated amortization and impairment  the estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing proved reserves  and estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
you should read the following discussion of the results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  and the financial condition as of december  and in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have presented selected expense items from our consolidated income statement as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales in the following table years ended december  operating expenses depletion  depreciation and amortization general and administrative taxes other than on income interest years ended december  and our results of operations for the year ended december  primarily reflected the results for benton vinccler  ca in venezuela  which accounted for substantially all of our production and oil sales revenue 
as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower production from the south monagas unit  oil sales in venezuela were percent higher in compared with realized fees per barrel increased percent from in to in and oil sales quantities decreased percent from mmbbls of oil in to mmbbls of oil in 
our operating expenses from the south monagas unit increased percent primarily due to increased chemical treatment  electricity and natural gas compression station maintenance and operating costs  partially offset by reduced salaries and material costs 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december  the expenses we incurred during the period consisted of operating expenses of million  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense of million  write downs of oil and gas properties and impairments of million  general and administrative expense of million  taxes other than on income of million  interest expense of million  income tax expense of million  and minority interest of million 
other items of income consisted of investment income and other of million  net gain on exchange rates of million  equity in net earnings of affiliated companies of million  and extraordinary gain on the repurchase of long term notes of million 
our net income was million or per share diluted 
by comparison  we had revenues of million for the year ended december  the expenses we incurred during the period consisted of operating expenses of million  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense of million  write downs of oil and gas properties and impairments of million  general and administrative expense of million  taxes other than on income of million  interest expense of million  income tax benefit of million  and minority interest of million 
other items of income consisted of investment income and other of million  net gain on exchange rates of million  and equity in net earnings of affiliated companies of million 
our net loss was million or per share diluted 
our revenues increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to increased oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of increases in world crude oil prices  partially offset by lower sales quantities 
our sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared to mmbbls for the year ended december  the decrease in sales quantities of  bbls  or percent  was due primarily to production declines beginning in resulting from the curtailment of the venezuelan development drilling program 
venezuelan production declined to  bbls of oil per day by the end of production increased to  bbls or oil per day by the end of as a result of drilling additional wells during the year 
prices for crude oil averaged per bbl pursuant to terms of an operating service agreement from venezuela compared with per bbl for our operating expenses increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this was primarily due to increased chemical treatment  electricity and natural gas compression station maintenance and operating costs  which were partially offset by reduced salaries and material costs at the south monagas unit in venezuela 
depletion  depreciation and amortization increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with primarily due to decreased proved reserves and increased future development costs at the south monagas unit 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during was compared with during we recognized write downs of capitalized costs of million associated with exploration activities in jordan and california during the year ended december  compared with million associated with exploration activities in california  china  senegal and jordan during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the following our reduction in workforce and related restructuring costs in the write off of the joint interest receivable due from molino energy at december  associated with the california leases  and an allowance for doubtful accounts in  related to amounts owed to us by our former chief executive officer see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
taxes other than on income increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to increased venezuelan municipal taxes  which are a function of oil revenues 
investment income and other decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances 
interest expense decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the reduction of debt balances  partially offset by a reduction of capitalized interest expense 
net gain on exchange rates decreased million  or percent for the year ended december  compared with this was due to changes in the value of the bolivar 
we realized income before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december  compared with a loss of million in this resulted in increased income tax expense of million 
the effective tax rate of percent varies from the us statutory rate of percent primarily because income taxes are paid on profitable operations in foreign jurisdictions and no benefit is provided for net operating losses generated in the us the income attributable to the minority interest increased million for the year ended december  compared to this was primarily due to the increased profitability of benton vinccler 
equity in net earnings of affiliated companies increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to the increased income from geoilbent 
our share of revenues from geoilbent was million for the year ended september  compared with revenues of million for the increase of million  or percent  was due to significantly higher world crude oil prices partially offset by lower sales quantities 
prices for geoilbent s crude oil averaged per bbl during the year ended september  compared with per bbl for the year ended september  our share of geoilbent oil sales quantities decreased by  bbls  or percent  from  bbls sold during the year ended september  to  bbls sold during the year ended september  the decrease in oil sales was due primarily to the temporary interruption of production in early resulting from an accident during the period that affected certain production facilities 
we recorded extraordinary income of million during the year ended december  related to the repurchase at a discount of million of our senior unsecured notes due in we exchanged a total of million shares of our common stock with a market value of million and cash of million for million in notes 
we also wrote off million in unamortized loan fees related to the notes 
capital resources and liquidity the oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business with unique operating and financial risks see risk factors 
we require capital principally to service our debt and to fund the following costs drilling and completion costs of wells and the cost of production and transportation facilities  geological  geophysical and seismic costs  and acquisition of interests in oil and gas properties 
the amount of available capital will affect the scope of our operations and the rate of our growth 
our future rate of growth also depends substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
additionally  our ability to pay interest on our debt and general corporate overhead is dependent upon the ability of benton vinccler to make loan repayments  dividend and other cash payments to us 
debt reduction and restructuring program 
we currently have significant debt principal obligations payable in million and million 
as described below  we have reduced our obligations due in by million since september  during september  we exchanged million shares of our common stock  plus accrued interest  for million face value of the percent senior unsecured notes  and we purchased million face value of the percent senior unsecured notes for cash of million  plus accrued interest 
additionally  in november  we exchanged million shares of our common stock  plus accrued interest  for an aggregate of million face value of the percent senior unsecured notes 
we anticipate continuing to exchange our common stock or cash for such notes at a substantial discount to their face value  if available on economic terms and subject to certain limitations 
under the rules of the new york stock exchange  our common stockholders would need to approve the issuance of an aggregate of more than million shares of common stock in exchange for senior notes 
the effect of further issuances in excess of million shares of common stock in exchange for senior notes will be to materially dilute the existing stockholders if material portions of the senior notes are exchanged 
the dilutive effect on the common stockholders would depend upon a number of factors  the primary ones being the number of shares issued  the price at which the common stock is issued  and the discount on the senior notes exchanged 
working capital 
our capital resources and liquidity are affected by the timing of our semiannual interest payments of approximately million each may and november and by the quarterly payments from pdvsa at the end of the months of february  may  august and november pursuant to the terms of the contract between benton vinccler and pdvsa regarding the south monagas unit 
as a consequence of the timing of these interest payment outflows and the pdvsa payment inflows  our cash balances can increase and decrease dramatically on a few dates during the year 
in each may and november in particular  interest payments at the beginning of the month and pdvsa payments at the end of the month create large swings in our cash balances 
in october  an uncommitted short term working capital facility of billion bolivars approximately million was made available to benton vinccler by a venezuelan commercial bank 
the credit facility bears interest at fixed rates for day periods  is guaranteed by us and contains no restrictive or financial ratio covenants 
the current interest rate on the facility is percent 
we borrowed billion bolivars approximately million in october under this facility  which we repaid in november in december  we borrowed another billion bolivars approximately million at an interest rate of percent  which we repaid in january we believe that similar arrangements will be available to us in future quarters 
we will need additional funds in the future for both the development of our assets and the service of our debt  including the debt maturing in therefore  we will be required to develop sources of additional capital and or reduce or reschedule our cash requirements by various techniques including  but not limited to  the pursuit of one or more of the following alternatives restructure the existing debt  reduce the total debt outstanding by exchanging debt for equity or by repaying debt with proceeds from the sale of assets  each on appropriate terms  manage the scope and timing of our capital expenditures  substantially all of which are within our discretion  form joint ventures or alliances with financial or other industry partners  sell all or a portion of our existing assets  including interests in our assets  issue debt or equity securities or otherwise raise additional funds  or merge or combine with another entity or sell the company 
there can be no assurance that any of the above alternatives  or some combination thereof  will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
the net funds raised and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities   net increase decrease in cash    at december   we had current assets of million and current liabilities of million  resulting in working capital of million and a current ratio of this compares with our working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the decrease in working capital of million was primarily due to capital expenditures at the south monagas unit in venezuela and additional investments in and advances to arctic gas company during the year ended december  cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december  and  net cash provided by used in operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
cash flow from operating activities increased by million during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to increased collections of accrued oil revenues  increased accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the alliance agreements with schlumberger and helmerich payne and reduced general and administrative expenses  which were partially offset by increases in operating expenses  income taxes and taxes other than on income 
collections of accrued oil revenues increased million  and accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million during the year ended december  compared with cash flow from investing activities 
during the year ended december  and  we had drilling and production related capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively 
of the expenditures million was attributable to the development of the south monagas unit in venezuela  million was related to costs on the delta centro block in venezuela  million was related to the sirhan block in jordan  million was attributable to the gulf coast  and million was attributable to other projects 
in addition  during the year ended december   we increased our investment in arctic gas by million 
in august  benton vinccler sold its power generation facility located in the uracoa field of the south monagas unit in venezuela for million 
concurrent with the sale  benton vinccler entered into a long term power purchase agreement with the purchaser of the facility to provide for the electrical needs of the field throughout the remaining term of the operating service agreement 
benton vinccler used the proceeds from the sale to repay indebtedness that was collateralized by our time deposit 
permanent repayment of a portion of the loan allowed us to reduce the cash collateral for the loan thereby making such cash available for working capital needs 
as a result of the decline in oil prices  in we instituted a capital expenditure program to reduce expenditures to those that we believed were necessary to maintain current producing properties 
in the second half of  oil prices recovered substantially 
in december  we entered into incentive based development alliance agreements with schlumberger and helmerich payne as part of our plans to resume development of the south monagas unit in venezuela 
during  we drilled oil wells in the uracoa field under the alliance agreements utilizing schlumberger s technical and engineering resources 
as part of our strategic shift in focus on the value of the barrels produced  we suspended the development drilling program in venezuela for a period of approximately six months starting in january during this period  with the assistance of alliance partner schlumberger  all aspects of operations are being thoroughly reviewed to integrate field performance to date with revised computer simulation modeling and improved well completion technology 
we expect the result will be a streamlined and more effective infill drilling and well workover program that is part of an overall reservoir management strategy to drain the remaining known mmbbls mmbbls net to benton of proved reserves of oil in the fields 
our goal will be an accelerated development program with lower cost production  starting from the second half of  rising to an expected level of up to between  bbls of oil equivalent per day in less than two years 
this is based on current internal operating and financial assumptions and also assumes that we do not enter into a transaction under which we sell a significant portion of our assets  as described in item business management  operational and financial restrictions 
in the first half of  we will concentrate on improving the production from the existing available wells in venezuela 
production  currently as of march  at  bbls of oil per day in venezuela  is expected to decline to between  and  bbls of oil per day by mid year  then increase when the new development plan starts in the third quarter 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately million during the next months  including million at the south monagas unit and million at delta centro relating to the unused portion of the standby letter of credit that was paid in january to terminate the contract 
we also expect to increase our investment in arctic gas by million during the same period 
in addition  we anticipate providing or arranging loans of up to million over time to arctic gas pursuant to an equity acquisition agreement signed in april  to date  we have loaned arctic gas million under this agreement 
we continue to evaluate funding alternatives for the loans to arctic gas 
the timing and size of the investments for the south monagas unit and arctic gas are substantially at our discretion 
we anticipate that geoilbent will continue to fund its expenditures through its own cash flow and credit facilities 
our remaining capital commitments worldwide are relatively minimal and are substantially at our discretion 
we will also be required to make interest payments of approximately million related to our outstanding senior notes during the next months 
we continue to assess production levels and commodity prices in conjunction with our capital resources and liquidity requirements 
the results from the new wells drilled in the uracoa field in venezuela under the alliance agreements with schlumberger and helmerich payne indicate that the reservoir formation quality is as expected  but may be sensitive to drilling and completion practices 
additionally  a number of previously producing wells went off production during  requiring maintenance operations 
we are working with our alliance partners on techniques to optimize the production from new wells and believe that we can achieve improvements in production performance from the uracoa field 
cash flow from financing activities 
in may  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due may   of which we repurchased million at their discounted value in september and november the notes were repurchased with the issuance of million common shares and cash of million plus accrued interest 
in november  we issued million in percent senior unsecured notes due november   of which we subsequently repurchased million at their par value for cash 
interest on all of the notes is due may st and november st of each year 
the indenture agreements provide for certain limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  certain investment and capital expenditures  dividends  mergers and sales of assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the indentures 
conclusion while we can give you no assurance  we currently believe that our capital resources and liquidity will be adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures  investments in and advances to affiliates  and semiannual interest payment obligations for the next months 
our expectation is based upon our current estimate of projected price levels  production and the availability of short term working capital facilities of up to million during the time periods between the submission of quarterly invoices to pdvsa by benton vinccler and the subsequent payments of these invoices by pdvsa 
actual results could be materially affected if there is a significant decrease in either price or production levels related to the south monagas unit 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including  but not limited to  the level of production and prices  as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business 
prices for oil are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  market uncertainty and a variety of factors beyond our control 
however  our ability to retire our long term debt obligations due in the year is highly dependent upon our success in pursuing some or all of the strategic alternatives described above 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will produce enough cash for retirement of these obligations or that these obligations could be refinanced

we realized a loss before income taxes and minority interest of million during the year ended december  compared with a loss of million in  which resulted in a decrease in income tax benefit of million or percent primarily due to increased taxable income in venezuela 
the net income attributable to the minority interest increased million  or percent for compared with this was primarily due to the increased profitability of benton vinccler s operations in venezuela

our revenues decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was due to reduced oil sales revenue in venezuela as a result of declines in world crude oil prices and a percent decrease in oil sales quantities largely due to operational problems with certain high volume wells 
sales quantities for the year ended december  from venezuela were mmbbls compared with mmbbls for the year ended december  prices for crude oil averaged per bbl pursuant to terms of an operating service agreement from venezuela for the year ended december  compared with per bbl for the year ended december  our operating expenses increased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to continuing maturation of the uracoa oil field in venezuela resulting in higher water handling  natural gas handling  workover  transportation and chemical costs 
the increase was partially offset by reduced oil production in venezuela 
depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased million  or percent  during the year ended december  compared with this was primarily due to write downs of oil and natural gas properties and reduced oil sales in venezuela in  partially offset by increased capital requirements in venezuela 
depletion expense per barrel of oil produced from venezuela during the year ended december  was compared with during the previous year 
additionally  we recognized write downs of oil and gas properties during in the venezuelan cost center of million pursuant to the ceiling limitation prescribed by the full cost method of accounting 
the write downs were a result of the effect of declines in world crude oil prices on the prices realized by us for our venezuelan oil sales 
we also recognized million of impairment expense associated with certain exploration activities

domestic operations in april and may  we entered into agreements with coastline energy corporation coastline for the purpose of acquiring  exploring and developing oil and natural gas prospects both onshore and in the state waters of the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana and mississippi 
under the agreements  coastline will evaluate prospects in the gulf coast area for possible acquisition and development by us 
during the month term of the exploration agreement  we will reimburse coastline for certain of its overhead and prospect evaluation costs 
under the agreements  for prospects evaluated by coastline and that we acquire  coastline will receive compensation based on a oil and natural gas production acquired or developed and b the profits  if any  resulting from the sale of such prospects 
in april  pursuant to the agreements  we acquired an approximate percent working interest in the east lawson field in acadia parish  louisiana 
the acquisition included a percent working interest in two producing oil and natural gas wells 
during the year ended december   our share of the east lawson field production was  bbls of oil and  mcf of natural gas  resulting in income from united states oil and natural gas operations of million 
in december  we sold our interest in the east lawson field for million cash and a percent carried working interest in up to four wells that may be drilled in the future 
in march  we acquired a percent participation interest in three california state offshore oil and natural gas leases california leases from molino energy company  llc molino energy  which held percent of these leases 
the project area covers the molino  gaviota and caliente fields  located approximately miles west of santa barbara  california 
in consideration of the percent participation interest in the california leases  we became the operator of the project and agreed to pay percent of the first million and percent of the remainder of the costs of the first well drilled on the block 
during  the exploratory well was drilled to the gaviota anticline 
drill stem tests proved to be inconclusive or non commercial  and the well was temporarily abandoned for further evaluation 
in november  we entered into an agreement to acquire molino energy s interest in the california leases in exchange for the release of their joint interest billing obligations 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to focus our capital expenditures on existing producing properties and fulfilling work commitments associated with our other properties 
because we had no firm approved plans to continue drilling on the california leases and the exploratory well did not result in commercial reserves  we wrote off all of the capitalized costs associated with the california leases of million and the joint interest receivable of million due from molino energy at december  international operations on july   we and our partner  venezolana de inversiones y construcciones clerico  ca vinccler  signed an operating service agreement to reactivate and further develop three venezuelan oil fields with an affiliate of the national oil company  petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa 
the operating service agreement covers the uracoa  bombal and tucupita fields that comprise the south monagas unit the unit 
under the terms of the operating service agreement  benton vinccler  a corporation owned percent by us and percent by vinccler  is a contractor for pdvsa and is responsible for overall operations of the unit  including all necessary investments to reactivate and develop the fields comprising the unit 
the venezuelan government maintains full ownership of all hydrocarbons in the fields 
as a private contractor  benton vinccler is subject to a statutory income tax rate of percent 
however  benton vinccler reported significantly lower effective tax rates for due to the effect of the devaluation of the bolivar while benton vinccler uses the us dollar as its functional currency 
we cannot predict the timing or impact of future devaluations in venezuela 
a d seismic survey has been conducted over the southwestern portion of  and a kilometer d seismic survey has been acquired for  the delta centro block in venezuela 
during  the block s first exploration well  the jarina x  penetrated a thick potential reservoir sequence  but encountered no commercial hydrocarbons 
our total cost of acquiring seismic data and drilling the jarina x was million as december  in january  we and our bidding partners reached an agreement with corporacion venezolana del petroleo  sa to terminate the contract and our exploration obligation in exchange for the unused portion of the standby letter of credit of million 
in december  we acquired crestone energy corporation  a privately held company headquartered in denver  colorado  subsequently renamed benton offshore china company 
its principal asset is a petroleum contract with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc for the wab area 
the wab petroleum contract covers million acres in the south china sea  with an option for an additional million acres under certain circumstances  and lies within an area which is the subject of a territorial dispute between the people s republic of china and vietnam 
vietnam has executed an agreement on a portion of the same offshore acreage with conoco inc the dispute has lasted for many years  and there has been limited exploration and no development activity in the area under dispute 
china s claim of ownership of the area results from china s discovery and use and historic administration of the area 
this claim also includes third party and official foreign government recognition of china s sovereignty and jurisdiction over the contract area 
despite this claim  the territorial dispute may not be resolved in favor of china 
we cannot predict how or when  if at all  this dispute will be resolved or whether it would result in our interest being reduced 
benton offshore china company has submitted plans and budgets to cnooc for an initial seismic program to survey the area 
however  exploration activities will be subject to resolution of such territorial dispute 
at december   we had recorded no proved reserves attributable to this petroleum contract 
in august  we acquired the rights to an exploration and production sharing agreement psa with jordan s natural resources authority nra to explore  develop and produce the sirhan block in southeastern jordan 
under the terms of the psa  we were obligated to make certain capital and operating expenditures in up to three phases over eight years 
we were obligated to spend million in the first exploration phase  which was extended to may  for which we posted a million standby letter of credit  collateralized in full by a time deposit 
during the first quarter of  we reentered two wells and tested two different reservoirs 
the ws well tested significant  but non commercial amounts of natural gas  the ws well resulted in no commercial amounts of hydrocarbons 
therefore  at december   we wrote down million in capitalized costs incurred to date related to the psa 
during  we incurred an additional million in capitalized costs  which were written off at december  as of the may  expiration date of the psa  we had elected not to complete the first exploration phase of the agreement 
as a result  during the second quarter of  we recorded a liability to the nra for the obligation remaining under the psa resulting in impairment expense of million 
the nra collected on the letter of credit in august in april  we signed an agreement to earn a percent equity interest in arctic gas company  formerly severneftegaz 
arctic gas owns the exclusive rights to evaluate  develop and produce the natural gas  condensate and oil reserves in the samburg and yevo yakha license blocks in west siberia 
the two blocks comprise  acres within and adjacent to the urengoy field  russia s largest producing natural gas field 
under the terms of a cooperation agreement between us and arctic gas  we will earn a percent equity interest in exchange for providing the initial capital needed to achieve the economic self sufficiency through its own oil and natural gas production 
our capital commitment will be in the form of a credit facility of up to million for the project  the terms and timing of which have yet to be finalized 
pursuant to the cooperation agreement  we have received voting shares representing a percent ownership in arctic gas that contain restrictions on their sale and transfer 
a share disposition agreement provides for removal of the restrictions as disbursements are made under the credit facility 
due to the significant influence it exercises over the operating and financial policies of arctic gas  we account for our interest in arctic gas using the equity method 
certain provisions of russian corporate law would effectively require minority shareholder consent to enter into new agreements between us and arctic gas  or to change any terms in any existing agreements  including the conditions upon which the restrictions on the shares could be removed 
as of december   we had loaned million to arctic gas pursuant to an interim credit facility  with interest at libor plus percent  and had earned the right to remove restrictions from shares representing an approximate percent equity interest 
from december through november  we purchased shares representing an additional percent equity interest not subject to any sale or transfer restrictions 
we owned a total of percent of the outstanding voting shares of arctic gas as of december   of which approximately percent were not subject to any restrictions 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with purneftegazgeologia and purneftegaz forming geoilbent for the purpose of developing  producing and marketing crude oil from the north gubkinskoye field in the west siberia region of russia located approximately  miles northeast of moscow 
geoilbent was later re chartered as a limited liability company 
we own percent and purneftegazgeologia and purneftegaz each own percent of geoilbent 
the field covers a license block of  acres  an area approximately miles long and four miles wide 
the field has been delineated with over exploratory wells  which tested separate reservoirs 
geoilbent also holds rights to three more license blocks comprising  acres 
geoilbent commenced initial operations in the north gubkinskoye field during the third quarter of with the construction of a mile oil pipeline and installation of temporary production facilities 
russian companies are subject to a statutory income tax rate of up to percent and are subject to various other tax burdens and tariffs 
excise  pipeline and other tariffs and taxes continue to be levied on all oil producers and certain exporters  including an oil export tariff that increased to euros per ton approximately per barrel on november  from euros per ton in we are unable to predict the impact of taxes  duties and other burdens for the future for our russian operations 
effects of changing prices  foreign exchange rates and inflation our results of operations and cash flow are affected by changing oil prices 
however  our south monagas unit oil sales are based on a fee adjusted quarterly by the percentage change of a basket of crude oil prices instead of by absolute dollar changes 
this dampens both any upward and downward effects of changing prices on our venezuelan oil sales and cash flows 
if the price of oil increases  there could be an increase in our cost for drilling and related services because of increased demand  as well as an increase in oil sales 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices may affect our total planned development activities and capital expenditure program 
there are presently no restrictions in either venezuela or russia that restrict converting us dollars into local currency 
however  from june through april  venezuela implemented exchange controls which significantly limited the ability to convert local currency into us dollars 
because payments to benton vinccler are made in us dollars into its united states bank account  and benton vinccler is not subject to regulations requiring the conversion or repatriation of those dollars back into venezuela  the exchange controls did not have a material adverse effect on us or benton vinccler 
currently  there are no exchange controls in venezuela or russia that restrict conversion of local currency into us dollars for routine business operations  such as the payments of invoices  debt obligations and dividends 
within the united states  inflation has had a minimal effect on us  but it is potentially an important factor in results of operations in venezuela and russia 
with respect to benton vinccler and geoilbent  a significant majority of the sources of funds  including the proceeds from oil sales  our contributions and credit financings  are denominated in us dollars  while local transactions in russia and venezuela are conducted in local currency 
if the rate of increase in the value of the dollar compared to the bolivar continues to be less than the rate of inflation in venezuela  then inflation could be expected to have an adverse effect on benton vinccler 
during the year ended december   our net foreign exchange gains attributable to our venezuelan and russian operations were million 
however  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  many of which are beyond our control 
we have recognized significant exchange gains and losses in the past  resulting from fluctuations in the relationship of the venezuelan and russian currencies to the us dollar 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
our operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations in the areas in which we operate 
in particular  oil and natural gas production operations and economics are affected by price controls  tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  by changes in such laws and by changing administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such rules and regulations 
in addition  various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  may affect our operations and results 
cost reductions in an effort to reduce general and administrative expenses  we reduced our administrative and technical staff in carpinteria by people in october in connection with the reduction in workforce  we recorded termination benefits expenses in october of million 
all amounts were paid as of december risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating the company 
oil price declines and volatility could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil fluctuate widely 
the average price we received for oil in venezuela increased from approximately per bbl for the year ended december   to per bbl for the year ended december  during the same period  the average price we received for oil in russia increased from per bbl to per bbl 
our venezuelan oil sales are based on a fee adjusted quarterly by the percentage change of a basket of crude oil prices instead of by absolute dollar changes  which dampens both any upward and downward effects of changing prices on our venezuelan oil sales and cash flows 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to service our debt 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil that we can produce economically 
we cannot predict future oil prices 
factors that can cause this fluctuation include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in the middle east  and overall economic conditions 
we may not have available funding to execute our drilling programs 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities and the use of cash provided by operating activities 
we continue to examine the following alternative sources of long term capital sales of properties  joint venture financing  the issuance of non recourse production based financing  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  sales of prospects and technical information 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil prices and our value and performance 
we may be unable to execute our planned drilling program if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the estimates of our future reserves include the assumption that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop these reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor 
the effective interest rate at various times and our risks or the risks associated with the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the percent discount factor 
leverage materially affects our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was million 
our long term debt represented percent of our total capitalization at december  our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  the covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  the high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the indentures governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default or a change of control 
the intrinsic value of our assets is burdened by a heavy debt load and constraints on capital to optimize our producing properties in venezuela and develop our unexploited acreage in russia 
a high level of debt increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance and crude oil and natural gas realizations 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of any equity offering  or sell all or part of our assets in venezuela and russia  or some combination thereof 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
in  we recorded after tax write downs of million million pre tax 
in and  we recorded no ceiling limitation write downs 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
our future oil production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  and shortages in experienced labor or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
the prevailing price of oil also affects the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences numerous operating risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pump and pipe failures  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
our concentration of assets increases our exposure to production declines 
during  the production from the south monagas unit in venezuela represented approximately percent of our total production from consolidated companies 
our production  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected if production from the south monagas unit decreases significantly 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have substantially all of our operations in venezuela and russia 
the expenses of such operations are payable in local currency while most of the revenue from oil sales is paid in us dollars 
as a result  our operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the bolivar  ruble and us dollar 
our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
competition within the industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various foreign governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  our operations are subject to taxation policies  that in russia have changed significantly 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
foreign operations risk 
our operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  our international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange  as discussed below 
oil and natural gas prices as an independent oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and condensate 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
this volatility is demonstrated by the average realizations in venezuela  which declined from per bbl in to per bbl in and increased to per bbl in based on our budgeted production and costs  we will require an average realization in venezuela of approximately per bbl in in order to break even on income from consolidated companies before our equity in earnings from affiliated companies 
from time to time  we have utilized hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations  but we have utilized no such transactions since while hedging limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
because gains or losses associated with hedging transactions are included in oil sales when the hedged production is delivered  such gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
we did not enter into any commodity hedging agreements during or interest rates total long term debt at december   consisted of million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes maturing in million and million 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material affect on our results of operations for the year ended december  foreign exchange our operations are located primarily outside of the united states 
in particular  our current oil producing operations are located in venezuela and russia  countries which have had recent histories of significant inflation and devaluation 
for the venezuelan operations  oil sales are received under a contract in effect through in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency 
for the russian operations  a majority of the oil sales are received in us dollars  expenditures are both in us dollars and local currency  although a larger percentage of the expenditures are in local currency 
we have utilized no currency hedging programs to mitigate any risks associated with operations in these countries  and therefore our financial results are subject to favorable or unfavorable fluctuations in exchange rates and inflation in these countries
