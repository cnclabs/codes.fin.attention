through a strategic alliance with canadian national railway company cn and illinois central corporation ic together cn ic  the company has created a contiguous rail network of approximately  miles of main and branch lines connecting canada  the united states and mexico 
management believes that  as a result of the strategic position of the railway  kcsi is poised to continue to benefit from the growing north south trade between the united states  mexico and canada promoted by the implementation of nafta 
the company s rail network offers services to companies in a wide range of markets including the coal  chemicals and petroleum  paper and forest  agricultural and mineral  and intermodal and automotive markets 
page the company s principal subsidiary  kcsr  founded in  operates a rail network of approximately  miles of main and branch lines running on a north south axis from kansas city  missouri to the gulf of mexico and on an east west axis from meridian  mississippi to dallas  texas meridian speedway 
in addition to kcsr  operations include gateway western  grupo tfm  and mexrail  which wholly owns tex mex 
mexrail owns the northern half of the rail bridge at laredo which spans the rio grande river into mexico 
tfm operates the southern half of the bridge 
gateway western  a regional rail carrier  operates approximately route miles of main and branch lines running from east st 
louis  illinois to kansas city 
grupo tfm owns of tfm  which operates a railroad of approximately  miles of main and branch lines running from the us mexican border at laredo  texas to mexico city and serves three of the four major ports in mexico 
tex mex operates approximately miles of main and branch lines between laredo and the port city of corpus christi  texas 
the company also owns of the common stock of the panama canal railway company  which holds the concession to operate a mile railroad located adjacent to the panama canal 
that railroad is currently being reconstructed and is expected to resume operations in the company also owns of panarail  a joint venture organized in to provide passenger rail service over pcrc s rail lines 
kcsi s expanded rail network interconnects with all other class i railroads and provides customers with an effective alternative to other railroad routes  giving direct access to mexico and the southwestern united states through less congested interchange hubs 
eastern railroads and their customers can bypass the congested gateways at chicago  illinois  st 
louis  missouri  memphis  tennessee and new orleans  louisiana by interchanging with kcsr at meridian and jackson  mississippi and gateway western at east st 
louis 
other railroads can also interconnect with the company s rail network via other gateways at kansas city  birmingham  alabama  shreveport  louisiana  dallas  new orleans  beaumont  texas  and laredo 
the company s rail network links directly to major trading centers in northern mexico through tfm at laredo  where more than of all rail and truck traffic between the two countries crosses the border 
kcsi s rail network is further expanded through marketing agreements with norfolk southern and i m rail link 
marketing agreements with norfolk southern allow the company to gain incremental traffic between the southeast and the southwest on the meridian speedway 
a marketing agreement with i m rail link provides access to minneapolis and chicago and to corn and other grain origination s in iowa  minnesota and illinois 
rail network owned network kcsr owns and operates approximately  miles of main and branch lines and  miles of other tracks in a nine state region that includes missouri  kansas  arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana and texas 
kcsr has the shortest north south rail route between kansas city and several key ports along the gulf of mexico in louisiana  mississippi and texas and an east west rail route between meridian and dallas 
this geographic reach enables service to a customer base that includes electric generating utilities and a wide range of companies in the chemical and petroleum  agricultural and mineral  paper and forest  and automotive and intermodal markets 
gateway western owns and operates approximately miles of main and branch lines linking kansas city with east st 
louis and springfield  illinois 
in addition  gateway western has limited haulage rights between springfield and chicago that allow gateway western to move traffic that originates or terminates on its rail lines 
gateway western provides access to east st 
louis  and page allows rail traffic to avoid the more congested and costly st 
louis terminal 
like kcsr  gateway western serves customers in a wide range of industries 
kcsr and gateway western revenues and net income are dependent on providing reliable service to customers at competitive rates  the general economic conditions in the geographic region served and the ability to effectively compete against alternative modes of surface transportation  such as over the road truck transportation 
the ability of kcsr and gateway western to construct and maintain the roadway in order to provide safe and efficient transportation service is important to the ongoing viability as a rail carrier 
additionally  cost containment is important in maintaining a competitive market position  particularly with respect to employee costs as approximately of kcsr and gateway western combined employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
significant investments mexrail in the company invested approximately million to acquire a economic interest in mexrail  which owns of tex mex and certain other assets 
tex mex and tfm operate the international rail traffic bridge at laredo spanning the rio grande river 
transportacion maritima mexicana  sa de sa tmm  the largest shareholder of grupo tfm  owns the remaining of mexrail 
the bridge at laredo is the most significant entry point for rail traffic between mexico and the united states 
tex mex also operates a mile rail line extending from laredo to corpus christi 
tex mex connects to kcsr through trackage rights between corpus christi and beaumont 
these trackage rights were granted pursuant to a surface transportation board stb decision and have an initial term of years 
tex mex provides a vital link between the company s us operations through kcsr and its mexican operations through tfm 
on march   tex mex purchased from the union pacific railroad company up a line of railroad extending miles between rosenberg  texas and victoria  texas  and granted tex mex trackage sufficient to integrate the line into the existing trackage rights 
the purchase price for the line of million was determined through arbitration and the acquisition also required the prior approval or exemption of the transaction by the stb 
by its order entered on december   the stb granted tex mex s petition for exemption and exempted the transaction from this prior approval requirement 
once reconstruction of the line is completed  tex mex will be able to shorten its existing route between corpus christi and houston by over miles 
grupo tfm in the company invested million to obtain a interest in grupo tfm 
tmm and a tmm affiliate own of grupo tfm and the mexican government owns of grupo tfm 
grupo tfm owns of the common stock of tfm 
the remaining of tfm was retained by the mexican government 
tfm is both a strategic and financial investment for kcsi 
strategically the investment in tfm promotes the company s nafta growth strategy whereby the company and its strategic partners can provide transportation services between the heart of mexico s industrial base  the us and canada 
tfm seeks to establish its railroad as the primary inland freight transporter linking mexico with the us and canadian markets along the nafta corridor 
tfm s strategy is to provide reliable customer service  capitalize on foreign trade growth and convert truck tonnage to rail 
under the concession awarded to grupo tfm by the mexican government in  tfm operates the northeast rail lines  which are located along a strategically significant corridor between mexico and the us  and have as their core routes a key portion of the shortest  most direct rail passageway between mexico city and the southern  midwestern and eastern united states 
these page rail lines are the only rail lines which serve nuevo laredo  the largest rail freight exchange point between the united states and mexico 
tfm s rail lines connect the most populated and industrialized regions of mexico with mexico s principal us border railway gateway at laredo 
in addition  this rail system serves three of mexico s four primary seaports at veracruz and tampico on the gulf of mexico and lazaro cardenas on the pacific ocean 
tfm serves mexican states and mexico city  which together represent a majority of the country s population and account for a majority of its estimated gross domestic product 
this route structure enables the company to benefit from growing trade resulting from the increasing integration of the north american economy through nafta 
trade between mexico and the united states has grown significantly from through through tex mex and kcsr  as well as through interchanges with other major us railroads  tfm provides its customers with access to an extensive network through which they may distribute their products throughout north america and overseas 
tfm operates  miles of main and branch lines and an additional miles of sidings  spur tracks and main line under trackage rights 
tfm has the right to operate the rail lines  but does not own the land  roadway or associated structures 
approximately of the main line operated by tfm consists of continuously welded rail 
as of december   tfm owned locomotives  owned or leased from affiliates  freight cars and leased from non affiliates locomotives and  freight cars 
financially  kcsi management believes tfm has growth potential 
tfm s operating strategy has been to increase productivity and maximize operating efficiencies 
with mexico s economic progress  growth of nafta trade between mexico  the united states and canada  and customer focused rail service  the company believes that the growth potential of tfm could be significant 
panama canal railway company the panama canal railway is a north south railroad traversing the panama isthmus between the pacific and atlantic oceans 
its origins date back to the late s and the railway serves as a complement to the panama canal shipping channel 
the railroad is currently under reconstruction and is expected to be complete by mid with commercial operations to begin immediately thereafter 
management believes the prime potential and opportunity of pcrc will be in the movement of traffic between the ports of balboa and colon for shipping customers repositioning containers 
pcrc has had significant interest from both shipping companies and port terminal operators 
in addition  there has been interest in passenger traffic for both commuter and pleasure tourist travel see below 
while only miles long  the company believes pcrc provides the company with a unique opportunity to participate in transoceanic shipments as a complement to the existing canal traffic 
in january  the republic of panama awarded the pcrc  a joint venture between kcsr and mi jack products  inc mi jack  the concession to reconstruct and operate the panama canal railway 
as of december   the company has invested approximately million toward the reconstruction of the existing mile railway which runs parallel to the panama canal and  upon reconstruction  will provide international shippers with a railway transportation medium to complement the panama canal 
in november  the pcrc completed the financing arrangements for this project with the international finance corporation ifc  a member of the world bank group 
panarail tourism company during  the company and mi jack formed a joint venture designed to operate and promote commuter and pleasure tourist passenger service over the pcrc 
panarail is expected to commence operations in  immediately following completion of the reconstruction of pcrc s tracks 
expanded network through a strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern and the i m rail link  the company has expanded the domestic geographic reach beyond that covered by its owned network 
strategic alliance with canadian national and illinois central 
in kcsr  cn and ic announced a year strategic alliance aimed at coordinating the marketing  operations and investment elements of north south rail freight transportation 
the strategic alliance did not require stb approval and was effective immediately 
this alliance connects canadian markets  the major midwest us markets of detroit  chicago  kansas city and st 
louis and the key southern markets of memphis  dallas and houston 
it also provides us and canadian shippers with access to mexico s rail system through our connections with tex mex and tfm 
in addition to providing access to key north south international and domestic us traffic corridors  the alliance with cn ic is intended to increase business primarily in the automotive and intermodal markets and also in the chemical and petroleum and paper and forest products markets 
this alliance has provided opportunities for revenue growth and positioned the company as a key provider of rail service for nafta trade 
under a separate agreement  kcsr and cn formed a management group made up of representatives from both railroads to develop plans for the construction of new facilities to support business development  including investments in automotive  intermodal and transload facilities at memphis  dallas  kansas city and chicago 
this agreement also granted kcsr certain trackage and haulage rights and granted cn and ic certain haulage rights 
under the terms of this agreement  and through action taken by the stb  in october kcsr gained access to six additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial area through haulage rights 
marketing agreements with norfolk southern 
in december kcsr entered into a three year marketing agreement with norfolk southern and tex mex which provides for additional traffic volume along the east west corridor between meridian and dallas by using interchange points with norfolk southern 
this agreement provides norfolk southern run through service with access to dallas and the mexican border at laredo while avoiding the congested rail gateways of memphis and new orleans 
this agreement will be automatically renewed for additional three year terms unless written notice of termination is given at least days prior to the expiration of the then current term 
this agreement was automatically renewed for an additional term of three years in december in may  kcsr entered into an agreement with norfolk southern under which kcsr will provide haulage services for intermodal traffic between meridian and dallas in exchange for fees from norfolk southern 
under this agreement norfolk southern may quote rates and enter into transportation service contracts with shippers and receivers covering this haulage traffic 
unless renewed by norfolk southern  this agreement terminates on december  page this new marketing agreement with norfolk southern provides kcsr with additional sources of intermodal business 
the current arrangement envisions approximately two trains per day running between the company s connection with norfolk southern at meridian and the burlington northern santa fe corporation bnsf connection at dallas 
the structure of the agreement provides for lower gross revenue to kcsr  but improved operating income since fuel and car hire expenses are the responsibility of norfolk southern under the agreement 
management believes this business has additional growth potential as norfolk southern seeks to shift its traffic to southern gateways to increase its length of haul 
marketing agreement with i m rail link 
in may  kcsr entered into a marketing agreement with i m rail link which provides kcsr with access to minneapolis  minnesota and chicago and to origination s of corn and other grain in iowa  minnesota and illinois 
through this marketing agreement  kcsr receives and originates shipments of grain products for delivery to poultry industry feed mills on its network 
grain is currently kcsr s largest export product to mexico 
this agreement is terminable upon days notice 
haulage rights 
as a result of the acquisition of the missouri kansas texas railroad by up  kcsr was granted haulage rights between council bluffs  iowa  omaha and lincoln  nebraska and atchison and topeka  kansas on the one hand and kansas city  missouri on the other hand  and a joint rate agreement for our grain traffic between beaumont  texas on the one hand and houston and galveston  texas on the other hand 
kcsr has the right to convert these haulage rights to trackage rights 
kcsr s haulage rights require up to move kcsr traffic in up trains  trackage rights would allow kcsr to operate its trains over up tracks 
these rights have a term of years 
markets served the following table summarizes combined kcsr gateway western revenue and carload statistics by commodity category 
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect changes in the business groups and to conform to the current year presentation 
carloads and revenues intermodal units in millions in thousands kcsr gateway western general commodities chemical and petroleum paper and forest agricultural and mineral total general commodities intermodal and automotive coal carload revenues and carload and intermodal units other rail related revenues total kcsr gateway western revenues page chemicals and petroleum chemical and petroleum products accounted for approximately of kcsr gateway western combined total revenues in kcsr gateway western transport chemical and petroleum products via tank and hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast united states through interchange with other rail carriers 
management expects certain product revenues within this commodity group to improve in the future as a result of access  which began on october  under the agreement with cn  to additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial corridor one of the largest concentrations of chemical suppliers in the world 
paper and forest paper and forest products accounted for approximately of kcsr gateway western combined total revenues in the company s rail lines run through the heart of the southeastern us timber producing region 
management believes that trees from this region tend to grow faster and that forest products made from them are generally less expensive than those from other regions 
as a result  southern yellow pine products from the southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western producers who have experienced capacity reductions because of public policy considerations 
kcsr gateway western serve eleven paper mills directly and six others indirectly through short line connections 
customers include international paper company  georgia pacific corporation and riverwood international 
primary traffic includes pulp and paper  lumber  panel products plywood and oriented strand board  engineered wood products  pulpwood  woodchips  raw fiber used in the production of paper  pulp and paperboard  as well as metal  scrap and slab steel  waste and military equipment 
slab steel products are used primarily in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry  and military equipment is shipped to and from several military bases on the company s rail lines agricultural and mineral agricultural and mineral products accounted for approximately of kcsr gateway western combined total revenues in agricultural products consist of domestic and export grain  food and related products 
shipper demand for agricultural products is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain products as well as price fluctuations in international markets for key commodities 
in the domestic grain business  the company s rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills serving the poultry industry 
through the marketing agreement with i m rail link  the company s rail lines have access to sources of corn and other grain in iowa and other midwestern states 
kcsr currently serves feed mills along its rail lines throughout arkansas  oklahoma  texas  louisiana  mississippi and alabama 
export grain shipments include primarily wheat  soybean and corn transported to the gulf of mexico for international destinations and to mexico via laredo 
over the long term  grain shipments are expected to increase as a result of the company s strategic investments in tex mex and tfm  given mexico s reliance on grain imports 
food and related products consist mainly of soybean meal  grain meal  oils and canned goods  sugar and beer 
mineral shipments consist of a variety of products including ores  clay  stone and cement 
intermodal and automotive intermodal products accounted for approximately of kcsr gateway western combined total revenues in the intermodal freight business consists of hauling freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water  rail and motor carriers  with rail carriers serving as the link between the other modes of transportation 
the company s intermodal business has grown significantly over the last seven years with intermodal units increasing from  in to  in and intermodal revenues increasing from million to nearly million during the same period 
through our dedicated intermodal train service between meridian and dallas  the company competes directly with truck carriers along the interstate corridor 
page the intermodal business is highly price and service driven as the trucking industry maintains certain competitive advantages over the rail industry 
trucks are not obligated to provide or maintain rights of way and do not have to pay real estate taxes on their routes 
in prior years  the trucking industry diverted a substantial amount of freight from railroads as truck operators efficiency over long distances increased 
in response to these competitive pressures  railroad industry management sought avenues to improve the competitiveness of rail traffic and forged numerous alliances with truck companies in order to move more traffic by rail and provide faster  safer and more efficient service to their customers 
kcsr has entered into agreements with several trucking companies for train service in several corridors  but those services are concentrated between dallas and meridian 
as kcsr gateway western s intermodal revenues increased  margins on certain intermodal business declined 
in management addressed the declining margins by increasing certain intermodal rates effective september  and by closing two underperforming intermodal facilities at salisaw  oklahoma and port arthur  texas on the north south route 
these actions have helped to improve the profitability and operating efficiency of the company s intermodal business 
the strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern provide the company the potential to further capitalize on the growth potential of intermodal freight revenues  particularly for traffic moving between points in the upper midwest and canada to kansas city  dallas and mexico 
furthermore  the company is in the process of transforming the former richards gebaur airbase in kansas city to a us customs pre clearance processing facility  the kansas city international freight gateway ifg  which is expected to handle and process large volumes of domestic and international intermodal freight 
upon completion  management expects this facility to provide additional opportunities for intermodal revenue growth 
through an agreement with mazda through the ford motor company claycomo manufacturing facility located in kansas city  kcsr has developed an automotive distribution facility at the richards gebaur facility 
this facility became operational in april for the movement of mazda vehicles 
full intermodal and automotive operations at the facility are expected to be in service in  providing kcsr with additional capacity in kansas city 
the company s automotive traffic consists primarily of vehicle parts moving into mexico from the northern sections of the united states and finished vehicles moving from mexico into the united states 
cn ic  norfolk southern and tfm have a significant number of automotive production facilities on their rail lines 
the company s rail network essentially serves as the connecting bridge carrier for these movements of automotive parts and finished vehicles 
the company has also recently transacted with ford to ship automotive parts from east st 
louis to kansas city 
coal coal historically has been one of the most stable sources of revenues and is the largest single commodity handled by kcsr 
in  coal revenues represented of kcsr gateway western combined total revenues 
substantially all coal customers are under long term contracts  which typically have an average contract term of approximately five years 
kcsr s most significant customer is swepco  which is under contract until the company delivers coal to nine electric generating plants  including swepco facilities in flint creek  arkansas and welsh  texas  kansas city power and light plants in kansas city and amsterdam  missouri  an empire district electric company plant near pittsburg  kansas and an entergy gulf states plant in mossville  louisiana 
swepco and entergy gulf states together comprised approximately of kcsr gateway western s total coal revenues in the coal kcsr transports originates in the powder river basin in wyoming and is transferred to kcsr s rail lines at kansas city 
kcsr also transports coal as an intermediate carrier for a western farmers electric cooperative plant from page kansas city to dequeen  arkansas  where it interchanges with a short line carrier for delivery to the plant  and delivers lignite to an electric generating plant at monticello  texas 
in the fourth quarter of  kcsr began serving as a bridge carrier for coal deliveries to a texas utilities electric generating plant in martin lake  texas 
other other rail related revenues include a variety of miscellaneous services provided to customers and interconnecting carriers and accounted for approximately of total combined kcsr gateway western revenues in major items in this category include railcar switching services  demurrage car retention penalties and drayage local truck transportation services 
also included in this category are haulage services performed for the benefit of bnsf under an agreement  which continues through and includes minimum volume commitments 
railroad industry trends and competition the company s rail operations compete against other railroads  many of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
since  there has been significant consolidation among major north american rail carriers  including the merger of burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation bn sf  collectively bnsf  the merger of the up and the chicago and north western transportation company up cnw and the merger of up with southern pacific corporation sp 
further norfolk southern and csx purchased the assets of conrail in and the cn acquired the ic in june as a result of this consolidation  the railroad industry is now dominated by a few mega carriers 
kcsi management believes that revenues were negatively affected by the up cnw  up sp and bn sf mergers  which led to diversions of rail traffic away from kcsr s rail lines 
the company also believes that kcsr revenues have been negatively impacted by the congestion resulting from the purchase of conrail s assets by norfolk southern and csx in management regards the larger western railroads  in particular  as significant competitors to the company s operations and prospects because of their substantial resources 
management believes  however  that because of the company s investments and strategic alliances  it is positioned to attract additional rail traffic through our nafta railway 
in late  a merger was announced between bnsf and cn 
subsequent to this announcement  the stb imposed a month moratorium on class railroad merger activities  while it reviews and rewrites the rules applicable to railroad consolidation 
in july  the stb s moratorium was upheld by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the moratorium  and more directly the new rules  will likely have a substantial effect on future railroad merger activity 
subsequent to the court s decision  bnsf and cn announced the termination of their proposed merger 
truck carriers have eroded the railroad industry s share of total transportation revenues 
changing regulations  subsidized highway improvement programs and favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive position of trucks in the united states as an alternative mode of surface transportation for many commodities 
in the united states  the truck industry generally is more cost and transit time competitive than railroads for distances of less than miles 
intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition  particularly from motor carriers 
however  rail carriers  including kcsr  have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working together with motor carriers and other railroads to provide end to end transportation of products  especially where the length of haul exceeds miles 
the company is also subject to competition from barge lines and other maritime shipping  which compete with the company across certain routes in its operating area 
mississippi and missouri river barge traffic  among others  compete with kcsr and its rail connections in the transportation of bulk commodities such as grains  steel and petroleum products 
page increased competition has resulted in downward pressure on freight rates 
competition with other railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates charged  the quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality of the carrier s equipment for certain commodities 
employees and labor relations approximately of kcsr gateway western employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
in  national labor contracts governing the kcsr were negotiated with all major railroad unions  including the united transportation union  the brotherhood of locomotive engineers  the transportation communications international union  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees  and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
formal negotiations to enter into new agreements are in progress and the labor contracts will remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
the wage increase elements of these new agreements may have retroactive application 
the provisions of the various labor agreements generally include periodic general wage increases  lump sum payments to workers and greater work rule flexibility  among other provisions 
the company is currently exploring alternative compensation arrangements in lieu of cash increases 
management does not expect that the negotiations or the resulting labor agreements will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
labor agreements related to former midsouth employees covered by collective bargaining agreements reopened for negotiations in these agreements entail eighteen separate groups of employees and are not included in the national labor contracts 
kcsr management has reached new agreements with all but one of these unions 
while discussions with this one union are ongoing  the company does not anticipate that this process or the resulting labor agreement will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
most gateway western employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that extended through december negotiations on those agreements began in late  and those agreements will remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
the company does not anticipate that this process or the resulting labor agreements will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
kcsr  gateway and other railroads continue to be affected by labor regulations  which typically are more burdensome than those governing non rail industries  such as trucking competitors 
the railroad retirement act requires up to a contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages  while the social security and medicare acts only require a employer contribution on similar wage bases 
other programs  such as the federal employers liability act fela  when compared to worker s compensation laws  illustrate the competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by federal labor regulations 
joint venture arrangements mexrail the share purchase agreement dated as of october  between kcsi and tmm which governs the investment in mexrail provides  among other things  that the company has a right of first refusal if tmm decides to sell all or a portion of its mexrail common stock  tmm votes its mexrail common stock in favor of a merger or consolidation involving mexrail or tex mex or any plan to sell all or substantially all of the assets of mexrail or tex mex or mexrail decides to sell all page or a portion of its tex mex common stock 
the share purchase agreement also gives the company the right to appoint two of mexrail s five directors and four of tex mex s nine directors 
grupo tfm in december  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with tmm 
the purposes of the joint venture were  among others  to provide for the formation of grupo tfm  to provide for participation in the upcoming privatization of the mexican national railway system through grupo tfm  and to promote the movement of rail traffic over tex mex  tfm and kcsr 
the term of the joint venture agreement was automatically renewed for a term of three years on december  and will automatically renew for additional terms of three years each unless either tmm or the company gives notice of termination at least days prior to the end of the then current term 
the joint venture agreement may also terminate under certain circumstances prior to the end of a term  including upon a change of control or bankruptcy of either tmm or the company or a material default by tmm or the company 
upon termination of the agreement  any joint venture assets that are not held in kcsi s or tmm s name will be distributed proportionally to tmm and kcsi 
the joint venture does not have any material assets and management believes that a termination of the joint venture agreement would not have a material adverse effect on the company or its interests in mexrail or grupo tfm 
the grupo tfm by laws and the shareholders agreement dated may  between kcsi  caymex transportation  inc  grupo servia  sa de sa grupo servia  tmm and tmm multimodal  sa de sa  which governs our investment in grupo tfm restrict each of the parties to the shareholders agreement from directly or indirectly transferring any interest in grupo tfm or tfm to a competitor of the parties  grupo tfm or tfm without the prior written consent of each of the parties  prohibit any transfer of shares of grupo tfm to any person other than an affiliate without the prior consent of grupo tfm s board of directors and provide that kcsi  grupo servia and tmm may not transfer control of any subsidiary holding all or any portion of shares of grupo tfm to a third party other than an affiliate or another party to the shareholders agreement without the consent of the other parties to the shareholders agreement 
the grupo tfm by laws grant the shareholders of grupo tfm a right of first refusal to acquire shares to be transferred by any other shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by each non transferring shareholder  although holders of preferred shares or shares with special or limited rights are only entitled to acquire those shares and not ordinary shares 
the shareholders agreement requires that the boards of directors of grupo tfm and tfm be constituted to reflect the parties relative ownership of the ordinary voting common stock of grupo tfm 
tfm holds the concession to operate mexico s northeast rail lines for the years beginning in june and  subject to certain conditions  has an option to extend the concession for an additional years 
the concession is subject to certain mandatory trackage rights and is only exclusive for years 
additionally  the mexican government may revoke exclusivity after years if it determines that there is insufficient competition and may terminate the concession as a result of certain conditions or events  including tfm s failure to meet its operating and financial obligations with regard to the concession under applicable mexican law  a statutory appropriation by the mexican government for reasons of public interest and liquidation or bankruptcy of tfm 
tfm s assets and its rights under the concession may also be seized temporarily by the mexican government 
in  grupo tfm paid approximately billion to the mexican government as the purchase price for of tfm 
grupo tfm funded a significant portion of the purchase with capital contributions from tmm and kcsi 
additionally  a portion of the purchase was funded through senior secured term credit facilities million  senior notes and senior discount debentures million  and proceeds from the sale of of grupo tfm to the mexican government approximately million based on the then effective us dollar mexican peso page exchange rate 
additionally  grupo tfm entered into a million revolving credit facility for general working capital purposes 
the mexican government s interest in grupo tfm is in the form of limited voting right shares 
kcsi  tmm and an affiliate of tmm  grupo servia  have a call option for the mexican government s interest in grupo tfm which is exercisable  prior to july   at the original amount in us dollars paid by the mexican government plus interest based on one year us treasury securities 
in addition  after the expiration of that call option  kcsi  tmm and grupo servia have a right of first refusal to purchase the mexican government s interest in grupo tfm if the mexican government wishes to sell that interest to a third party which is not a governmental entity 
on or after october  the mexican government has the option to sell its interest in tfm through a public offering or to grupo tfm at the initial share price paid by grupo tfm plus interest 
in the event that grupo tfm does not purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm  the government may require tmm and kcsi  or either tmm or kcsi  to purchase its interest 
kcsi and tmm have cross indemnities in the event the mexican government requires only one of them to purchase its interest 
the cross indemnities allow the party required to purchase the mexican government s interest to require the other party to purchase its pro rata portion of such interest 
however  if kcsi were required to purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm and tmm could not meet its obligations under the cross indemnity  then kcsi would be obligated to pay the total purchase price for the mexican government s interest 
tmm and kcsi are currently in negotiations with the mexican government that may lead to a purchase of the mexican government s interest in tfm at a discount from the current option price 
during the third quarter of  grupo tfm accomplished a refinancing of approximately million of its senior secured credit facility through the issuance of a us commercial paper program backed by a letter of credit 
this refinancing provides the ability for grupo tfm to pay limited dividends with the consent of kcsi and tmm  however  none have been paid 
panama canal railway company the financing for the panama canal railway company is comprised of a million investment from the ifc and senior loans through the ifc in an aggregate amount of up to million
