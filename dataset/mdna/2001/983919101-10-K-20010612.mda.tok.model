you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those risks discussed under factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this document 
forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking words  such as may  will  could  should  expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  continue  plan  intend  project  or other similar words 
nature of operations xilinx  inc xilinx or the company designs  develops and markets complete programmable logic solutions  including advanced integrated circuits ics  software design tools  predefined system functions delivered as cores of logic  design services  customer training  and field engineering support 
our programmable logic ics include field programmable gate arrays fpgas and complex programmable logic devices cplds 
these components are standard ics programmed by our customers to perform desired logic operations 
our products are designed to provide high integration and quick time to market for electronic equipment manufacturers primarily in communications  storage  servers  instrumentation  industrial  and other markets 
we market our products throughout the world through a direct sales organization  direct sales to original equipment manufacturers by independent sales representative firms  sales through franchised domestic and foreign distributors 
results of operations net revenue in thousands change change net revenues    xilinx s net revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the significant growth in spartan and virtex product lines 
net revenue growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to decelerating bookings and order cancellations resulting from a softening economy and increased inventory levels experienced by a broad base of customers 
increase in fiscal over was primarily due to the significant growth in xcxl  xcxla  xc  spartan tm  and virtex product lines  which was partially offset by decreased revenues in our mature xc family 
we classify our product offerings into four categories by semiconductor manufacturing process technology 
these four product categories are adjusted on a regular basis to accommodate advances in our process technology 
advanced products include our newest technologies manufactured on micron and smaller processes  which include the xcxv  xcxla  spartan xl tm  spartan ii tm  virtex tm  virtex e tm and virtex ii product lines 
advanced products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and the significant increases in revenues of advanced products were due to the introduction and strong market acceptance of virtex e and spartan ii products 
mainstream products are currently manufactured on and micron technologies and include the xce  xcex  xcxl  xc  xc  xcxl  spartan tm and coolrunner product lines 
mainstream products represented of total revenues in fiscal and in fiscal mainstream products saw the heaviest revenue decline in the xl and product families due to the combination of the softening economy  excess inventory in the channel  and customer s migration to newer production offerings 
base products consist of our mature product families that are currently manufactured on technologies of micron and older  this includes the xc  xc  xc  and xc families 
base products represented of total revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal our support products make up the remainder of our product offerings and include configuration solutions  serial proms  hardwire  software and support 
support products represented and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
no end customer accounted for more than of revenues in fiscal  or the revenue by technology for the years ended march   and was as follows in millions advanced products mainstream products base products support products total revenue   in order to compete effectively  we pass manufacturing cost reductions to our customers in the form of reduced prices to the extent that we can maintain acceptable returns 
price erosion has been common in the semiconductor industry  as advances in both product architecture and manufacturing process technology have permitted continual reductions in unit cost 
we have historically been able to offset much of the revenue declines of our mature technologies with increased revenues from newer technologies  although no assurance can be given that we can continue to do so in the future 
the revenue by geography for the years ended march    and was as follows in millions north america  europe japan asia pacific rest of world total revenue   international revenues represented approximately   and of total revenues for fiscal years   and  respectively 
europe  japan  and asia pacific rest of world experienced revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to wider adoption of our new products in consumer and telecommunication applications 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our accounting method for recognizing revenue on all shipments to international distributors 
the change was made retroactive to the beginning of fiscal while we previously deferred revenue on shipments to domestic distributors until the products were sold to the end user  we recognized revenue upon shipment to international distributors  net of appropriate reserves for returns and allowances 
following the accounting change  revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the end customer 
we believe that deferral of revenue on shipments to distributors until the product is shipped by the distributor to an end customer is a more meaningful measurement of results of operations  and is consistent with industry practice 
accordingly  it is a preferable method of accounting for revenue 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method for prior years was a charge of million  net of million in taxes  or net income per diluted share 
gross margin in thousands change change gross margin    percentage of net revenues during fiscal  our gross margin percentage decreased from the prior year primarily due to the write down for inventory in excess of the demand and backlog due to a slow down in business during the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the gross margin percentage decreased from the prior year due to lower margin new products such as spartan ii and virtex e and the decline in revenue of our older more profitable product families 
during fiscal  our gross margin percentage increased slightly from the prior year as efficiencies from increased production volumes resulted in decreased costs as a percentage of revenue 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    percentage of net revenues research and development expenditures were million million excluding rocketchips deferred stock compensation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
we increased our expenditures in research and development as we have done each year during our seventeen year history 
the increase in research and development expenditures from fiscal to was related to designing new complex and high density devices  mask and wafer purchases  development of advanced process technologies  software development  increased labor related costs associated with the development of new products along with increased labor costs associated with the acquisition of rocketchips 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in research and development expenditures from fiscal to was related to designing new complex and high density devices  wafer purchases  development of advanced process technologies using micron and micron technologies  software development  increased labor related costs  along with increased costs associated with the acquisition of the coolrunner cpld business 
we remain committed to a significant level of research and development effort in order to extend our technology leadership in the programmable logic marketplace 
through march   we have received over issued us patents and we maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of circuit design and software 
sales  general and administrative in thousands change change sales  general and administrative    percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues in the fiscal and million  or of net revenues in the fiscal although total selling  general and administrative spending increased  they decreased as a percentage of net revenues because of strong revenue growth and operational efficiencies 
the increase in sales  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased advertising and promotional expenditures  increased outside sales commissions and sales incentives on higher revenues and legal expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal over due to increased personnel and facilities expenses  increased marketing expenses and higher commission and incentive expenses associated with increased sales 
we remain committed to controlling administrative expenses 
however  the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing enforcement of our intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and may increase in the future 
write off of in process technology in connection with the acquisition of rocketchips in fiscal  approximately million of in process research and development costs were incurred 
in fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of philips semiconductors line of low power complex programmable logic devices cplds  approximately million was incurred for the research and development project in process and in fiscal in the acquisition of mi acquisition llp  approximately million was related to research and development in process 
the projects identified as in process will require additional effort in order to establish technological feasibility 
these projects have identifiable technological risk factors that indicate that even though successful completion is expected  it is not assured 
if an identified project is not successfully completed there is no alternative future use for the project and the expected future income will not be realized 
the acquired in process technology represents the appraised value of technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses 
to determine the value of the in process research and development  the expected future cash flow attributable to the in process technology was discounted  taking into account the percentage of completion  utilization of preexisting core technology  risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology  existing and future markets  and technological risk associated with completing the development of the technology 
we immediately expense this non recurring charge in the period of acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital gain from merger of usic with umc in january united silicon inc usic was merged into united microelectronics corp umc and our equity position in usic was converted into shares of umc which are publicly traded on the taiwan stock exchange 
we recognized a non cash gain of million million net of taxes in fiscal as a result of the merger of usic with umc 
the gain represents the appreciation of our investment in usic 
as a result of this merger  we received approximately million umc shares  which represent approximately of the combined umc group 
in july  we received a stock dividend which increased our investment holdings in umc to approximately million shares 
we retain equivalent wafer capacity rights in umc as we previously had in usic  as long as we retain a defined percentage of our shares of umc common stock 
if our holdings fall below that percentage  our wafer capacity rights would be prorated by the umc shares we hold 
due to restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange  the majority of our umc shares could not be sold until july these regulatory restrictions will gradually expire between july and january write down on umc investment valuation due to the current weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our umc shares declined to million as of march  the downturn in the semiconductor industry and the economy in general  appears to be more severe than previously anticipated  and there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding when the semiconductor industry will recover from this down cycle 
because of the continued downturn in the economy  we believe that the decline in the market value of our investment in umc as of march   was other than temporary as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized a pre tax loss of million 
if the value our umc shares declines further  we may be required to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss if we sell our umc shares due to fluctuations in the market value of umc stock 
interest and other income  net in thousands change change interest income and other income  net    percentage of net revenues interest and other income was million  or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million  or of net revenues in fiscal and million  or of net revenues in fiscal for fiscal  interest and other income included a pre tax gain on our investment in nuron llc of million due to nuron being purchased by a public company 
excluding the nuron llc gain  net interest and other income was million  or of sales 
excluding the nuron llc gain  the dollar increase from fiscal year to was primarily due to an increase in the interest income related to higher investment balances and higher interest rates offset by foreign exchange losses due to the weaker japanese yen in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in interest and other income in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the million decrease in interest expense related to the redemption in february of our previously outstanding convertible notes in february and increased interest income on higher average cash and investment balances 
the amount of net interest and other income in the future will continue to be impacted by the level of our average cash and investment balances  prevailing interest rates  the balance of any debt outstanding  and foreign currency exchange rates 
provision for income taxes in thousands change change provision for taxes on income    effective tax rate the effective tax rate in fiscal is higher than fiscal principally due to in process research and development charges with no corresponding tax benefit to the company 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was higher than fiscal principally due to taxes of million on a million gain realized on the umc usic merger  which significantly offset tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest and foreign earnings at lower tax rates which generally reduce our effective tax rate 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   the internal revenue service issued a statutory notice of deficiency reflecting proposed audit adjustments for fiscal years   and we filed a petition with the tax court on march  contesting this notice of deficiency 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the proposed adjustments and sufficient taxes have been provided 
joint venture equity converted to umc shares we recorded our proportional ownership of the net income loss of usic  a wafer fabrication joint venture located in taiwan  as joint venture equity income loss prior to the merger of usic and umc 
in fiscal  income was generated as usic began to realize volume wafer production and shipments 
the fiscal net loss was a result of the continued ramp up in production of the wafer fabrication facility 
as a result of the conversion of our equity position in usic to shares of umc in january  as discussed above  we no longer record joint venture equity income 
inflation to date  the effects of inflation upon our financial results have not been significant 
we cannot assure  however  inflation will not affect us materially in the future 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have used a combination of equity and debt financing and cash flow from operations to support on going business activities  acquiring critical technologies  and making investments in complementary technologies  purchase facilities and capital equipment  and finance inventory and accounts receivable 
additionally  our investment in umc is available for future sale  subject to restrictions 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal  we generated cash flow of million from operating activities  million from investing activities  and consumed million from financing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included million in net proceeds from sales and purchases of investments  million cash obtained from acquisition of rocketchips  inc  offset by million expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
financing activities during fiscal year included an increase of million from issuance of common stocks and sales of put warrants  offset by million of stock buyback 
during fiscal  we generated cash flow of million from operating activities and million from financing activities  offset by million of cash used for investing activities 
investing activities during fiscal included million in net purchases of investments  million expenditures for property  plant and equipment  and million for the purchase of philips cpld business 
financing activities during included million in proceeds from sales of common stock under employee option and stock purchase plans and million from sales of put warrants partially offset by million of stock buyback 
receivables receivables increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increased level of sales 
inventories inventories increased from million at march to million at march due to the increased level of sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down inventory due to a decrease in forecasted demand 
given the volatility of the market and the obsolescence in technology and shorter product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog and forecasted demand 
however  backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such difference may have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations 
we attempt to maintain sufficient levels of inventory in various product  package and speed configurations to meet forecasted customer demand 
on the other hand  we also wish to minimize the handling costs associated with maintaining higher inventory levels and to fully realize the opportunities for cost reductions associated with architecture and manufacturing process advancements 
we continually strive to balance these two objectives to provide excellent customer response at a competitive cost 
property  plant and equipment during  we invested million in property and equipment compared to million in primary investments in fiscal were for land and building purchases  software and semiconductor design tools  test and manufacturing equipment at each of our manufacturing and test locations  and workstations and network infrastructure to support the increased level of business 
current liabilities current liabilities increased from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in accounts payable and deferred income on shipments to distributors 
the increase in accounts payable was a result of business expansion and the increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors was due to increased inventory build up at distributors  due to the higher sales in fiscal compared to fiscal long term debt and lines of credit in fiscal  we converted in full million convertible subordinated notes due for a total of million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we have credit facilities for million to meet occasional working capital requirements for our ireland manufacturing facility 
the other million revolving credit agreement expired on march  and we decided not to extend this line of credit 
at march   no borrowings were outstanding under the lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stockholders equity stockholders equity grew by in fiscal to  million 
the increase of million was attributable to million in net income  million related to the issuance of common stock from employee stock plans and the tax benefit from stock options  million from the stock issuance in connection with rocketchips acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and million related to the sale of put warrants 
the increases were offset by the million used to acquire treasury stock and million from unrealized loss on available for sale securities and our cumulative translation adjustment 
summary of liquidity we anticipate that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  the risk factors discussed below could affect our cash positions adversely 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities for investments to obtain additional wafer capacity  procurement of additional capital equipment and facilities  development of new products  and potential acquisitions of technologies or businesses that could complement our business 
we may use available cash or other sources of funding for such purposes 
factors affecting future operating results the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and cyclical market patterns 
cyclical market patterns are characterized by several factors  including 
reduced product demand  
limited visibility of demand for products beyond three months  
accelerated erosion of average selling prices  
tight capacity availability  
shortages of other electronic components  
excess inventory within the supply chain  and 
overbuilding of oem products  including communication infrastructure 
our results of operations are affected by several factors 
these factors include general economic conditions  conditions specific to technology companies and to the semiconductor industry in particular  decreases in average selling prices over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions by us  our competitors and others 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product in a timely manner  the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies  the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors  the impact of new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep declines in demand for others  and the inability to predict the success of our customers products in their markets 
market demand for our products  particularly for those most recently introduced  can be difficult to predict  especially in light of customers demands to shorten product lead times and minimize inventory levels 
shortages of other electronic components could lead to customers canceling orders for our products due to the inability to complete their end system 
unpredictable market demand could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient quantities of specified products or if our customers reduced demand cause them to slow orders of our products 
in addition  any difficulty in achieving targeted wafer production yields could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  the dynamics of the market make prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
due to these and other factors  our past results  including those described in this report  are much less reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older  more stable and mature industries 
based on the factors noted herein  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results 
our future success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key technical  sales  marketing and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
particularly important are those highly skilled design  process  product  software and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
sales and operations outside of the united states subject us to the risks associated with conducting business in foreign economic and regulatory environments 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we do significant business and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting those countries 
for example  we have sales and operations in asia pacific and japan 
past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected revenues  and such conditions may occur in the future 
while the recent weakness of the euro and yen against the dollar has had no material impact to our business  continued weakness could lead to adverse conditions from our european and japanese customers 
customers may face reduced access to capital and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 
in addition  our ability to sell at competitive prices may be diminished 
currency instability may increase credit risks as the weak currencies may impair our customers ability to repay existing obligations 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the near future 
our financial condition and results of operations are becoming increasingly dependent on the global economy 
any instability in worldwide economic environments could lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers 
additional risks to us include government regulation of exports  imposition of tariffs and other potential trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods 
moreover  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts in taiwan where our main foundry partner  umc  as well as a significant number of suppliers to the semiconductor industry  end customers and contract manufacturers who provide manufacturing services worldwide  are located 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating specifically to the import or export of semiconductor products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the united states or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future or what effect  if any  such actions would have on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not manufacture our own silicon wafers 
presently  all of our wafers are manufactured by our foundry partners in taiwan by umc and in japan by seiko epson corp seiko 
we depend on our foundry partners to deliver reliable silicon wafers  with acceptable yields  in a timely manner 
if our foundry partners are unable to produce and deliver silicon wafers that meet our specifications  including acceptable yields  our results of operation could be adversely affected 
our foundry partners in taiwan and japan and many of our operations in california are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent past 
should there be a major earthquake in our operating locations in the future  our operations  including our manufacturing activities  may be disrupted 
this type of disruption could result in our inability to ship products in a timely manner  thereby materially adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
our headquarters in san jose  california  performs design and test services for certain of the company s products 
these services require the continuous use of electrical power and  at times of high usage  we are susceptible to the electrical power outages occurring in california 
any prolonged periods of electrical blackouts in california could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to perform design and test services at our headquarters 
the securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
dependence upon independent manufacturers and subcontractors we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
during the past several years  most of our wafers have been manufactured by umc and seiko  with recent wafers also manufactured by usic until its merger into umc 
we are dependent upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and cost attributes which include transitioning to advanced manufacturing process technologies  producing wafers at acceptable yields and delivering them in a timely manner 
while the timeliness  yield and quality of wafer deliveries have met our requirements to date  we cannot guarantee that our wafer suppliers will not experience future manufacturing problems  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process technologies 
additionally  disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including natural disasters such as fires  floods  or earthquakes  as well as disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity  natural gas or water could cause delays in shipments of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are also dependent on subcontractors located in asia to provide semiconductor assembly services 
the more complex product design also requires more advanced assembling and packaging technology developed by our subcontractors 
any prolonged inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and cost attributes  adequate yields or timely delivery  or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply  could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our growth will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain additional wafer fabrication capacity and assembly services from suppliers that are cost competitive during a period of tight capacity availability 
we consider various alternatives in order to secure additional wafer capacity 
these alternatives include  without limitation  equity investments in  or loans  deposits  or other financial commitments to independent wafer manufacturers 
we also consider the use of contracts which commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
we are currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner 
however  at times we have been unable  and may in the future be unable  to fully satisfy customer demand because of production constraints  including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to provide materials and services to satisfy customer delivery dates  as well as our ability to process products for shipment 
in addition  a significant increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of such wafers 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on new products our success depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new products which address customer requirements and compete effectively on the basis of price  density  functionality  and performance 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including 
timely completion of new product designs  
ability to utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies including advanced mask making capability  
achieving acceptable yields  
ability to obtain advanced packaging  
availability of supporting software design tools  
utilization of predefined cores of logic  
market acceptance  and 
successful deployment of systems by our customers 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that our new products will achieve market acceptance 
revenues relating to our mature products are expected to decline in the future 
as a result  we will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products along with cost reductions on current products 
we rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and other price performance factors that enable us to increase revenues while maintaining consistent margins 
to the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner  or to the extent that our products do not achieve market acceptance at prices with higher margins  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition see competition discussed in item intellectual property we rely upon patent  copyright  trade secret  mask work and trademark law to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure that such intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  have asserted patent  copyright  and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us 
we cannot assure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  that assertions by third parties will not result in costly litigation or that we would prevail in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
see part i other information  item legal proceedings for a discussion of litigation between xilinx and altera corporation 
investment company act of the investment company act of regulates mutual funds and closed end investment companies that are traded on the public stock markets 
in january  as a result of usic s merger with umc see note to consolidated financial statements  we received approximately million shares of umc stock  which are publicly traded on the taiwan stock exchange 
our current holdings in umc equal approximately million shares as the result of a stock dividend in july see note to consolidated financial statements 
we view this investment in umc as an operating investment primarily intended to secure adequate wafer manufacturing capacity 
although from time to time we could be viewed as holding a larger portion of our assets in investment securities than is presumptively permitted by the act for a company not registered as an investment company due to the success of our investments  in particular umc  we believe we should not be considered an investment company under the act 
the act  and rules issued under it  contain provisions and set forth principles that are designed to differentiate true operating companies from companies that may be considered to have sufficient investment company like characteristics to require regulation by the act 
at this time  we believe that we qualify as an operating company under these provisions 
in the future  however  our situation may change which might require us to seek an alternate solution such as exemptive or no action relief from the sec 
euro currency beginning in  member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
during the three year transition  the euro will be available for non cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain legal tender 
we are continuing to assess the euro s impact on our business 
we are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle the conversion  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies  the legal and contractual implications of agreements  as well as reviewing our pricing strategies 
we expect that any additional modifications to our operations and systems will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe the conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully modify all systems and contracts to comply with euro requirements 
litigation we are currently engaged in several legal matters 
see legal proceedings in part i 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
the portfolio includes tax advantaged municipal bonds  tax advantaged auction rate preferred municipal bonds  commercial paper  and us treasury securities 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks 
our sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of processed silicon wafers from japanese foundries are primarily denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transactions are settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in the current period 
a adverse change in yen exchange rates based on historical average rate fluctuations would have had approximately a adverse impact on revenue for the twelve months ended in fiscal years we are also sharing the yen exchange rate risk with some of our japanese customers through risk sharing agreements 
as we will continue to have a net yen exposure in the near future  we will continue to mitigate the exposure through yen hedging contracts 
however  no currency forward contracts were outstanding for japanese yen as of march  as we plan to expand our ireland facility  we have four outstanding forward currency exchange contracts against euro with bank of america 
total value of contracts is us million 
the four contracts expire at various dates between may and september since we will continue to have euro currency exposure over the expansion period  we will continue to mitigate the exposure through euro hedging contracts 
our investments in several subsidiaries and in the umc securities are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at each month end during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
if permanent changes occur in exchange rates after an investment is made  the investment s value will increase or decrease accordingly 
these fluctuations are recorded within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
also  as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in other than local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations will occur
