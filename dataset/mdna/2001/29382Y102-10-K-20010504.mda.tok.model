management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and related notes thereto 
the company is the product of a reverse merger completed on august  with a wholly owned subsidiary of sorrento networks corporation 
this subsidiary was doing business as entrada networks 
we acquired all the outstanding capital of entrada networks for million of our common shares and issued an additional million shares for cash of million 
entrada networks obligation to its former parent of million was contributed to our capital as part of the merger 
as a result of the merger  the former parent of entrada networks held a majority interest in the combined entity  which was renamed entrada networks  inc from sync research  inc 
accordingly  the merger has been accounted for as a reverse merger  whereby entrada networks is deemed to have purchased sync  however sync remains the legal entity and registrant for security and exchange commission reporting purposes and the financial statements of the combined entity now reflect the historical financial information of entrada networks prior to august  subsequent to the merger the former parent of entrada networks has disposed of million of its shares of our common stock including those it distributed to its shareholders and currently holds approximately of our common shares outstanding 
our principal business is the business formerly operated by entrada networks  and in september  our board of directors concluded that the operations of our frame relay business segment would not contribute to our profitability or toward our goal of entering the storage area networking market space and adopted a formal plan to discontinue this business segment operated by sync 
our financial statements reflect the operations and financial position of the frame relay business segment as a discontinued operation for all periods reported 
unless otherwise specifically noted  this annual report refers to the entrada business and not to the former sync business

results of operations comparison of the years ended january  and january  net sales 
our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were million for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in net sales for fiscal resulted primarily from decreased sales to distributors of remote access and print server products  partially offset by increased sales to oems of networking adapter products 
the shift in sales toward oems reflects our focus on expanding sales to oems and the roll out of our new generation products 
we expect our net sales for the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately million to million 
we believe that we will have lower sales in early primarily due to adverse economic conditions worldwide and in our market segment in particular 
gross profit 
cost of sales consists principally of the costs of components  subcontract assembly from outside manufacturers  and in house system integration  quality control  final testing and configuration costs 
gross profit decreased to million for the fiscal from million for fiscal the gross profit of million for the fiscal is net of a million valuation adjustment comprising million for print servers  million for remote access servers and million for other legacy products 
our gross margin  excluding the valuation adjustment  decreased to for the fiscal year ended january  from for fiscal the decline in gross margins resulted from increased sales to oem customers that have lower margins than sales to distributors as well as transitions from legacy products in anticipation of the merger of sync and entrada networks 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  commissions to sales representatives  tradeshow expenses and travel expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the reduction in selling and marketing costs reflects personnel reductions resulting from the closure in may of our massachusetts facility as well as personnel reductions in anticipation of the merger of sync and entrada networks 
as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased to for fiscal  from for fiscal the increase in selling and marketing costs as a percentage of sales is due to lower sales for fiscal compared with the prior year 
we intend to increase expenditures for sales and marketing including the recruitment of additional sales and marketing personnel  the expansion of our domestic and international distribution channels and the establishment of strategic relationships 
in addition  we expect sales commissions to increase as we increase our sales volume 
engineering  research and development 
engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation related costs for engineering personnel  facilities costs  and materials used in the design  development and support of our technologies 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
engineering  research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased new product development costs  partially offset by cost savings achieved through the consolidation of facilities 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as we enter the san market space 
in addition  due to changing market conditions  we wrote off capitalized software development costs to research and development expenses of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
exclusive of the valuation allowance  engineering research and development expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  legal and accounting fees  public company costs  and allocable occupancy costs 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to costs incurred in fiscal relating to the establishment of our headquarters facility in san diego 
these additional expenses were partially offset by cost savings from the consolidation of our facilities as well as the elimination of  square feet of unused space leased at our annapolis junction  maryland facility 
as a result of the merger and establishment of our headquarters in san diego  we have added a layer of senior management and will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company  including the costs of proxies  mailing  annual reports and stockholders meetings 
these costs are incremental to our general and administrative costs and will continue indefinitely 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for fiscal include a million valuation reserve recorded against distributor receivables and million of costs associated with the closure of our massachusetts facility 
we reduced our staff by through the closure of our massachusetts facility and other personnel reductions associated with a shift in our business focus to oem sales as well as in anticipation of our merger with sync 
it is anticipated that the closure of the massachusetts facility will reduce annual operating expenses by at least million 
income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes for fiscal years and we have carry forwards of domestic federal net operating losses  which may be available  in part  to reduce future taxable income in the united states 
however  the internal revenue code limits the application of net operating loss carry forwards in the event of ownership changes of greater than 
we have had a change of ownership that will limit the amount of any net operating loss carry forward we may use in a particular year 
in addition  we provided a valuation allowance in full for our deferred tax assets as it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the assets will not be realized 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million for fiscal this represents the operating results of the former sync research  inc frame relay business based in irvine  california  for the five month period from september  through january  on september   after completion of the merger on august   we entered into a plan to discontinue the operations of the frame relay business segment

the estimated loss consists of million of goodwill recognized upon completion of the merger on august   million for obsolescent inventory  for vendor payables  of severance costs  million for lease termination and for various other estimated costs for disposal of the business segment 
results of operations comparison of the years ended january  and january  net sales 
net sales decreased to million  or by less than  for fiscal from million for fiscal while the sales to oems of our lan adapter product lines increased  this increase was offset by the decrease in the remote access and print server product lines during fiscal reflecting entrada s shift towards its new generation of products and the planned phase out of its legacy products 
gross profit

engineering  research and development 
engineering  research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in engineering  research and development expenses for fiscal was the result of a million reduction to the net book value of capitalized software development costs caused by changing market conditions partially offset by cost savings achieved through the consolidation of entrada s facilities 
exclusive of the valuation allowance  engineering research and development expenses for fiscal were of net sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of net sales  for fiscal from million  or of net sales  for fiscal this decrease is the result of cost savings achieved through the consolidation of entrada s various facilities as well as eliminating the  square feet of unused space leased at our annapolis junction  maryland facility 
income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes for fiscal years and we have carry forwards of domestic federal net operating losses  which may be available  in part  to reduce future taxable income in the united states 
however  due to potential adjustments to the net operating loss carry forwards as provided by the internal revenue code with respect to ownership changes  future availability of the tax benefits is not assured 
in addition  we provided a valuation allowance in full for our deferred tax assets as it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the assets will not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources the amounts included in our statement of cash flows for fiscal are not comparable to our fiscal amounts due to the inclusion of the former sync research  inc  for less than a full year 
readers should refer to sync s annual report on form k for information concerning sync 
we financed our operations before the merger through a combination of debt and non interest bearing advances from our former parent  sorrento networks corporation  a new jersey corporation 
at january   our working capital was million and cash and cash equivalents was million 
cash flow used in operations was million during the fiscal year ended january  compared with cash flow provided by operations of million for the fiscal year ended january  cash flow used in operations in fiscal reflects million of net loss from operations after adjustment for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization  and reserves  plus a million decrease in accounts payable  a million increase in gross inventories  and million in net cash used in discontinued operations 
during fiscal  our cash flow provided by operations reflected million of net income from operations after adjustment for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization  reserves and valuation allowances  plus a million increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a million increase in gross inventories 
to support our anticipated growth  we expect our selling and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods 
there can be no assurance that our available cash will be sufficient to fund such additional expenses 
our investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property  plant and equipment and software development costs 
we purchased million and million in equipment during the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
during fiscal we also acquired million of cash belonging to sync research 
during fiscal the investing activities also included million in software development costs 
we expect our investments in property and equipment will increase to support the anticipated growth of our operations and infrastructure 
our financing activities during the fiscal year ended january  provided cash flows of million  primarily in connection with the merger 
as part of the sync and entrada networks merger  we received million in cash in exchange for common stock 
additional sources of net cash provided by financing activities were million in net proceeds from short term borrowings from our credit facilities and million of non interest bearing advances from our former parent  net of repayments 
during fiscal financing activities provided cash flows of million which included million of net repayments on short term borrowings  million of proceeds net of repayments on long term debt financing and million of non interest bearing advances from our former parent  net of repayments 
we had a line of credit with coast business credit totaling a maximum of million  subject to limitations based on our receivables and inventories 
outstanding borrowings against this line of credit were million at january  our credit line was collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  and is guaranteed by sorrento networks corporation 
subsequent to january   the coast business credit credit arrangement was fully replaced with a credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the silicon valley bank credit facility has a maximum limit of million  subject to a limitation equal to of our eligible receivables plus the lesser of million or of the liquidation value of our eligible inventory 
borrowings under the credit line bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
in connection with the line of credit  we issued silicon valley bank five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the credit arrangement is subject to covenants regarding our tangible net worth  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
the silicon valley bank credit line features a lower interest rate and simpler administration 
we anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated capital requirements through fiscal we are currently pursuing external equity financing arrangements that would enhance our liquidity position in the coming years and enable us to accelerate the development of san products 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned including the need for additional working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
there can be no assurances that our working capital requirements will not exceed our ability to generate sufficient cash internally to support our requirements and that external financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 
effects of inflation and currency exchange rates we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results or on the prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
all of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in us dollars and to date our business has not been affected by currency fluctuations 
in the future  however  we could conduct business in several different countries and thus fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive in particular countries  leading to a reduction in sales in that country 
in addition  inflation in such countries could increase our expenses 
in the future  we may engage in foreign currency denominated sales or pay material amounts of expenses in foreign currencies and  in such event  may experience gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
as amended by sfas and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for financial statements with fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  effective in the current or future periods 
the adoption or future adoption of these standards has had or will have no material effects on our financial position or results of operations 
the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin clarifies the application of opinion no 
for a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december   or january  the adoption of this standard had no material effect  if any  on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which broadly addresses how companies report revenues in their financial statements 
staff accounting bulletin no 
b delayed the date of required adoption to october  management believes that adoption of this policy had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
other matters from time to time  we are involved in various other legal proceedings and claims incidental to the conduct of our business 
although it is impossible to predict the outcome of any outstanding legal proceedings  we believe that such legal proceedings and claims  individually and in the aggregate  are not likely to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk is the result of our need for periodic additional financing for our large operating losses and capital expenditures 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on debt financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt 
additionally  the interest rates charged by our present lenders adjust on the basis of the lenders prime rate 
all of our sales and expenses have been denominated in us dollars and to date our business has not been affected by currency fluctuations 
in the future  however  we could conduct business in several different countries and thus fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive in particular countries  leading to a reduction in sales in that country 
in addition  inflation in such countries could increase our expenses 
in the future  we may engage in foreign currency denominated sales or pay material amounts of expenses in foreign currencies and  in such event  may experience gains and losses due to currency fluctuations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by such fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize our currency exposure risks through working capital management and do not hedge our exposure to translation gains and losses related to foreign currency exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
investments held for other than trading purposes do not impose a material market risk 
we believe that the relatively moderate rate of inflation in the united states over the past few years and the relatively stable interest rates incurred on short term financing have not had a significant impact on our sales  operating results or prices of raw materials 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation or an upward trend in short term interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future should we require debt financing in the future
