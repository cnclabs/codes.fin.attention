item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on october   we purchased comstream holdings  inc a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware with an office currently located at sequence drive  san diego  california from spar aerospace limited spar  a canadian advanced technology company 
comstream is an international provider of digital transmission solutions for voice  data  audio and video applications with offices in the united states  singapore  indonesia  china and the united kingdom 
comstream recorded revenue of approximately million in fiscal we acquired comstream in an effort to expand our core business and to supplement our product lines with a number of viable developed products and superior quality products in the design stage  all of which have since been released for production 
in addition  we based our decision to acquire comstream on the strategic belief that the combined companies could compete more effectively and realize certain synergies 
we believe that our acquisition of comstream has had and will have a number of positive effects  including the following the combined annual revenue of radyne comstream for fiscal and was approximately million and million  respectively  versus radyne corp 
s stand alone revenue of approximately million 
this dramatic difference in size provides us with better control over prices and margins and enables us to compete in larger markets 
the acquisition has produced positive synergistic effects by combining radyne s newer product lines with comstream s established products and sales channels 
we have experienced positive results from the efforts of the comstream sales force as compared with our historic reliance on independent sales representatives 
the addition of comstream s technology in the satellite communications industry has strengthened our market share and provided new customers for our existing products 
while we viewed comstream s gross margins as excellent  its profitability had suffered from extremely high expenses 
during  we reduced comstream s recurring expenses by approximately  per month 
the continued efficiencies and restructuring of our product lines have resulted in significant cost savings 
we recorded the acquisition of comstream under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development  million was valued as purchased technology  which is being amortized over years  and million was recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized over ten years 
as a result of the settlement with spar  the amount of goodwill recorded in the transaction was reduced by  to million after amortization of  in the year ended december  we have included comstream s results in our combined statements of operations from the acquisition date 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of armer communications engineering services  inc armer for an aggregate purchase price of  million consisting of  million in cash and  shares of common stock of the company 
the fair value of the stock was determined based on the average market price of the stock over a reasonable period of time before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
armer specializes in innovative solutions for the integration and installation of turnkey satellite communications systems 
this acquisition has been recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately  and has been recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over twelve years

in connection with the acquisition of comstream  we allocated  of the purchase price to seven in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted future cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
this allocation was based on a number of assumptions  including those regarding estimated project completion dates and costs 
as of the year ended december   all of the seven projects have been completed 
the original cost estimates remain essentially accurate and no other material variations in the assumptions have appeared

impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or expenses during the last four fiscal periods reported on herein 
accounting matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income loss 
proper accounting for changes in fair value of derivatives held is dependent on whether the derivative transaction qualifies as an accounting hedge and on the classification of the hedge transaction 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
this statement amended the effective date of sfas no 
to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on the company 
the financial accounting standards board issued a proposed statement of accounting standards  business combinations and intangible assets accounting for goodwill 
the proposed statement would prohibit goodwill amortization and establish a new method of testing goodwill for impairment 
the proposed statement would also prohibit the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations and establish a new accounting standard for goodwill acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of the proposed statement would be effective for fiscal quarters beginning after the issuance of the final statement 
the impact of the statement may be significant if it is issued as currently proposed  as we would be required to test our goodwill for impairment under new standards and would no longer recognize goodwill amortization expense 
this would have the effect of reducing our operating expenses 
in  we incurred million in goodwill amortization expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk on our financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
as of december   a change in interest rates would  over a year s period  have a potential pretax impact of  which is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements
