elcom services group  inc elcom services group markets and sells it products and professional services to enterprise business clients which typically require specialized services 
primarily due to declining gross profit margins with certain large customers and increasing inventory risks in  the company introduced a strategy for elcom services group to reduce its revenues and related inventory exposure by declining to do business with clients that have not paid the company on time as per agreements  or demanded pricing which the company was not willing to provide due to many factors  including decreases in marketing development funding from various manufacturers 
this strategy has resulted in a significant and planned decrease in revenues in compared to  but has effectively eliminated a majority of the companys marginal clients and exposure thereto 
elcom services groups revenues and resultant gross profit are affected by price reductions and decreases in vendor support programs offered by computer manufacturers 
consequently  in order to increase gross profit  the company must sell incremental amounts of pcs to offset such price reductions which amplifies the impact of any slowdown in corporate client demand on the companys gross profit 
although these manufacturer cutbacks have been substantial over the last several years  elcom services group has increased its gross profit margin in  primarily due to its aforementioned strategy of declining to do business with clients that demand unacceptable pricing 
manufacturers price reductions require elcom services group to increase its base unit volumes and associated peripheral product sales to overcome the effect of such price decreases if it is to sustain its level of gross profit dollars 
the company experienced a softening of demand from its clients that began in the third quarter of  which  at that time  the company attributed to the asian financial crisis and related uncertainties in worldwide financial markets  that impacted some of the companys clients capital spending programs 
the company believes that the relatively soft demand  which continued during and related to many factors  including year concerns as well as a general slow down seen in the business pc markets 
elcom services groups gross margins may vary from quarter to quarter  depending on the level of key vendor support programs  including rebates  return policies and price protection  as well as product mix  pricing strategies and other factors 
as a result of the outsourcing agreement with tech data described herein  the companys it product revenues will begin to reflect more transaction oriented fees  which are related to the amount of gross profit generated on it product sales
