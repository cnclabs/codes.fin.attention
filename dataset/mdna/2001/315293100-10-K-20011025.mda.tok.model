selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail distribution of propane  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
other factors affecting the results of operations include competitive conditions  demand for product  timing of acquisitions  variations in the weather and fluctuations in propane prices 
on december   the partnership purchased thermogas from a subsidiary of williams 
thus the first and second quarters of fiscal year varied significantly from those same quarters in fiscal during fiscal  the wholesale cost of propane increased significantly compared to fiscal the wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon in fiscal compared to an average of per gallon in fiscal other major supply points in the united states experienced similar increases 
this significant cost increase together with the thermogas acquisition were the major factors causing the increase in the partnership s revenues and cost of product sold in the first and second quarters of fiscal as compared to fiscal the significant wholesale cost increase is the primary factor causing the increase in the partnership s revenues and cost of product sold in the third quarter of fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal included a full year effect of the thermogas acquisition  while fiscal included seven and one half months results from the effect of the thermogas acquisition 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  certain amounts included in the four quarterly periods ended july  and the three quarterly periods ended april  have been reclassified to conform to the quarterly period ended july  presentation 
due to net earnings loss variations between quarters within a fiscal year combined with the issuance of common units in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the individual quarterly earnings per common unit in fiscal reported below will not sum to the earnings per common unit for the year ended fiscal reported in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in thousands  except per unit data fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per common unit basic and diluted fiscal year ended july  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per common unit basic and diluted results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  gas liquid and related product sales 
total gas liquids and related product sales increased to  primarily due to an increased average sales price per gallon and increased retail sales volumes 
the average sales price per gallon increased due to the effect of a significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane during fiscal  which was significantly higher as compared to fiscal the wholesale market price at one of the major supply points  mt 
belvieu  texas  averaged per gallon this period in fiscal as compared to an average of per gallon in same period of fiscal other major supply points in the united states also experienced significant increases 
retail sales volumes increased to  gallons in fiscal as compared to  gallons for the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of thermogas completed in december and the effect of colder weather  partially offset by the impact of customer conservation caused by the higher product cost environment 
during the winter heating season of fiscal  temperatures as reported by the american gas association were colder than normal as compared to temperatures warmer than normal during the same period in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit increased to  primarily due to increased retail margins  the effect on sales related to the colder than normal weather and the acquired thermogas operations  partially offset by risk management gains realized in the first half of fiscal that were greater than during the first half of fiscal see note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding risk management activities and the accounting for derivatives 
operating expense 
operating expense increased to  primarily due to operating expenses related to the acquired thermogas operations and to a lesser extent the increased cost of incentives resulting from the improved financial performance of the partnership 
this increase was partially offset by favorable expense management related to the completed integration of the thermogas acquisition and expense savings initiatives established late in fiscal year general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to  primarily due to incentives resulting from the improved financial performance of the company as compared to last year and due to expenses incurred related to business process reviews 
prior to the acquisition by the partnership  thermogas incurred in excess of  in general and administrative expenses per year 
as a result of ferrellgas acquisition of thermogas and the complete integration of the general and administrative services into the ferrellgas operations  ferrellgas has been able to eliminate approximately of these overhead costs  thus realizing the expected general and administrative cost reduction from the acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  primarily due to the change in the estimated residual values of customer and storage tanks  partially offset by the depreciation and amortization expense from the addition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets from the thermogas acquisition 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the partnership increased the estimate of the residual values of its existing customer and storage tanks 
this increase in the residual values resulted from a review by management of its tank values established through an independent tank valuation obtained in connection with a financing completed in december due to this change in the tank residual values  depreciation expense decreased by approximately  compared to the depreciation that would have been recorded using the previously estimated residual values 
the change in estimated residual values will continue to affect future depreciation expense as compared to the depreciation that would have been recorded using the previously estimated residual values 
equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense increased to  due to the addition of the  operating leases in december  and to a lesser extent to upgrades to the partnership s truck fleet 
loss gain on disposal of assets and other 
loss on disposal of assets and other increased  primarily due to the loss on disposal of fixed assets and losses related to the transfer of accounts receivables pursuant to the accounts receivable securitization 
see note e in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the accounts receivable securitization 
other charges 
on april   ferrellgas partners announced a series of transactions that increased the cash distribution coverage to its public unitholders and modified the structure of its outstanding senior units 
see additional discussion of this transaction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing activities 
ferrellgas partners recognized  in banking  legal and other fees related to these transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  this increase is primarily the result of increased borrowings related to the thermogas acquisition  partially offset by the effect of the reduced credit facility borrowings during fiscal and the interest rate savings resulting from an interest rate swap arrangement in effect during most of the fiscal year 
in june  the interest rate swap agreement was terminated by the counterparty 
the reduced credit facility borrowings resulted primarily from the funds generated from the accounts receivable securitization facility 
see discussion of the transactions between the partnership and ferrellgas receivables in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
forward looking statements 
the partnership does not expect a similar magnitude of percentage increase in retail volumes  revenues  cost of product sold or expenses in fiscal these percentage increases experienced in this fiscal year compared to the prior year were primarily a result of the impact of the acquisition of thermogas  the significantly higher wholesale propane prices experienced during fiscal compared to last year  and colder winter temperatures this year compared to last year 
also contributing to the gross profit percentage increases this fiscal year were a strong margin environment and favorable product purchasing and risk management operations 
the interest rate swap was terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  therefore  the related interest expense savings may not be repeated 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  gas liquid and related product sales 
total gas liquids and related product sales increased to  in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of thermogas sales and increased sales price per gallon 
the fiscal winter was reported as the warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than the fiscal winter as reported by the american gas association 
sales price per gallon increased due to the effect of the significant increase in the wholesale cost of propane as compared to fiscal retail volumes increased to  gallons in fiscal as compared to  gallons for fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of thermogas partially offset by the effect of warmer weather 
other revenues increased by  primarily due to the acquisition effect of thermogas on increased appliance and material sales  tank rental and service labor 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  in fiscal as compared to  during fiscal  primarily due to gross profit generated from the acquired thermogas operations and  to a lesser extent  increased favorable risk management results  partially offset by lower retail margins 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding risk management activities and the accounting for derivatives 
fiscal s retail margins benefited significantly from a low wholesale cost environment 
that cost environment was not repeated during fiscal in addition  while the wholesale cost of propane rapidly increased during the year  the retail sales price lagged the cost increase which caused retail margins to decrease 
operating expense 
operating expense increased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal primarily due to personnel  plant and office  vehicle and other operating expenses incurred by the acquired thermogas operations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal to  as compared to  for fiscal primarily due to the addition of intangibles and property  plant and equipment from the thermogas acquisition 
equipment lease expense 
equipment lease expense increased by  in fiscal due primarily to the addition of operating leases  and to a lesser extent to increased operating leases related to new vehicles and computers acquired for retail locations 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the operating leases 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased borrowings related to the thermogas acquisition and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the overall average interest rate paid by the partnership 
as a result of the thermogas acquisition  ferrellgas  lp assumed  in debt and also refinanced a portion of its existing revolving credit facility balances 
on february   ferrellgas  lp issued  of fixed rate senior notes which have maturities ranging from to and an average interest rate of in order to repay the  in assumed debt 
the additional  in borrowings was used to fund debt issuance costs 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
due to the seasonality of the retail propane distribution business  a significant portion of the partnership s cash flow from operations is typically generated during the winter heating season which occurs during the partnership s second and third fiscal quarters 
typically  the partnership generates significantly lower cash flows from operations in its first and fourth fiscal quarters as compared to the second and third quarters  because fixed costs exceed gross profit during the non peak season 
however  the third and fourth quarters of fiscal generated higher than historical cash flow from operating activities and the second quarter of fiscal generated lower than historical cash flow from operating activities 
this variance between these quarters in the amount of cash flow from operating activities compared to historical levels was primarily caused by significant increases in customer receivables related to the significantly higher than historical retail prices  increases in retail volumes  and  to a lesser extent  by increases in the cost of propane inventory during the first half of the year 
as a result of the lower cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter  the partnership generated higher than normal cash flow from operating activities in the third and fourth quarters as customers remitted payment of the receivables invoiced during the second quarter of fiscal subject to meeting certain financial tests discussed below  the general partner believes that ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds available to meet its obligations  and to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient funds to permit ferrellgas partners to meet its obligations with respect to the  senior secured notes 
in addition  the general partner believes that ferrellgas  lp will have sufficient funds available to distribute to ferrellgas partners sufficient cash to pay the required quarterly distribution on the senior units and the minimum quarterly distribution on all common units during fiscal see financing activities for additional information about the increased cash distribution coverage to ferrellgas partners publicly held common unitholders 
the partnership s credit facilities  public debt  private debt  accounts receivable securitization facility and operating tank leases contain several financial tests and covenants restricting the partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur debt and engage in certain other business transactions 
in general  these tests are based on the partnership s debt to cash flow ratio and cash flow to interest expense ratio 
ferrellgas  inc believes that the most restrictive of these tests currently are debt incurrence limitations within the credit facility  operating tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility and limitations on the payment of distributions within the ferrellgas partners senior secured notes 
the credit facility  operating tank leases and accounts receivable securitization facility limit ferrellgas  lp s ability to incur debt if ferrellgas  lp exceeds prescribed ratios of either debt to cash flow or cash flow to interest expense 
ferrellgas partners senior secured notes restrict payments if a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense is not met 
this restriction places limitations on the partnership s ability to make certain restricted payments such as the payment of cash distributions to unitholders 
the cash flow used to determine these financial tests generally is based upon the partnership s most recent cash flow performance giving pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestitures made during the test period 
although fiscal financial performance was favorably impacted by colder temperatures  the partnership s financial performance during the  and fiscal years was adversely impacted by average temperatures that were reported by the national oceanic atmospheric administration as the warmest in recorded history 
despite these challenges in prior fiscal years  the partnership met all of its financial tests and covenants during these previous years and fiscal based upon current estimates of the partnership s cash flow  ferrellgas  inc believes that the partnership will be able to meet all of the required quarterly financial tests and covenants 
however  if the partnership were to encounter unexpected downturns in business operations in the future  such as significantly warmer than normal weather or a volatile cost environment  the partnership may not meet certain financial tests in future quarters 
these factors could temporarily restrict the ability of ferrellgas  lp to incur debt or ferrellgas partner s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders 
depending on the circumstances  the partnership may consider alternatives to permit the incurrence of debt at ferrellgas  lp or the continued payment by ferrellgas partners of the quarterly cash distribution to its unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives can or will be implemented with respect to any given quarter 
future maintenance and working capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances  the credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility 
to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  ferrellgas  lp may borrow on the existing credit facility  ferrellgas partners or ferrellgas  lp may issue additional debt to the extent permitted under existing debt agreements or ferrellgas partners may issue additional equity securities  including  among others  common units 
toward this purpose  on february   ferrellgas partners filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission permitting the delayed sale of up to  in equity and or debt securities 
these registered securities would be available for issuance by the partnership in the future to fund acquisitions  to reduce indebtedness or to fund general corporate purposes 
on june   ferrellgas partners received  after underwriting discounts  commission and expenses  from the issuance of  common units to the public from this shelf registration statement 
see financing activities for additional information regarding this equity offering 
ferrellgas partners also maintains an additional shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of up to  common units 
these common units may be issued by ferrellgas partners only in connection with the partnership s acquisition of another business or the acquisition of properties or securities of another business in a business combination transaction 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this increased cash provided by operations is primarily due to the increased earnings in fiscal investing activities 
on september   ferrellgas  lp entered into an account receivable securitization facility with bank one  na 
as part of this day facility  ferrellgas  lp transfers an interest in a pool of its trade accounts receivable to its wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  ferrellgas receivables  llc 
ferrellgas receivables then sold its interest to a commercial paper conduit of banc one  na 
ferrellgas  lp remits daily to ferrellgas receivables funds collected on the pool of trade receivables held by ferrell receivables 
this facility was renewed effective september  for a one year commitment with banc one  na at july   ferrellgas  na had collected and remitted to ferrellgas receivables all but  of the receivables previously sold to it 
additionally  ferrellgas  lp had invested  of cash into ferrellgas receivables related to this facility 
the level of funding available from this accounts receivable facility agreement is currently limited to  see note e in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions 
during the twelve months ended july   the partnership made acquisitions of three businesses with an aggregate value of  the purchase was funded by  of cash payments and the issuance of  of notes payable to the seller 
in fiscal  the partnership had accrued  in involuntary employee termination benefits and exit costs  which it expected to incur within twelve months from the acquisition date as it implemented the integration of the thermogas operations 
this accrual included  of termination benefits and  of costs to exit thermogas activities 
the partnership paid  and  for termination benefits and  and  for exit costs in fiscal years and  respectively 
the remaining liability for termination benefits and exit costs was reduced in fiscal by  as an adjustment to goodwill 
during fiscal  the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  consisting primarily of o vehicle lease buyouts  o relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  o upgrading computer equipment and software  and o additions to propane storage tanks and cylinders 
historically  the partnership s capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment have been relatively low due to limited technological change and long useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders 
the partnership has recently completed a review of its key business processes to identify areas where it can use technology and process enhancements to improve its operations 
specifically  the partnership has identified areas where it can reduce operating expenses and improve customer satisfaction in the near future 
these areas under review include improvements to the routing and scheduling of customer deliveries  customer administration and operational workflow 
during fiscal  the partnership expects to allocate considerable resources toward these improvements and intends to fund the necessary capital requirements primarily from excess cash from operations generated during fiscal the partnership leases computers and light and medium duty trucks  tractors and trailers 
the partnership believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting its transportation and technology equipment needs 
the partnership purchased  of vehicles whose lease terms expired in fiscal or would have expired in fiscal the partnership plans to purchase additional vehicles and computers at the end of their lease term totaling  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the partnership intends to renew other vehicle and tank leases that would have had buyouts of  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal historically  the partnership has been successful in renewing leases subject to buyouts 
however  there is no assurance that it will be successful in the future 
the large amount to be renewed in fiscal  primarily relates to the operating tank leases entered into at the time of the thermogas acquisition 
these two leases have terms that expire june  and the partnership intends to exercise its option on the two additional one year periods  if such extension is approved by the lessor 
at the end of the renewal dates  the partnership intends to secure additional financing in order to either lease or purchase the related tanks 
see note j in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these leases 
the partnership continues to consider opportunities to expand its operations through strategic acquisitions of retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
financing activities 
on june   the partnership received  net of issuance costs  pursuant to the issuance of  common units to the public 
the partnership then used these proceeds to redeem  senior units  to pay the related accrued senior unit distribution and to pay related issuance fees 
after the completion of these transactions  the exercise of  common unit options and an additional redemption of  senior units in july  the partnership had outstanding  common units and  senior units 
the common units issued to the public on june   and common units issued pursuant to options exercised in the fourth quarter of fiscal  are entitled to a distribution equivalent to the distribution expected to be paid to the already outstanding publicly held common units for the quarter ended july  on april   the partnership announced a series of transactions that increased the cash distribution coverage to its public common unitholders and modified the structure of its outstanding senior units 
in addition  the partnership announced that an entity owned by the general partner s chairman  chief executive officer and president  james e 
ferrell  purchased all its outstanding senior units from williams for a purchase price of  plus any accrued and unpaid distributions 
the senior units are now paid quarterly cash distributions from ferrellgas partners equivalent to percent per annum of the liquidating value 
the senior units are redeemable by the partnership at any time  in whole or in part  upon payment in cash of the liquidating value of the senior units  currently per unit  plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions 
the holder of the senior units has the right  subject to certain events and conditions  to convert any outstanding senior units into common units at the earlier of december  or upon the occurrence of a material event as defined by the partnership agreement 
such conversion rights are contingent upon the partnership not previously redeeming such securities 
also ferrell companies granted the partnership the ability to defer future distributions on the common units held by it up to an aggregate outstanding amount of  until december  ferrellgas  lp s credit facility  which expires june   is unsecured and consists of a  working capital  general corporate and acquisition facility  including a letter of credit sub facility  and a  revolving working capital facility 
this  facility is subject to an annual reduction in outstanding balances to zero for thirty consecutive days 
all borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at the borrower s option  at a rate equal to either london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin varying from percent to percent or the bank s base rate plus an applicable margin varying from percent to percent 
the bank s base rate at july  and july  was and  respectively 
during fiscal  the partnership repaid  of its credit facility 
at july   no borrowings and  of letters of credit were outstanding under the ferrellgas  lp credit facility 
effective july   the credit facility was amended to increase the letter of credit sub facility availability from  to  at july   ferrellgas  lp had  available for general corporate  acquisition and working capital purposes under the credit facility 
based on the pricing grid contained in the credit facility  the current borrowing rate for future borrowings under the credit facility is libor plus 
the partnership believes that these facilities will be sufficient to meet its future working capital needs 
however  if the partnership were to experience an unexpected significant increase in working capital requirements  it could exceed its immediately available resources 
events that could cause increases in working capital requirements include a significant increase in the cost of propane  a significant delay in the collections of accounts receivable or increased volatility in commodity prices related to risk management activities 
the partnership would consider alternatives to provide increased working capital 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives could be implemented 
effective june   ferrellgas  lp entered into an interest rate cap agreement with bank of america  related to variable quarterly rent payments due pursuant to two tank lease agreements 
the variable quarterly rent payments are determined based upon a floating libor based interest rate 
the cap agreement  which expires june   requires bank of america to pay ferrellgas  lp at the end of each march  june  september and december the excess  if any  of the applicable three month floating libor interest rate over a cap of  applied to the unamortized amount outstanding each quarter under the two operating tank lease agreements 
the total obligation under these two operating tank lease agreements as of july  was  the ferrellgas partners  senior secured notes  issued in april and due june  became redeemable at the option of ferrellgas partners  in whole or in part  at any time after june  the partnership does not currently plan to exercise its option to redeem these notes  in whole or in part  however  there can be no assurance the partnership will not exercise this option 
effective april   the partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america  related to the semi annual interest payment due on these notes 
the swap agreement  which was terminated at the option of bank of america on june   required bank of america to pay the stated fixed interest rate annual rate equaling  every six months due on each june and december in exchange  the partnership was required to make quarterly floating interest rate payments on the th of march  june  september and december based on an annual interest rate equal to the three month libor interest rate plus applied to the same notional amount of  the partnership resumed paying the stated fixed interest rate annual rate effective june  on february   ferrellgas  lp issued  of privately placed unsecured senior notes

on december   the partnership purchased thermogas from a subsidiary of williams 
part of the consideration paid to williams at closing by the partnership was  in newly issued senior units 
on april   these units were acquired by an entity owned by james e 
ferrell  the general partner s chairman  chief executive officer and president 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  ferrellgas partners  lp redeemed  senior units and intends to redeem the remaining  senior units at the redemption value prior to the date of conversion 
no assurances can be given that the partnership will be successful in selling additional equity or securing the financing to redeem the remaining senior units 
on december   ferrellgas  lp entered into a  operating lease involving the sale leaseback of a portion of its customer tanks with banc of america leasing capital  llc 
this operating lease has a term that expires june  and may be extended for two additional one year periods at the option of ferrellgas  lp  if such extension is approved by the lessor 
on december   immediately prior to the closing of the thermogas acquisition  thermogas entered into a  operating lease involving a portion of its customer tanks  with banc of america leasing capital  llc 
in connection with the acquisition of thermogas  ferrellgas  lp assumed all obligations under the  operating lease  which have terms and conditions similar to the december    operating lease discussed above 
the partnership intends to renew both leases for the two additional one year periods  subject to lessor approval 
following the renewal periods  the partnership intends to refinance these leases  however  there can be no assurance that the partnership will be successful in obtaining this refinancing or lessor approval for the renewals

the senior notes include five series with maturities ranging from year through at an average fixed interest rate of 
on september   the partnership paid cash distributions of per senior unit and per common unit 
adoption of new accounting standards 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requirements include  among other things  that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
it applies to all business combinations initiated after june  the partnership has historically accounted for business combinations using the purchase method  therefore  this new standard will not have a substantial impact on how the partnership accounts for future combinations 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  including the requirement that goodwill and some intangible assets no longer be amortized 
also some intangibles will be reclassified to goodwill 
the partnership has elected to adopt sfas no 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal although there will be no cash flow effect  the partnership believes its amortization expense will decrease by  in fiscal  compared to the amortization that would have been recorded had the new accounting standard not been issued 
this new standard also requires the partnership to test goodwill for impairment at the time the standard is adopted and also on an annual basis 
the partnership believes that the results of the initial impairment test of goodwill performed at the time the standard is adopted will not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability if a company has a legal or contractual financial obligation in connection with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
the partnership expects to implement sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and is currently assessing its effect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sfas no 
modifies the financial accounting and reporting for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the partnership expects to implement sfas no 
beginning in the fiscal year ending july   and is currently assessing its effect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the partnership s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
the partnership s risk management trading activities utilize certain types of energy commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange to anticipate market movements  manage and hedge its exposure to the volatility of floating commodity prices and to protect its inventory positions 
the partnership s risk management activities  other than trading  also utilizes certain over the counter energy commodity forward contracts and options to limit overall price risk and to hedge its exposure to inventory price movements 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily by senior management for compliance with the partnership s trading and other than trading risk management policies 
these policies include specific dollar exposure limits  limits on the term of various contracts and volume limits for various energy commodities 
the partnership also utilizes loss limits and daily review of open positions to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market  credit and liquidity risk 
new york mercantile exchange traded futures are guaranteed by the new york mercantile exchange and have nominal credit risk 
the partnership is exposed to credit risk associated with forwards  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  the partnership analyzes its financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of each limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
in order to minimize the liquidity risk of cash  margin or collateral requirements of counterparties for over the counter instruments  the partnership attempts to balance maturities and positions with individual counterparties 
sensitivity analysis 
the partnership has prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of its energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options were analyzed assuming a hypothetical change in prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities is estimated at  and  for trading and  and  for other than trading activities as of july  and  respectively 
the preceding hypothetical analysis is limited because changes in prices may or may not equal  thus  actual results may differ 
additionally  the partnership seeks to mitigate its variable rate interest rate risk exposure on operating leases by entering into interest rate cap agreements 
at july   the partnership had no variable rate debt   outstanding in variable rate operating leases and an equal amount of interest rate cap agreements outstanding to hedge the related variable rate exposure
