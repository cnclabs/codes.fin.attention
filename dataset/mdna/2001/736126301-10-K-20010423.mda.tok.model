overview portal develops  markets and supports business infrastructure software to manage next generation communications and e services 
portal was incorporated in california in march as portal information network  inc in december  portal communications company  a predecessor company that was founded in  was merged with and into portal information network  inc portal communications company operated a proprietary  network based on line system  provided internet access and hosted private label on line services from its inception until when these services were discontinued and the individual customers were sold to sprint corporation 
in october  portal information network  inc changed its name to portal software  inc 
in april  portal reincorporated in delaware 
in late  we began focusing on developing and marketing real time cm b software for the internet and other next generation communications and e services 
the first generally available version of the product  named infranet  was shipped in may beginning with fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have come from the license of one product  infranet and from related services 
revenues consist of infranet license  consulting  training  support and maintenance fees 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or multiyear license fees  which are primarily derived from contracts with corporate customers and resellers 
we believe that future license revenues will be generated from three sources 
license fees from new customers  
license fees for new products to existing customers  and 
growth in the subscriber base of its existing customers  which will lead to increased revenue from subscriber based licenses 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant portal obligations with regard to implementation exist or remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for electronic delivery  the software is considered to have been delivered when we have provided the customer with the access codes that allow for immediate possession of the software 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users resellers is not recognized until evidence of an arrangement with an end user has been received 
services revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from systems integration or other consulting fees  maintenance agreements and training 
arrangements that include software services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when software services are considered essential  revenue under the arrangement is recognized using contract accounting 
when software services are not considered essential  the revenue related to the software services is recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance agreements provide for technical support and include the right to unspecified upgrades on an if and when available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized  as services revenue  on a straight line basis over the life of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
our cost of license fees includes a royalty payment for third party technology included in infranet 
resellers commissions are also included in cost of license fees when we are paid directly by a customer for a contract originated by a systems integrator 
agreements with some of the integrators require us to make a payment equal to a percentage of the license and maintenance revenues recognized 
we essentially did not incur any shipping  packaging or documentation costs  as our product was delivered electronically over the internet 
cost of services consists primarily of headcount related expenses  costs related to outside consultants  travel and overhead associated with delivering consulting and training and providing support to our customers 
amortization of purchased developed technology arises from the acquisition of solution and is related to purchasing developed technology in the amount of million 
the value is being amortized over its estimated useful life of years 
we have a limited operating history as a software company 
we incurred a net loss of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues from licenses of our products to achieve and maintain operating profitability 
we have generated our historical infranet revenues from more than customers through march  we have established a series of relationships with hardware platform  software and service providers and systems integrators 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from customers that have significant relationships with our market and platform partners 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period

total revenues increased by approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal license fees revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues  for both periods  primarily due to increased license sales as a result of the maturation of the infranet product and the expansion of our sales and marketing operations 
no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenues for the years ended january  or one customer accounted for of total revenues for the year ended january  license fees totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
license fees increased by approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in license fees  for both periods  was primarily due to continued expansion of our marketing activities and growth in our sales force as well as greater demand for and acceptance of infranet 
services revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
service revenues increased by approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in services revenues  for both years  resulted from the increase in consulting  training  support and maintenance service fees related to the growth in new customers and to new implementations of infranet and the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by existing customers

international revenues increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal european revenues increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal intercontinental revenues increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in international revenues  for both periods  was primarily due to the growth of our direct sales force and increased marketing efforts worldwide 
expenses cost of license fees cost of license fees consists of resellers commission payments to systems integrators and third party royalty obligations 
cost of license fees was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cost of license fees increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in cost of license fees  for both periods  is primarily due to increased license revenue and increased resellers commissions resulting from expanding our base of systems integrator partners 
gross margin for license fees was approximately  and in fiscal  and for the years ended january   and  we essentially did not incur any shipping  packaging or documentation costs  as our product was delivered electronically over the internet 
cost of services cost of services primarily consists of maintenance  consulting and training expenses 
cost of services was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cost of services increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in cost of services  for both periods  is primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting and technical support personnel necessary to support both the expansion of our installed base of customers and new implementations 
gross margin for services was approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal the decrease in gross margin  during fiscal  was primarily due to the costs associated with the acquisition and assimilation of solution gross margin for services was approximately in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal the increase in gross margin  during fiscal  was primarily due to a decrease in the use of higher cost third party personnel as a result of the hiring of additional employees for our consulting business 
we expect cost of services to increase in the future as a result of increased demand for services 
amortization of purchased developed technology in fiscal  we recorded an asset of million for purchased developed technology as a result of acquiring solution see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined  with the assistance of independent third party appraisers  by estimating the present value of cash flows from developed technology as based on management and industry assumptions and market data 
this purchased developed technology is being amortized  on a straight line basis  over its estimated useful life of four years 
amortization of purchased developed technology will continue to negatively impact our operating results in the future 
amortization expense is estimated to be million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for our development and certain technical support efforts 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and research and development expenses increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in research and development  for both periods  was primarily due to an increase in the number of research and development personnel necessary to support both expanded functionality of infranet and increases in our quality assurance and product publications operations 
we currently believe our investment in research and development will increase in the future as we hire additional research and development employees 
we have not capitalized any software development costs to date 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force  marketing staff and marketing programs  including trade shows  advertising and costs associated with the recruitment of new and maintenance of existing  strategic partnerships 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal years  and sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses  for both periods  was due to a number of factors  including an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel  the opening of new sales offices worldwide and increased marketing programs 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel  increase spending on marketing programs and establish sales offices in additional domestic and international locations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  legal  human resources and facilities  as well as information system expenses not allocated to other departments 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or in fiscal from and approximately million or in fiscal from fiscal the increase for both periods was primarily due to a higher number of general and administrative personnel and to additional legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with business activities 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we hire additional general and administrative personnel and continue to incur greater legal and accounting costs in connection with expanding business activities 
amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in fiscal  representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire certain shares of common stock during fiscal and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of approximately million  million and million during the years ended january   and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to options awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 
total deferred compensation at january  of approximately million is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options  which is generally years  using a graded vesting method 
the amortization of deferred compensation remaining as of january   is estimated to be million in fiscal and million in fiscal in process research and development in fiscal  we recorded a one time charge of million for in process research and development projects  related to the acquisition of solution  for which technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the acquisition  the total fair value of these projects was estimated to be million 
the value of the projects was determined  with the assistance of independent third party appraisers  by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into commercially feasible products and estimating the present value of the net cash flows management believed would result from the products 
amortization of goodwill goodwill  as related to the acquisition of solution  accounted for approximately and of total assets and stockholders equity  respectively  as of january  in fiscal year  amortization expense of goodwill was million 
goodwill amortization expense related to the completed acquisition will continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in future periods 
assuming we do not experience any impairment of value of goodwill that would require an acceleration of amortization  amortization expense is estimated to be million for fiscal  million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal interest and other income  net interest and other income includes interest and dividend income from cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments offset by interest expense paid on capital leases and notes payable 
interest and other income was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income  for fiscal  includes a million one time gain upon remeasurement of the liability related to the put option granted to accenture  which was settled upon the completion of our initial public offering in may see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal and increased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from the initial and secondary stock offerings  done in may and october  being invested for a full year 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the one time gain upon remeasurement of the put option and interest income from the investment of funds received upon completion of the initial public offering 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision was million  million and million for fiscal  and the income tax provision for fiscal and primarily relates to foreign withholding taxes on revenue and tax on earnings generated from operations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax provision for fiscal is the result of alternative minimum taxes  foreign withholding taxes on revenue  and tax on earnings generated from operations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets are more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  we have provided a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments including restricted investments totaled million at january   compared to a balance of million at january  we generated million in cash from operations in the year ended january   an increase of million over the million generated in the year ended january  net cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily comprised of a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accrued compensation and an million increase in other accrued liabilities 
this was offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in prepaids and other current assets and a million increase in other assets 
net loss adjustments made for non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and amortization of deferred stock compensation amounted to million and million  respectively  for the year ended january  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended january  additionally  for the year ended january   net loss adjustments were made for non cash expenses related to the acquisition of solution see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss adjustments for in process research and development and the amortization of purchased developed technology and goodwill amounted to million and million  respectively 
we have continued to make significant investments in software  equipment and facilities 
during the year ended january   we purchased computer equipment and software  made leasehold improvements and purchased other capital equipment amounting to approximately million  primarily to support its ongoing and expanding operations and information systems 
of this amount  million was funded with capital leases 
we have raised equity capital from investors to fund our operations 
in fiscal  we raised an additional million from sales of common stock issued from our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of stock options by employees  net of repurchases 
in fiscal  we completed an initial public offering and concurrent private sales of stock to cisco systems  inc and accenture that collectively raised million 
we also completed a follow on offering in october  which raised approximately million  net of underwriting commissions and expenses 
during the same period  we raised an additional million from sales of common stock issued from our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of stock options by employees and warrants by third parties  net of repurchases 
in fiscal  we raised million from the exercise of warrants for preferred stock issued in connection with its capital lease line facility and its term loan and raised an additional million from sales of common stock  primarily upon exercise of stock options by employees 
historically  we have also used debt and leases to partially finance our operations and capital purchases 
we have a million capital lease line facility with an equipment lessor  which was established in fiscal the lease line has a term of months and bears interest at a rate of per annum 
separately  during the year ended january   we repaid an outstanding million term loan with a finance company 
the term loan was collateralized by substantially all of our assets  with the exception of new equipment purchased using funds provided by the capital lease line facility 
on april   we entered into a line of credit with a bank under which we may borrow up to million 
amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at a rate of the bank s prime rate plus and matured on april  portal declined to renew the line of credit on april  we borrowed million under the line of credit  which was used to repay the remaining million installment of the term loan  which matured in april the outstanding balance on the line of credit was repaid in may from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
we also converted a customer deposit for prepaid services into a million short term liability in fiscal this liability bore interest at a rate of per annum and was repaid in july in november  we acquired solution the liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition include short term and long term notes payable 
there are two short term notes  both of which bear interest at per annum and are unsecured 
one note does not require payments on the principal until june however  this note has been classified as short term as it our intention to pay off the note in fiscal the balance due as of january  is million 
the second note is due june and had a balance of million as of january  the long term notes payable are four mortgages for two facilities located in germany 
two of the mortgages accrue interest at per annum 
principal and interest are due in december and june on these two mortgages 
as of january   the balances due on these loans were million and million  respectively 
the other two mortgages accrue interest at and per annum 
principal and interest payments are made on a monthly basis 
these two mortgages are due in october and november as of january   the balances due are million and million  respectively 
the capital lease line facility comprised the entire amount of the debt obligations on our balance sheet as of january  the capital lease line facility includes certain covenants requiring minimum liquidity  tangible net worth and profitability over time and becomes due immediately if we fail to meet these covenants 
we have currently  and have always been  in compliance with these covenants 
on april   we agreed to enter into a strategic alliance with accenture under which accenture agreed to provide services to portal and the parties agreed to expand their existing marketing alliance and work closely together to expand their customer service and marketing relationship 
under this agreement  we agreed to pay accenture for its services a minimum services fee in cash of million and a cash settled put for  of the shares which were purchased by accenture in a private placement concurrent with our initial public offering 
this put guaranteed a closing value of million at the end of the first day of trading 
because the closing value exceeded million  we were not required to make any payment related to this put 
the definitive agreement was entered into and the million payment was made in march the resulting intangible is being amortized over a period of approximately four and one half years  the term of the alliance  beginning in april in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and international locations 
during fiscal  we entered into two leases for our worldwide headquarters that expire in december in connection with these leases  we issued two letters of credit totaling million in lieu of a security deposit for the facilities see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with all leases  we will make payments of approximately million  million  million  million and million in the years ending january     and  respectively and a total of million thereafter until expiration of the leases 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing international operations and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to hire qualified personnel for our sales  support  marketing and product development organizations  to expand marketing programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and for other general corporate activities 
although we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  we may require additional financing within this time frame 
additional funding  if needed  may cause dilution to our stockholders or the incurrence of debt  and such funding not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas establishes methods for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities 
in june  the fasb delayed implementation of fas  so that implementation is now required for fiscal years beginning after june  as portal does not currently engage in hedging activities  portal expects that the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
due to the delayed effective date  portal will be required to implement fas for fiscal risks associated with portal s business and future operating results portal s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future and an investment in our common stock is subject to a variety of risks  including but not limited to the specific risks identified below 
inevitably  some investors in our securities will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the prices at which they purchase and sell securities 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described in this risks associated with portal s business and future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which reflect our management s view only as of the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to update these statements or publicly release the results of any revisions to the forward looking statements that we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
it is difficult to predict our business because we have a limited history operating as a provider of business infrastructure software the results of operations for the fiscal year ended january  contained in this report are not necessarily indicative of results for the fiscal year ending january  or any other future period 
moreover  portal has a relatively brief operating history as a provider of business infrastructure software and had no meaningful license revenue until therefore  portal will experience the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  including those discussed in this report 
our business strategy may not prove successful and we may not successfully address these risks 
we cannot be certain that we will sustain or increase profitability in order to be profitable  we must increase our revenues 
we may not be able to increase or even maintain our revenues and we may not achieve sufficient revenues or profitability in any future period 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year excluding acquisition related costs  we had an operating profit in fiscal year as a result of acquisition related costs  we will experience net losses for fiscal year we expect that our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year will be lower than our revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  net income and net income excluding acquisition related costs will decline in the first quarter of fiscal year in addition  we expect to increase our sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues from sales of our products to achieve and maintain profitability 
we expect that we will face increased competition that may make it more difficult to increase our revenues 
even if we are able to increase revenues  we may experience price competition which would lower our gross margins and our profitability 
another factor that will lower our gross margins is any increase in the percentage of our revenues that is derived from indirect channels and from services  both of which have lower margins 
we cannot be certain that we can sustain or increase operating and net profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our revenues will be adversely affected as a result of economic conditions and stock market valuations affecting our target markets we primarily market our products and services to providers of next generation communication services 
the substantial decline in the market value of dot com companies in the second half of has made it more difficult for emerging communication companies to obtain financing for their operations 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
emerging growth and established communications companies recently have been reducing or defering their purchases of software and related products  and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
this trend in technology and software spending will seriously harm our business until conditions improve 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments would result in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
any economic downturn or recession affecting our customers  whether as part of a general economic trend or a trend affecting a specific industry  will increase the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable or the time required to collect them 
failure to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner could result in increased write offs  higher reserves and lower cash reserves that would adversely affect our financial results and available cash resources 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of one or more public market analysts and investors and the price of our common stock may fall 
failure by technology companies to meet or exceed analyst expectations or any resulting changes in analyst recommendations or ratings frequently results in substantial decreases in the market value of the stock of such companies 
for example  our stock decreased significantly after the release of our financial results for the quarter ended october  factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include 
variations in demand for our products and services  including decreases caused by reductions in technology spending within our target markets  
the timing and execution of individual contracts  particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter  
the timing of sales of our products and services  
our ability to develop and attain market acceptance of enhancements to infranet and new products and services  
delays in introducing new products and services  
new product introductions by competitors  
changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  
announcements of new versions of products that cause customers to postpone purchases of portal s current products  
the mix of products and services sold  
the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  
the mix of domestic and international sales  
costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  
the timing of releases of new versions of third party software and hardware products that work with our products  
our ability to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate a substantial number of sales and marketing  research and development  technical support and other management personnel  
our ability to expand our operations  
the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations  and 
global economic conditions generally  as well as those specific to isps and other providers of communications and internet based services 
we have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders 
for example  substantially all of our future revenues will come from licenses of infranet and related services  and the market for this product is in its early stages of development and is therefore unpredictable 
in any given quarter  our sales have involved  and we expect will continue to involve  large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of infranet would reduce our revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
accordingly  delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
significant sales may also occur earlier than expected  which could cause operating results for later quarters to compare unfavorably with operating results from earlier quarters 
we record as deferred revenue fees from contracts that do not meet our revenue recognition policy requirements 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
new contracts that we enter into may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract was signed and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
we plan to increase our operating expenses in the future to expand our sales and marketing operations  broaden our customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels and fund greater levels of research and development 
we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  a delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods due to seasonal variations and we may fail to meet expectations we may also experience seasonality in our business 
in many software companies  the rate of growth of license fees revenues tends to decline from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next year  due in part to the structure of sales compensation plans 
we currently expect that our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year will be lower than the preceding quarter 
if we experience such seasonality in the future  our rate of growth or absolute revenues could decline in the first quarter of a fiscal year compared to the preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  the european operations of many companies experience some flatness in the summer months 
portal may also experience such a pattern in its european operations 
for example  the rate of growth in our european operations in the second quarter of fiscal year was significantly lower than the rate of growth in our other regions 
such seasonality may cause our results of operations to fluctuate or become more difficult to predict and could cause us to fail to meet internal or analyst expected financial results 
it is difficult to predict the timing of individual orders because infranet has a long and variable sales cycle to date  the sales cycle for infranet generally has been three to nine months or more 
the long sales and implementation cycles for infranet may cause license revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
along with systems integrators and our other distribution partners  we spend significant time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of infranet 
even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy infranet slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy infranet 
our business depends on the commercial acceptance of infranet and it is uncertain to what extent the market will accept this product our future growth depends on the commercial success of infranet 
substantially all of our licensing revenues are derived from infranet 
our business will be harmed if our target customers do not adopt and purchase infranet 
prospective customers may base their purchasing decisions based on a vendor s ability to support their cm b needs for both their new services and their other existing service offerings  such as fixed wire or mobile voice telephony or cable television 
for example  in the wireless communication area  many providers are currently conducting or planning trials to select the cm b and other technologies to be used in their next generation wireless communication networks that will support both voice and data communications 
our ability to address these current and future service requirements with our current version of infranet and planned future enhancements may affect the market acceptance of infranet by prospective customers who desire an integrated cm b solution for their different services 
our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of infranet 
we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and deploy infranet as their cm b solution 
in the future we may not be successful in marketing infranet or any new or enhanced products or services 
our future revenues will also depend on our customers licensing software for additional applicants or for additional subscribers 
their failure to do so could harm our business 
significant technical challenges arise in our business because many of our customers purchase and implement infranet in phases  deploy infranet across a variety of computer hardware platforms and integrate it with a number of legacy systems  third party software applications and programming tools 
implementation currently involves participation by our professional services group  which has limited resources 
some customers may also require us to develop costly customized features or capabilities  which increase our costs and consume our limited customer service and support resources 
also  revenues we derive from our services business have a significantly lower margin than revenues derived from licensing infranet 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services support  our operating margins could be harmed 
inability to sublease surplus office space would increase operating expenses and adversely effect operating results we must periodically change our office facilities in various locations as the number of existing and projected employees changes for those locations or as existing leases expire 
securing and building out facilities takes significant lead time 
furthermore  because of the need to satisfy projected future expansion  the amount of space leased is generally more than the amount currently required 
significant office leases have terms of between and years 
as a result  we frequently sublease the portions of leased facilities that we have leased to meet our future expansion plans but do not currently need 
for example  we have leased under long term leases significant amounts of space in for our regional headquarters facilities in herndon  virginia and slough  united kingdom in excess of our current requirements 
to the extent that we are unable to sublease surplus space at an amount equal to our rent obligations for that space or to the extent sublessees fail to perform their obligations to pay rent  we could incur greater operating expenses than we initially planned 
such increases in operating expenses in a period could cause us to exceed our planned expense levels and adversely affect our financial results for that period 
we must hire and retain qualified sales personnel to sell infranet our financial success and our ability to increase revenues in the future depend considerably upon productivity of our direct sales force that has historically generated a majority of portal s license revenues 
this productivity will depend to a large degree on our success in recruiting  training and retaining additional direct salespeople 
there is a shortage of direct sales personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to sell our products 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified sales personnel  or if newly hired salespeople fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
in addition  because we currently rely on indirect sales for a significant portion of our market opportunities  we may miss sales opportunities that are available through other sales distribution methods and other sources of leads  such as domestic and foreign resellers 
in the future  we intend to augment our indirect sales distribution methods through additional third party distribution arrangements 
however  there is no guarantee that we will successfully augment these arrangements or that the expansion of indirect sales distribution methods will increase revenues 
we may be at a serious competitive disadvantage if we fail to enhance these indirect sales channels 
we also use systems integrators and other strategic relationships to implement and sell infranet we have entered into relationships with third party systems integrators  as well as with hardware platform and software applications developers and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from customers that have significant relationships with our market and platform partners 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or fail to grow our base of market and platform partners 
many of these partners also work with competing software companies and our success will depend on their willingness and ability to devote sufficient resources and efforts to marketing our products versus the products of others 
we may not be able to enter into additional  or maintain our existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements with these parties typically are in the form of nonexclusive referral fee or reseller agreements that may be terminated by either party without cause or penalty and with limited notice 
therefore  there is no guarantee that any single party will continue to market our products 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales and marketing  implementation and support of infranet than we would otherwise  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of our partners  either of which would harm our business 
our quarterly revenue is generated from a limited number of customers and our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer a substantial portion of our license and services revenues in any given quarter has been  and is expected to continue to be  generated from a limited number of customers with large financial commitments 
for example  two customers accounted for a total of of total revenues for the quarter ended october   one customer accounted for of total revenue during the year ended january  and one customer accounted for of total revenue during the quarter ended january  as a result  if a large contract is cancelled or deferred or an anticipated contract does not materialize  our business would be harmed 
the communication industries we have targeted are consolidating  which could reduce the number of potential customers available to us 
in addition  several large telecommunications companies have announced decreases in their anticipated capital spending  which could have the effect of reducing future orders of our products 
unpredictable foreign payroll taxes may cause operating results to fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations we are generally subject to employer payroll taxes when our employees exercise their stock options 
the employer payroll taxes are assessed on each employee s gain  which is the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price 
during a particular period  these payroll taxes could be material 
these employer payroll taxes are recorded as an expense and are assessed at tax rates that vary depending upon the employee s taxing jurisdiction in the period such options are exercised based on actual gains realized by employees 
however  because we are unable to predict how many stock options will be exercised  at what price and in which country during any particular period  we cannot predict  the amount  if any  of employer payroll expense that will be recorded in a future period or the impact on our future financial results 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to successfully plan and manage changes in the size of our operations our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we plan to increase the scope of our operations domestically and internationally and have in recent years grown our headcount substantially 
on april   we had  employees  compared to a total of employees on january  this growth has placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources and on our internal training capabilities 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our work force worldwide 
we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations  and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 
our significant international operations and our planned expansion of our international operations make us much more susceptible to risks from international operations for the year ended january  and the year ended january   we derived approximately and of our revenue  respectively  from sales outside north america 
as a result  we face risks from doing business on an international basis  including  among others 
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
longer sales and payment cycles  
greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  
political and economic instability  
seasonal reductions in business activity  
potentially adverse tax consequences  
compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  and 
variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 
we currently have offices in a number of foreign locations including australia  canada  china  france  germany  hong kong  italy  japan  malaysia  mexico  singapore  spain  south korea  sweden  taiwan  poland and the united kingdom and plan to establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
in addition  we have sold infranet internationally for only a few years and we have limited experience in developing localized versions of infranet and marketing and distributing them internationally 
further  nearly all of our international revenues are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  a strengthening of the dollar versus other currencies could make our products less competitive in foreign markets or collection of receivables more difficult 
because our foreign denominated revenues have been minimal  we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage expansion of our business into international markets due to any of the foregoing factors  our business could be adversely affected 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of infringement our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology or to develop products with the same functionality as our products 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
moreover  as the number of competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  we expect that our software products may in the future become subject to third party infringement claims 
some of our competitors in the market for cm b software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology upon which they may claim our technology infringes 
any litigation  brought by us or by others  could be time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and could have a material and adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if a successful claim of product infringement were made against us  our business could be significantly harmed 
our business will suffer if our software contains significant errors or our product development is delayed we face possible claims and higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of infranet  undetected errors are of particular concern 
complex software  such as ours  always contains undetected errors 
the implementation of infranet  which we accomplish through our services division and with our partners  typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with an implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project and to provide these services at reduced or no cost 
if our software contains significant undetected errors or we fail to meet our customers expectations or project milestones in a timely manner we could experience 
loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  
loss of customers  
failure to achieve market acceptance  
diversion of development and implementation resources  
injury to our reputation  
increased service and warranty costs  
legal actions by customers against us  and 
increased insurance costs 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages 
however  these contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable  in certain jurisdictions and under certain circumstances  particularly if the damages relate to a year problem  and we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs  damaging our reputation and distracting our management 
despite investigation and testing by us and our partners  infranet and the underlying systems and protocols running it may contain previously undetected errors or defects associated with year or other date functions 
several customers  despite warnings regarding the use of non year certified versions of infranet  have continued to use non certified versions  and decline to upgrade to certified versions or implement maintenance fixes or bug releases made available to them 
portal integrates certain third party software into infranet 
these third party vendors may detect errors in their products after previously indicating that their products are year compliant 
such revelations by our partners have occurred in the past and may occur in the future  and these revelations have and could cause us to make changes in our products in response 
in the past we have failed to release certain new products and upgrades on time these delays may result in 
customer dissatisfaction  
cancellation of orders and license agreements  
negative publicity  
loss of revenues  
slower market acceptance  or 
legal action by customers against us 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to develop  license or acquire new products or enhancements to infranet on a timely and cost effective basis  or if these products or enhancements are not accepted by the market 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into infranet and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our business in the short term portions of infranet incorporate software developed and maintained by third party software vendors  such as operating systems  tools and database vendors 
we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors and developers to a larger degree in our future products 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products or future products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of  or any significant delay in  the replacement of that functionality could result in delayed or lost sales and increased costs and could harm our business in the short term 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage technological change the market for portal s products and the services they are used to support is characterized by 
rapid technological change  
frequent new product introductions  
changes in customer requirements  and 
evolving industry standards 
future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
infranet is designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  infranet may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments  accounting and other systems that our customers use 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to back office applications and other systems 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications  which may harm our business 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete  which would harm our business 
the markets in which we sell our product are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively we compete in markets that are new  intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we face competition from providers of cm b software  such as amdocs which has acquired solect technology  the kenan systems division of lucent  convergys which has recently acquired geneva  digiquant  daleen technologies  inc we also compete with systems integrators and with internal mis departments of larger telecommunications carriers 
we are aware of numerous other major isps  software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with infranet 
we anticipate continued growth and competition in the on line services and telecommunications industries and the entrance of new competitors into the cm b software market  and that the market for our products and services will remain intensely competitive 
we expect that competition will increase in the near term and that our primary long term competitors may have not yet entered the market 
many of our current and future competitors have significantly more personnel and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
also  current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can use to compete more effectively 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of internet based services  wireless services and other emerging services we sell infranet to organizations providing internet based  wireless and other emerging communications and e services 
consequently  our future revenues and profits  if any  substantially depend upon the market acceptance and expanded use of services provided through the and other communication methods 
rapid growth in the use of these services is a recent phenomenon and it may not continue 
as a result  a broad base of regular users of such services may not develop  and the market may not accept recently introduced services and products that rely upon the adoption of such services  such as infranet 
many of the companies that are marketing broadband access to the internet or are offering new services over the internet  wireless networks and other communication mediums are relatively new businesses 
in the past year  many so called dot 
com companies have failed and financing for emerging internet businesses appears to be increasingly more difficult for internet companies to obtain 
we believe that the decline in the rate of growth experienced in our north american operations in the third quarter of fiscal year is attributable in part to the difficulty experienced by several potential customers in receiving financing and a consequential impact on their decisions to make investments in cm b products and services 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
emerging growth and established communications companies recently have been reducing or deferring their purchases of software and related products  and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
this trend in technology and software spending will seriously harm our business until conditions improve 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments would result in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
to the extent that our customers and potential fail to achieve sustained profitability or obtain adequate funding  we could experience greater risk and difficulty collecting receivables from those customers that do purchase our products and services which would in turn harm our business and financial results 
future regulation of the internet may slow its growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that state and federal regulators could adopt laws and regulations that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business on line 
the growth and development of the market for internet based services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or for imposition of additional taxes 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the expansion of the internet or impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business on line 
a decline in the growth of the internet could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  sales tax  libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve 
our costs could increase and our growth could be harmed by any new legislation or regulation  the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business  or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other on line services 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain additional personnel we intend to hire a significant number of additional sales  support  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel in fiscal year and beyond 
competition for these individuals is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
our business cannot succeed if we cannot attract qualified personnel 
we currently have a small customer service and support organization and will need to increase our staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
hiring qualified customer service and support personnel  as well as sales  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel  is very competitive in our industry  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where portal is headquartered  due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the internet and other communication networks and services 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel in general and on the services of john e 
little  our president and chief executive officer and david s 
labuda  our chief technology officer  in particular 
none of our officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term 
we may experience difficulty integrating solution portal acquired the business of solution in november we may experience problems integrating the business of solution into our business 
any integration problems could cause us to incur substantial unanticipated costs and expenses  which would harm our operating results 
if we fail to integrate solution s business successfully  we will incur substantial costs  which will increase our expenses and reduce any earnings or potentially result in operating losses 
in addition  integration problems could divert management s attention from other business opportunities  which could result in slower revenue growth than anticipated or even declines in revenue 
integrating solution s business with our business will be complex  time consuming and expensive  particularly due to the geographic distance between solution s operations in germany and our headquarters in california 
this integration may disrupt our business if it is not completed in a timely  efficient and effective manner 
we have never attempted to integrate an acquisition of this size and we may not be successful in doing so 
specific integration challenges we will face include the following 
retaining existing customers  employees and strategic partners of solution  
retaining and integrating management and other key employees of solution  
combining product offerings and product lines effectively and quickly  including technical integration by our engineering team  
integrating sales efforts so that customers can easily do business with the combined company  
transitioning multiple information technology systems to a single system  
successfully developing and promoting a brand strategy and marketing it to existing and prospective customers  and 
developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
acquisitions of additional companies or technologies may result in further disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel and operations we may make additional acquisitions or investments in other companies  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
our reported financial results will suffer as a result of purchase accounting treatment of the solution acquisition and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets purchase accounting treatment of the acquisition of solution resulted in a large initial write off and will result in additional amortization over the next several years  which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and the market price of our common stock 
under purchase accounting  we have recorded the following as an asset on our balance sheet 
the fair value of the consideration given for solution s outstanding common stock  and 
acquisition related direct transaction costs  including the fees of our legal  accounting and financial advisors 
we have allocated these costs to individual solution assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these assets and liabilities included various identifiable intangible assets such as purchased developed technology 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are being amortized over a period corresponding to the life of the relevant asset 
in addition  we have allocated a portion of the purchase price for acquiring solution to in process research and development which was expensed in the fiscal quarter ending january  financial difficulties of companies we have invested in could adversely affect our financial results we have made investments in three companies and may make investments in others in the future 
if at any time our investment in a company were deemed impaired  we may be required to reduce the book value of that investment  which in turn reduce our earnings in that period 
such investments could be deemed impaired  for example  if the financial condition of those companies deteriorates 
as of april   we had approximately million invested in other companies 
because the financial condition of these companies is outside our control  we can not predict if  or when  the value of such investments would be required to be reduced 
the price of our common stock has been and will be volatile the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will fluctuate in the future 
for example in fiscal the price of our common stock fluctuated between and per share 
this future fluctuation could be a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
some of these factors include 
quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  
failure to meet the expectations of industry analysts  
changes in earnings estimates by portal or by analysts  
announcements and technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  
increased price competition  
developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights  and 
general conditions in the communications and internet industries 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies  including ours  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies or our company 
decreases in the trading prices of stocks of technology companies are often precipitous 
for example  the price of portal s stock dropped rapidly and significantly during the first quarter of fiscal year and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year after the announcement of financial results for the preceding third quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about portal s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with portal s business and future operating results 
short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments rated the equivalent of standard poor s and moody s short term rating a p or long term rating of at least a a this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity for portals investment portfolios as of january  this table does not include cash because cash is not subject to market risk 
it also does not include long term investments as they are held to maturity and  therefore  near term changes in market rates will not result in losses 
in thousands  except interest rates maturing maturing within within year years thereafter total as of january  cash equivalents   weighted average yield investments    weighted average yield total portfolio    weighted average yield impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal year  most local currencies of our international subsidiaries weakened against the us dollar 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
portal believes that its exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk has been insignificant primarily due to the denomination of nearly all of our sales transactions in us dollars 
for the fiscal year ended january   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
because our foreign denominated revenues have been minimal  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities as of january  as a global concern  portal anticipates that its sales outside the united states will increasingly be denominated in other currencies 
in such event  portal will face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on portal s financial position and results of operations 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  portal may hedge its exposure on certain transactional balances that are denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the success of such activity will depend upon the estimation of future transactions denominated in various currencies 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  portal could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses
