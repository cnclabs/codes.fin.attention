meridian sees several positive trends in its sales levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal that are expected to carry into fiscal the first positive trend is that meaningful progress continues to occur in restructuring meridian s cincinnati manufacturing operations and in improving quality systems  resulting in higher levels of available products 
this contributed to stronger sales in september compared to other months during the quarter 
meridian has seen this momentum carry into october 
through november   meridian is on track to meet its first quarter fiscal sales plan of  net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal also include the effects of a write off of inventory that was determined to be non saleable due to increased quality standards implemented over the last eight months  resulting in a gross profit margin of for the quarter

operating results for fiscal also include the impact of the acquisition of viral antigens  which became effective september  viral antigens contributed net sales of  for fiscal european restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a plan was implemented to restructure european distribution operations and improve operating results 
effective october   the european export business was transferred from germany to belgium 
during the second quarter of fiscal  meridian completed the transfer of the german business to an independent distributor 
total costs for the european restructuring plan have been  after tax  including  recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring costs included severance  future lease costs and asset writedowns for accounts receivable  fixed assets and certain intangible assets 
the european restructuring plan is complete and meridian does not expect to incur additional restructuring costs 
meridian believes that the results of the restructuring plan to date have been successful 
excluding restructuring costs  the european business segment generated operating income of  during fiscal compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal substantial savings have been realized from the closure of the german distribution facility 
fda matters during january  the fda completed a follow up inspection of meridian s compliance with the quality systems regulations that govern the manufacturing of in vitro diagnostics 
this inspection included a review of  among other things  procedures for validation  document control  corrective actions and design control 
in june  meridian received a warning letter from the fda which summarized and reiterated certain of the observations made by the fda during their follow up inspection completed in january meridian responded to the warning letter on july  in january  meridian submitted a comprehensive plan to the fda outlining specific steps it committed to undertake to improve its quality systems 
to concentrate and focus resources on qsr compliance  meridian discontinued the manufacture and distribution of approximately products 
the costs to date of implementing the plan include costs for outside consultants with experience in the quality system regulations  validation and computer software and equipment 
during the fourth quarter  meridian incurred plan implementation costs in the amount of  primarily related to consulting fees 
such costs were  for the year ended september  on an on going basis  meridian has considered the effects of incremental costs of compliance with qsr in its cost structure 
meridian believes that such incremental costs of compliance with qsr will be offset by cost reductions and efficiencies related to the restructuring of cincinnati manufacturing operations discussed below  and consequently  gross profit margins for the diagnostics business are expected to approach levels 
meridian continues to engage in other activities designed to reduce costs  improve operations and replace products that were discontinued 
meridian restructured its cincinnati manufacturing operations and quality functions by  among other things  hiring a number of professionals with experience in monitoring and improving a fda compliant quality system 
during the second quarter  meridian entered into a three year supply agreement with renewal options with zeus scientific  inc  whereby zeus will manufacture  on an oem basis  replacement products for of the discontinued meridian products 
as a result of the decision to discontinue the manufacturing and distribution of approximately products  meridian could not recover the cost of certain assets  and consequently  recorded the following pre tax charges during fiscal in thousands product inventory write off product recall costs write off of sales type lease receivables impaired instrumentation equipment impaired intangible assets impaired intangible assets include portions of manufacturing technologies  core products  customer lists and goodwill related to these products 
impairment amounts for long lived assets were measured by comparing discounted future cash flow projections to the net book value of the assets 
in accordance with the fda s directive in the warning letter  meridian engaged an outside independent auditor to evaluate meridian s progress in implementing its corrective plan 
based on an extensive review of documents and an on site visit  the auditors substantiated meridian s progress in addressing the issues raised in the fda inspection and warning letter 
contingent upon the successful restructuring of operations and the acceptance of the plan by the fda  meridian expects cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund working capital needs  debt service  dividends and the stock buyback program referred to in note to the consolidated financial statements during fiscal meridian is communicating with the fda on a periodic basis to advise it on the progress of the plan implementation 
at present  it is uncertain whether meridian s actions will be sufficient so that no further remedial action or enforcement action by the fda will occur 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net sales net sales decreased  or  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily comprised of currency losses  or and volume declines in the traditional meridian core business  that have been largely offset by volume increases from the viral antigens acquisition 
volume declines occurring in the traditional meridian core business were caused by discontinuing the manufacturing and distribution of approximately products and cincinnati manufacturing output inefficiencies
