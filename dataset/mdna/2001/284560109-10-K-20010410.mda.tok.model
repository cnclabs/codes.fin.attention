item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a self managed and self administered real estate investment trust that invests principally in senior housing and other healthcare facilities  including skilled nursing facilities  assisted and independent living facilities and medical office and other buildings 
the company conducts primarily all of its operations through the operating partnership  of which eldertrust is the sole general partner 
the company s consolidated assets consist primarily of the assets of the operating partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries 
as of december   skilled nursing  assisted and independent living facilities comprised approximately of the company s consolidated investments in real estate properties and loans 
approximately of the company s consolidated assets at december  consisted of real estate properties leased to or managed by and loans on real estate properties made to genesis or genesis equity investees 
revenues recorded by the company in connection with these leases and borrowings aggregated million in in addition  the company s equity investees have also leased properties to genesis or genesis equity investees 
as a result of these relationships  the company s revenues and ability to meet its obligations depends  in significant part  upon o the ability of genesis and genesis equity investees to meet their lease and loan obligations  and o the revenues derived from  and the successful operation of  the facilities leased to or managed by genesis or genesis equity investees 
genesis and multicare chapter bankruptcy filings  lease and loan restructuring on june   genesis and multicare filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code 
during the year  the company  genesis and multicare and genesis and multicare s major creditors negotiated agreements to restructure their debt and lease obligations with the company 
the agreements were approved by the us bankruptcy court on january  and were consummated on january  under the more significant terms of the agreement with genesis twenty one of the existing twenty three lease agreements between genesis subsidiaries and eldertrust continued in effect in accordance with their terms  except as provided below o two leases were modified to reduce combined rents for the properties by  per year  o one lease was modified to create an early termination right commencing on december   and o one lease was modified to permit eldertrust to terminate the lease during without penalty if the current tenant is unable to achieve occupancy targets specified by loan documents secured by property 
two leases windsor office building and windsor clinic training facility were terminated when the two properties subject to the leases were sold to genesis for million  such amount being paid via an increase in the notes receivable described in below  an million loan previously guaranteed by eldertrust and owed to genesis by et sub meridian  an unconsolidated subsidiary of eldertrust  was conveyed to eldertrust in a manner to effect an million reduction in amounts owed to eldertrust by genesis  the maturity date for three loans oaks  coquina and mifflin by eldertrust to genesis and affiliated entities with unpaid principal balances totaling approximately million at june  after taking into account the aforementioned million increase and million reduction were extended to june  at the rates in effect prior to the genesis bankruptcy filing  and the maturity date and interest rate for one loan harbor place with a principal balance of approximately million made by eldertrust to an entity in which genesis owns a limited partner interest was extended to may  at a interest rate  an increase of 
under the terms of the agreement with multicare  eldertrust acquired three properties secured by three loans lehigh  berkshire and sanatoga with outstanding principal amounts totaling approximately million  and having a net book value of million  at december   in exchange for the outstanding indebtedness 
these properties were then leased back to multicare under long term operating lease agreements 
eldertrust has no other transactions with this entity 
although the agreements with genesis and multicare have been approved by the us bankruptcy court and successfully consummated  there can be no assurance that either genesis or multicare will successfully emerge from bankruptcy 
as a result  there can be no assurance that genesis and multicare will continue to make loan and lease payments under the terms of the restructured loan and lease arrangements with those entities 
genesis and multicare are expected to file plans of reorganization with the us bankruptcy court addressing their other creditors claims 
both companies are currently operating as debtors in possession subject to the jurisdiction of the us bankruptcy court 
approval of the reorganization plans by the us bankruptcy court will be necessary for genesis and multicare to be able to emerge from bankruptcy 
the independent auditors report on genesis financial statements  included in genesis form k as of september   indicated that there is substantial doubt regarding the ability of genesis and multicare to continue as going concerns 
each company s ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon  among other things  approval of their respective plan of reorganization  future profitable operations  the ability to comply with the terms of their debtor in possession financing arrangements and the ability to generate sufficient cash from operations and financing agreements to meet their obligations 
although we are hopeful genesis and multicare will emerge from bankruptcy and continue to make lease and loan payments to us  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
any failure of genesis and multicare to continue their operations and or to continue to make lease and loan payments to us could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and cash flows due to the significant portion of our properties leased to and loans made to genesis and multicare 
if genesis and multicare were to cease making lease and loan payments to the company  we may be required to terminate the underlying leases and foreclose on the outstanding loans  in which event we would likely be required to find new operators to operate the properties underlying the leases and loans and or sell or close one or more properties 
management has contacted several alternative operators and  based on these preliminary discussions  believes that an adequate market currently exists in which the company could arrange for property management  leasing or sale of these assets  and that the properties could be successfully transitioned to new operators 
based on the discussions with these operators  the company s management believes that a property could be transitioned to a new operator without undue delay and that  due to the elderly resident population and care requirements this population requires  such transition would be completed in an orderly fashion and with the cooperation of the operators and the appropriate regulatory authorities  if any 
some of the operators contacted by the company have indicated that they have experience in transitioning skilled nursing facilities to new management and that they have the staffing needed to transition such facilities 
the company would expect to rely upon that experience to effect an orderly transition should genesis and or multicare fail to emerge from bankruptcy and or cease making lease or loan payments to us 
as a result of the relatively short estimated time period required to transition a property to a new operator  the company s management believes that  even if genesis or multicare were to cease making lease and loan payments to us either because genesis and multicare did not emerge from bankruptcy or otherwise  the company would still be able to satisfy its operating and debt service requirements during the next months 
management fee arrangements currently charged in the market place typically range from to of property gross revenues 
actual fees incurred would depend upon property type and location as well as other property and operator specific factors 
management estimates that  if all of the properties subject to leases and loans with genesis and multicare were returned to the company and were subjected to management agreements with new operators  the company s annual cash flows could be reduced by approximately million 
while difficult to predict  this estimate is based upon expected property operations and assumptions made by management as to management fees  capital expenditures and possible property closures 
the company has multiple debt agreements and is subject to debt covenants that  among other things  require minimum principal payments and contain various financial covenants 
although the company s management believes  based upon the above noted estimated cash flow reduction  that the company would be able to meet its operating and debt service obligations during the next months if it were required to obtain new managers for the properties now operated by genesis and multicare  a termination of leases and loans with genesis and multicare may impair the company s ability to meet one or more of the financial covenants contained in its debt agreements 
should this occur  the company s management believes that alternative arrangements could be reached with its various lenders to restructure its loan agreements  if necessary  so as to reflect any adverse change in economic condition 
this belief is based  in part  upon the company s past history in negotiating mutually acceptable agreements with these lenders 
depending on the magnitude of the reduction in the company s operating cash flow  the company would seek to offset the effect of such reduction in operating cash flow on the company s ability to meet its debt service requirements through asset sales or through other available means 
the company believes that it has the ability to  and  if necessary  intends to  take these actions available to it and  as a result  believes it will be able to continue to satisfy its debt and operating obligations as they come due during the next twelve months 
as indicated above  based upon management s assessment of the long term care economic environment  its discussions with alternative operators and the company s past history with its lenders  the company believes that  if the loans and leases with genesis and multicare were terminated  that the assets could be redeployed as needed 
were this to occur  management believes that new operators would be available to operate the properties  that any cash flow interruption resulting from such redeployment is unlikely or would be minimal and that  although cash flows may be reduced  the company would be able to meet its operating and debt service requirements under its existing debt agreements during the next months and negotiate amendments  if necessary  with respect to any failure to meet financial covenants in those debt instruments 
the company has incurred indebtedness to acquire its assets and may incur additional short and long term indebtedness  and related interest expense  from time to time

under the terms of the bank credit facility  the company cannot distribute to its shareholders more than of that amount required to maintain reit status

the terms of the credit facility extension reduced the company s cash flows and impose limits on its ability to make distributions to its shareholders

the company anticipates entering into similar leases with respect to additional properties acquired 
however  there can be no assurance the company will not be responsible for significant expenses of its leased properties in the event one or more of its lessees default on their leases with the company 
in august  the company implemented a share repurchase program 
under the share repurchase program  the company was authorized from time to time to repurchase shares in open market transactions up to an amount equal to the company s excess cash flow on a quarterly and cumulative basis 
in march  in light of the company s cash position and credit facility negotiations  the company suspended the share repurchase program 
in november  the company reinstated the share repurchase program on a limited basis 
the company completed this limited share repurchase program in december with the repurchase of  common shares at an average price of 
the company repurchased and effectively retired  and  common shares for an aggregate purchase price of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these shares are reflected as a reduction of shares issued and outstanding in the accompanying financial statements 
the company did not repurchase any common shares in funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in october defines funds from operations as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the company believes that funds from operations ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an indication of the ability of the company to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
the company computes funds from operations using standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term using the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities using generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
effective january   funds from operations includes both recurring and non recurring results of operations  except those results defined as extraordinary items under generally accepted accounting principles and gains and losses from sales of depreciable property

impact of inflation earnings of the company are primarily from long term investments with fixed interest rates and fixed and percentage rental streams

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investments in real estate loans receivable bear interest at fixed rates 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying fixed interest rate loans receivable  but not earnings or cash flows 
the carrying amount of real estate loans receivable at december  approximates the fair value of the underlying properties 
the company s bonds and most of the company s mortgages payable bear interest at fixed rates 
the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its credit facility and variable rate mortgages 
the company utilizes interest rate cap agreements to limit the impact that interest rate fluctuations have on its variable rate mortgages 
interest rate cap agreements are used for hedging purposes rather than for trading purposes 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or any other type of derivative financial instruments  other than interest rate cap agreements 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the underlying indebtedness  but not earnings or cash flows 
the company generally cannot prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
the maturity schedule for the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable is as follows in thousands thereafter  at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate mortgages and bonds payable approximates its carrying value of million 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
at december   the fair value of the company s variable rate debt approximates its carrying value of million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and variable rate mortgages was at december  assuming the credit facility and variable rate mortgage balances outstanding at december  of million remains constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates from at december  would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  based on the current interest rate terms 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at floating rates ranging from to over one month libor as determined by the percentage of the credit facility outstanding as compared to the borrowing base 
variable rate mortgages bear interest at over one month libor 
the company may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  therefore  would result in increases in interest expenses  which could adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay its obligations and make distributions to shareholders at current levels
