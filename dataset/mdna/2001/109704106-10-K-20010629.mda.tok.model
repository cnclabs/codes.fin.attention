in august  brio completed its merger with sqribe technologies corp 
sqribe  a delaware corporation 
brio acquired all of the outstanding shares of sqribe preferred and common stock in a tax free  stock for stock transaction for approximately million shares of brio common stock 
in addition  brio assumed all outstanding stock options and warrants of sqribe 
the acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated  in accordance with required pooling of interests accounting and disclosures 
brio s revenues consist of license fees for software products and fees for services  including software maintenance and support  training and system implementation consulting 
revenues in current periods are generally attributable to the sale of the most recent version of brio s products 
brio generally discontinues marketing older product versions when a new product version is introduced 
the products are typically licensed on a per user basis with the price per user varying based on the selection of products licensed or on a per computer server basis with the price varying based on the computing power of the server 
additionally  brio also sells larger enterprise wide implementations of their products through site licenses with the price per site varying based on the selection of 
products licensed  
the number of authorized users or computer servers for each product at each site  and 
the number of licensed sites 
revenues from license fees are recognized upon shipment of the software if 
collection of the resulting receivable is probable  
the fee is fixed or determinable  and 
vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
if payments are subject to extended payment terms and are not deemed fixed or determinable  brio defers revenue until payments become due 
if an acceptance period is required  brio recognizes revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
brio establishes allowances for potential product returns and credit losses  which have been insignificant to date 
brio charges fees for services separately from license fees 
brio recognizes revenues from maintenance and support services  including ongoing product support and periodic product updates  ratably over the term of each contract  which is typically twelve months 
payments for maintenance and support services are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
brio recognizes revenues from training and consulting services when the services are performed 
to date  brio has derived revenues from license fees principally from direct sales of software products to end users through brio s direct sales force 
although brio believes that such direct sales will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues from license fees in the foreseeable future  brio has recently developed  and intends to continue to develop  reselling relationships with vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors 
brio expects that revenues from sales through vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors will increase in the future as a percentage of revenues from license fees 
revenues from vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors were approximately of total revenues for fiscal  approximately of total revenues for fiscal and approximately of total revenues for fiscal brio s ability to achieve revenue growth and improved operating margins  as well as increased worldwide sales in the future  will depend in large part upon its success in expanding and maintaining relationships with vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors 
see risk factors that may affect future operating results for a description of the risks related to brio s sales strategy 
brio is also increasing its efforts to sell licenses to larger  enterprise wide implementations of brio s products  rather than departmental or local network sales  which may increase the complexity and length of the sales cycle 
brio has  in the past and may in the future  chosen to grant greater license discounts and discounts on other elements  such as training and consulting  for sales of site licenses 
see risk factors that may affect future operating results for a description of the risks related to the sales cycle of brio s products 
brio has  to date  sold its products internationally through direct sales offices in canada  brazil  the united kingdom  france  germany  belgium  japan  singapore  hong kong and australia  and indirectly through established distribution relationships in more than countries  including italy  the netherlands and south africa 
brio s direct sales offices in the united kingdom  china and australia were formed through the acquisition of distributors in those countries 
sales to customers outside of the united states and canada  including sales generated by brio s foreign subsidiaries  represented approximately of total revenues for fiscal and approximately of total revenues for fiscal and fiscal a substantial portion of brio s international sales in the past have been denominated and collected in foreign currencies and brio believes that a portion of its cost of revenues and operating expenses will continue to be incurred in foreign currencies 
to date  there have been no material effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues or operating expenses 
brio incurred a loss on foreign currency translations resulting from intercompany receivables from foreign subsidiaries in an amount of approximately  in fiscal  approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal although it is impossible to predict future exchange rate movements between the us dollar and other currencies  to the extent the us dollar strengthens or weakens against other currencies  a substantial portion of brio s revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses will be commensurately lower or higher than would be the case in a more stable foreign currency environment 
although brio has not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover its potential foreign currency exposure  it may do so in the future

brio anticipates that research and development expenditures will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although such expenses may vary as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  commissions  bonuses and sales incentives  travel  marketing programs such as trade shows and seminars and promotion costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal and million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increases were attributable to the costs associated with the expansion of brio s sales and marketing organization  including domestically through the growth of the telesales organization  internationally through the establishment of subsidiary offices in the united kingdom  france  germany  japan  singapore  hong kong and australia in addition to the expansion of the worldwide field sales organization which contributed approximately million of the increase in fiscal and approximately million of the increase in fiscal higher sales commissions  bonuses and sales incentives associated with increased total revenues also contributed approximately million of the increase in fiscal and approximately million of the increase in fiscal increased domestic and international marketing expenses  including marketing activities  personnel and related costs contributed approximately million of the increase in fiscal and approximately million of the increase in fiscal brio believes that as it continues to expand its direct sales and pre sales support organization and its third party partnering relationships and its indirect channel sales organization on a worldwide basis  sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars 
these expenses are currently intended to be funded by brio s working capital

in connection with the granting of  stock options to employees during fiscal  with a weighted average exercise price of per share and a weighted average deemed fair market value of per share  brio recorded deferred compensation of  representing the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant 
in addition  brio granted  stock options to employees during fiscal  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  with a weighted average deemed fair market value of per share and recorded the difference between the deemed fair market value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant as  of compensation expense and  of deferred compensation

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding deferred compensation 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of merlinsoft  inc merlinsoft in october  brio allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represented the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the project s completion percentage 
while brio relied upon an independent  third party appraisal of the acquired intangible assets  management was primarily responsible for estimating their fair values 
at the acquisition date  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility due to issues involving the completion of scalability  performance and security functions and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over identified intangible assets was approximately  brio used a third party appraiser to assess and value the in process research and development 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology in developing a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected sales of such a product  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate included a factor that took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology 
valuation of development efforts in the future was excluded from the research and development appraisal 
the purchased in process research and development consisted of two projects 
both of these projects are aimed at the delivery of timely  in depth  sophisticated analytical applications 
the first product provides data models for analysis in specific industries and functional areas  metric libraries  a web based client and the ability for business users to manage application components analysis product 
the second product includes in depth modeling features for margin analysis and what if scenarios to determine the impact of various decisions and parameters modeling product 
the research and development costs incurred by merlinsoft in the development of the analysis product were approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the research and development costs incurred by merlinsoft in the development of the modeling product were approximately  in fiscal at the date of acquisition  the research and development costs to complete the analysis product were estimated by merlinsoft to be approximately  in fiscal and at the date of acquisition  the research and development costs to complete the modeling product project were estimated by merlinsoft to be approximately  in each of the fiscal years ending and the development technologies were evaluated in the context of interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and sfas no 
 where appropriate 
in accordance with these provisions  research and development projects were evaluated individually to determine if technological feasibility had been achieved and if there was any alternative future use 
such evaluation consisted of a specific review of the efforts  including the overall objectives of the project  progress toward the objectives and uniqueness of developments to these objectives 
the issue of alternative future use was addressed in discussions with the management of brio 
this process included on site management interviews and review of technical data 
as of march   brio has successfully completed the analysis and modeling products 
merlinsoft s results have not differed significantly from the forecast assumptions 
brio s research and development expenditures since the acquisition have not differed materially from expectations 
revenue contribution from the acquired technology falls within an acceptable range of the forecast assumptions 
the risks associated with products are still considered high and no assurance can be made that the products will meet market expectations 
non recurring operating expenses 
non recurring operating expenses for fiscal are comprised of merger and restructuring costs related to the sqribe merger and the settlement of brio s ongoing patent litigation with business objects as follows in thousands march  merger and restructuring costs  settlement costs  total non recurring operating expenses  brio s merger with sqribe was completed on august  in fiscal  merger and restructuring costs of million consisted of million in transaction and related professional fees   in severance costs to terminate employees  million in merger integration expenses   in consolidation of facilities   in equipment retirements and  in other miscellaneous merger related expenses 
all termination notices and benefits were communicated to the affected employees prior to year end and all of the merger related expenses were incurred prior to year end 
substantially all of the merger related charges were paid during fiscal on september   brio and business objects announced the settlement of a patent infringement action  pending in the us district court for the northern district of california in san jose  pursuant to which brio agreed to pay to business objects million  payable quarterly in million payments over quarters  with the first payment due september  the million of settlement costs represent the net present value of the quarterly payments and the remaining  represents interest and will be recognized over the payment term using the effective interest rate method 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  is comprised primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses and realized gains or losses from the sale of investments  net of interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest charges relating to the business objects litigation settlement and interest incurred on brio s bank line of credit 
interest and other income expense  net  decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to interest charges relating to the business objects litigation settlement  lower cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and a higher loss on foreign currency translations resulting from intercompany receivables from foreign subsidiaries of approximately  in fiscal  approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of foreign currency transactions and brio s policy related to accounting for short term investments 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal year consisted primarily of current income taxes generated from international operations 
the provision for income taxes of  in fiscal and  in fiscal consisted primarily of federal and state alternative minimum taxes as brio utilized net operating loss carryforwards to offset current income taxes generated from domestic operations 
at march   brio has approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  of state net operating loss carryforwards both of which expire at various dates through brio also has approximately  of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  which expire at various dates through or carryforward indefinitely 
in addition  brio has federal r d tax credit carryforwards of approximately  state r d tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various dates through brio believes that  based on a number of factors  there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of carryforwards and credits and has therefore provided a valuation allowance for a significant portion of its deferred tax asset at march  these factors include a history of operating losses  recent increases in expense levels to support brio s growth  the competitive nature of brio s market and the lack of predictability of revenue 
management will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefits available to brio based on actual and forecasted operating results 
furthermore  the internal revenue code contains provisions which may limit the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including a significant change in ownership 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for brio s fiscal year beginning april  management believes the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on brio s financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   brio had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
in addition  brio maintains a bank line of credit 
the line provides for up to million in borrowings  with interest at the bank s prime rate 
borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit are limited to of eligible accounts receivable 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of brio s assets  including brio s intellectual property  accounts receivable and property and equipment to the extent required to secure the line 
as of march   the line of credit requires brio to comply with various covenants  including quarterly requirements to maintain a minimum quick ratio as well as achieve minimum profitability or not exceed a maximum quarterly loss 
brio was not in compliance with the profitability covenant as of march   however  a waiver was obtained from the bank 
the line expires on march  no amounts are outstanding under the line as of march  as part of the merger with sqribe  brio assumed a million bank line of credit 
during fiscal  all amounts outstanding under the line were paid and the line was cancelled 
brio also assumed a million equipment purchase line of credit under which a  letter of credit was outstanding to support a facilities lease 
in december the letter of credit was cancelled 
a new letter of credit in the amount of  was issued under the new brio bank line of credit in may net cash used by operating activities was  in fiscal net cash generated by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net cash used by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to million of unfavorable changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities  offset by a million decrease in net loss applicable to common stock 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in net loss applicable to common stock  offset by million of favorable changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to a million decrease in net loss applicable to common stock  offset by million of unfavorable changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities

brio currently has no material commitments other than those under operating lease agreements 
brio has experienced a substantial increase in its capital expenditures and operating lease arrangements since inception  which is consistent with increased staffing  and anticipates that this will continue in the future 
additionally  brio will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to those of brio  which transactions may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet brio s operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  brio may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance its position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to brio s stockholders 
risk factors that may affect future operating results we desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and of section b and rule b under the securities and exchange act of specifically  we wish to alert readers that the following important factors  as well as other factors including  without limitation  those described elsewhere in reports we have filed with the sec and incorporated into this annual report on form k by reference  could in the future affect  and in the past have affected  our actual results and could cause our results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements 
because our plans to achieve profitability in the future require us to grow our work force  improve our infrastructure and acquire and develop new technologies  failure to successfully do so could lower our operating results and cause our stock price to decrease 
if we cannot execute our growth strategy  our stock price could decrease 
successfully achieving our growth strategy depends upon the combined company s ability to 
expand  train and manage our work force  
continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and 
develop or acquire new businesses  products and technologies 
in addition  if we cannot manage an expanding work force  improve our reporting systems and customer service infrastructure and manage the integration of acquired businesses  products or technologies  we will be unable to continue to manage the growth of our operations  which could harm our business and financial results 
brio has a history of net losses  and may not be profitable in the future 
brio has a history of net losses  and cannot provide any assurance that we will experience revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in particular  brio incurred net losses applicable to common stock of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal as of march   brio had stockholders equity of approximately million 
brio anticipates increased operating expenses and a reduced rate of revenue growth in the future 
brio currently expects to increase its expenses  and our operating results will be harmed if increased revenues do not accompany these increased expenses 
brio may not sustain the same rate of sequential quarterly revenue growth it has experienced in the past in future periods 
in addition  brio will likely increase its operating expenses significantly in fiscal brio currently intends to commit substantial financial resources to research and development  customer support and sales and marketing  including the continued expansion of its domestic and international direct sales force  third party partnering relationships and brio s domestic and international indirect channel sales organization 
brio also expects to increase staffing and systems infrastructure in order to support expanding operations 
our prospects for increased future revenues must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in a similar stage of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
to address these risks  the company must 
successfully increase the scope of its operations  
respond to competitive developments  
continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and 
continue to commercialize products incorporating advanced technologies 
brio may not be able to achieve these goals 
brio s quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate based on factors beyond our control 
brio has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results based on a number of factors  many of which are not within its control 
among other things  brio s operating results have fluctuated in the past due to 
the timing of product enhancements and new product announcements  
the lengthy sales cycle of its products  
market acceptance of and demand for its products  
capital spending patterns of its customers  
customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  
its ability to attract and retain key personnel  
the mix of domestic and international sales  
the mix of license and service revenues  
personnel changes  and 
changes in the timing and level of operating expenses 
during fiscal  brio found that several of these factors negatively impacted its profitability 
in particular  brio found that deals for large scale deployments of its products  which have become more prevalent  have a longer sales cycle than smaller implementations 
in addition  the mix of license and service revenues varied significantly when compared to historical results 
in addition  the announcement or introduction of new products by brio or its competitors or any change in industry standards may cause customers to defer or cancel purchases of existing products 
furthermore  the introduction of products with reliability  quality or compatibility problems could result in reduced orders  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional service costs 
accordingly  brio s results of operations may also fluctuate in the future due to a number of additional factors  including but not limited to those discussed above  as well as 
the number and significance of product enhancements and new product announcements by competitors  
changes in pricing policies by brio and its competitors  
brio s ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of its products on a timely basis  
customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products offered by competitors  
nonrenewal of service agreements  software defects and other product quality problems  
the mix of direct and indirect sales  
currency fluctuations  and 
general economic conditions 
due to these factors  quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to forecast and may not meet expectations 
seasonality may affect brio s results 
brio has experienced seasonality due to customer capital spending patterns and the general summer slowdown in sales 
brio expects to continue to experience seasonality as a result of these factors 
this seasonality could materially hurt results of operations  particularly for the quarters ending june or september if brio s operating results do not meeting financial analysts expectations  our stock price may decline 
in the future  our reported or anticipated operating results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  brio s common stock price could be materially reduced 
because brio depends on a direct sales force  any failure by brio to attract and retain adequate sales personnel could slow its sales and increase its expenses  causing significant financial and operational risks 
brio may not be able to attract and retain adequate sales personnel  despite the expenditure of significant resources to do so  and the failure to do so could materially harm its ability to sell its products at expected levels 
because turnover tends to slow sales efforts until replacement personnel can be recruited and trained  failure to retain sales personnel could seriously hamper our business  operating results and financial condition 
competition for personnel with a sufficient level of expertise and experience for direct sales positions is intense  particularly among competitors who may have substantially greater resources than brio or greater resources dedicated to hiring direct sales personnel 
in addition  brio has experienced significant turnover of its sales force 
brio s success depends on key personnel who may not continue to work for it 
the loss of the services of any of the key personnel or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future could harm brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
the success of brio will depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to retain or replace if they leave brio 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  brio may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it seeks 
brio has recently experienced difficulties in hiring highly qualified sales  engineering and it personnel  and may continue to have difficulty in attracting employees in those categories 
brio has employment contracts with six members of its executive management personnel 
brio does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its executive management 
our management team has limited prior experience together 
brio hired a new president and chief executive officer in january and has thereafter hired other key members of executive management 
because our management team has limited experience working together  they may not effectively manage our operations 
management ineffectiveness may disrupt our entire business operation  distract our employees and impair our ability to execute our strategy 
because the sales cycle for brio s products is long  the timing of sales is difficult to predict and brio s quarterly revenues and earnings may fluctuate significantly 
based in part on the lengthy sales cycle for brio s products  quarterly revenues and operating results could vary significantly in the future 
the sales cycle associated with the purchase of brio s products is typically three to nine months in length and subject to a number of significant risks over which brio has little or no control  including customers budgeting constraints and internal acceptance review procedures 
in particular  large scale deployments of brio s products  which are becoming more prevalent in the industry  take longer to evaluate  implement and close than historical sales cycles seem to indicate 
sales transactions may be delayed during the customer acceptance process because brio must provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of its products 
additionally  the sales cycle for brio s products in international markets has historically been  and is expected to continue to be  longer than the sales cycle in the united states and canada 
accordingly  if brio s international operations expand  the average sales cycle for its products is expected to lengthen 
in addition  brio anticipates that an increasing portion of its revenue could be derived from larger orders  in which case the timing of receipt and fulfillment of those orders could cause material fluctuations in operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
because brio expects to achieve revenue growth and increased margins through indirect sales channels  brio s failure to develop and manage indirect sales channels could limit its sales growth and financial performance 
brio may not be able to continue to attract and retain additional indirect channel partners that will be able to market its products effectively and provide timely and cost effective customer support and services 
brio may not be able to manage conflicts within its indirect channel or that its focus on increasing sales through the indirect channels will not divert management resources and attention from direct sales 
in addition  brio s agreements with indirect channel partners do not restrict the channel partners from distributing competing products  and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause 
the ability of brio to achieve revenue growth and improved operating margins on product sales in the future will depend in large part upon its success in expanding and maintaining indirect channels worldwide 
indirect channels include vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors 
to date  brio has generated a majority of its sales from its direct sales force  and has supplemented its direct sales efforts with the efforts of vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors in a variety of locations throughout the world 
these third parties perform some or all of the following functions sales and marketing  systems implementation and integration  software development and customization  and ongoing consulting  training  service and technical support 
brio generally offers such parties discounts on products and training  as well as a cooperative marketing program and field level assistance from brio s direct and channel sales forces 
brio intends to leverage sales and marketing through indirect channel partners that will distribute or resell brio s products in their respective markets 
revenues from vars  plps  resellers  system integrators and distributors accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal  approximately of total revenues in fiscal and approximately of total revenues in fiscal brio s strategy of acquiring new businesses and technologies involves integration and transaction completion risks 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to enter into business combinations and acquisitions 
acquisition transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including 
the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  
the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  
the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology or content and rights into our products  
the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense which can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  
the failure to successfully develop an acquired in process technology could result in the impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets  
unanticipated expenses related to technology integration  
the maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  
the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel  and 
the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions 
brio is in a highly competitive industry and some of its competitors may be more successful in attracting and retaining customers 
the market in which brio operates is highly competitive 
brio expects that competition will continue to intensify 
increased competition could result in 
price reductions  
fewer customer orders  
reduced gross margins  
longer sales cycles  and 
loss of market share 
brio or its competitors may announce enhancements to existing products  or new products embodying new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements that have the potential to supplant or provide lower cost alternatives to brio s existing products 
current and potential competitors offer a variety of software solutions and generally fall within several categories 
business intelligence software vendors such as cognos  business objects  crystal decisions and hummingbird  
vendors offering alternative approaches to delivering reporting and analysis capabilities to users  such as microstrategy  computer associates  information advantage and actuate  
portal software vendors  such as plumtree  viador and portal software  
database vendors that offer client products that operate specifically with their proprietary database  such as microsoft  ibm  oracle and ardent  
analytic application vendors such as e 
piphany  and 
other companies that may in the future announce offerings similar to the brio business performance platform 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than brio to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sales of their products than brio 
brio expects additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter into the business intelligence software market and new products and technologies are introduced 
brio will compete on the basis of the following factors 
completeness of product offering  
product features  
ease of use  
product performance  
product quality  
analytical capabilities  
scalability  
open architecture  
customer support  
time to market  and 
price 
our failure to compete favorably in these areas could limit our ability to attract and retain customers  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
market consolidation may create more formidable competitors 
alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share 
the failure of brio to compete successfully against current and future competitors could materially harm its business  operating results and financial condition by driving down prices and reducing revenue growth 
current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of brio s prospective customers 
current or future indirect channel partners of brio may establish cooperative relationships with current or potential competitors  thereby limiting brio s ability to sell its products through particular distribution channels 
such competition could have a material adverse effect on brio s ability to obtain new licenses and maintenance and support renewals for existing licenses on favorable terms 
further  competitive pressures may require brio to reduce the price of its products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
brio s plans to expand internationally expose brio to risks related to managing international operations  currency exchange rates  tariffs and other difficulties related to foreign operations 
a key component of brio s strategy is its planned expansion into additional international markets 
if the international revenues generated by these expanded operations are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign operations  brio s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 
in addition to the uncertainty as to brio s ability to expand its international presence  there are risks inherent in doing business on an international level  including 
technical difficulties associated with product localization in foreign countries  
increased liability and financial exposure under foreign laws  
increased difficulty in controlling operating expenses  
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
longer payment cycles  
problems in collecting accounts receivable  
political instability  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe  and 
potentially adverse tax consequences 
each of these factors could adversely impact the success of brio s international operations and  consequently  could harm brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
in particular  brio s international sales are generally denominated and collected in foreign currencies  and brio has not historically undertaken foreign exchange hedging transactions to cover potential foreign currency exposure 
brio incurred a loss on foreign currency translations resulting from intercompany receivables from foreign subsidiaries in an amount of approximately  fiscal  approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal brio s future success will depend upon successful product development in the face of changing customer requirements and rapid technological change 
brio s failure to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis that meet changing customer requirements and technological changes could result in reduced demand for or market acceptance of brio s products  which could hurt brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
brio s products incorporate a number of advanced technologies  including proprietary data analysis engines  a distributed architecture  as well as web access and delivery technology 
brio may be required to change and improve its products in response to changes in operating systems  applications  networking and connectivity software  computer and communications hardware  programming tools and computer language technology 
brio may not successfully respond to changing technology  identify new product opportunities or develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
in the past brio has experienced delays in software development 
in particular  development efforts in the unix server environment are complex  and in the past brio has encountered delays in developing products for this environment 
brio may experience delays in connection with current or future product development activities 
because brio s future success will depend upon successful product development in the face of evolving industry standards  failure to introduce new products could hurt its growth and profitability 
brio s failure to introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis that are compatible with industry standards could delay or hinder demand for or market acceptance of its products  which could hurt brio s growth and profitability 
the market may not accept brio s products  which would reduce revenues  growth and profitability 
brio is focusing its selling efforts increasingly on larger  enterprise wide implementations of its products  and brio expects these sales to constitute an increasing portion of any of its future revenue growth 
failure of a significant market for analytic solutions to continue to grow  or failure of enterprise wide implementations of brio s products to achieve broad market acceptance  could materially harm brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
to date  brio s selling efforts have resulted in limited enterprise wide implementations of its products 
brio believes that most companies currently are not yet aware of the benefits of enterprise wide analytic solutions or of its products and capabilities  nor have most companies deployed analytic solutions on an enterprise wide basis 
brio s efforts to promote market awareness of its products and the problems its products address may not be sufficient to build market awareness of the need for analytic solutions or acceptance of brio s products 
product defects could adversely affect brio s operating results 
as a result of their complexity  brio s software products may contain undetected errors  failures or viruses 
brio or its customers may discover errors in new products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance or damage to brio s reputation  which could have a material adverse effect upon brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  brio s license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit brio s exposure for potential claims based on error or malfunctions of brio s products 
the limitation of liability provisions contained in brio s license agreements may not be effective under the laws of all jurisdictions 
brio s sale and support of its products entail the risk of warranty claims  and brio s insurance against product liability risks may not be adequate to cover a potential claim 
a product liability claim brought against brio could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
brio has one issued patent and twelve pending patent applications 
brio s intellectual property protection may not be adequate to prevent competitors from entering its markets or developing competing products 
brio s limited intellectual property protection may allow competitors to enter its market or develop competing products  resulting in competitive harm to brio 
the methods used by brio to protect its proprietary rights afford only limited protection 
brio currently relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights 
brio currently has one us patent and twelve pending applications 
the patent applications may not result in the issuance of a patent 
our issued patent and any additional patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  and the rights granted under these patents might not provide brio competitive advantages 
brio may not obtain any more patents 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to brio s technology or design around our patent or any other patent that we may come to own 
despite brio s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of brio s products or to obtain and use information that brio regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of brio s products is difficult  and while brio is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  brio expects software piracy to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the us brio s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the us or abroad may not be adequate  and competitors may independently develop similar technology 
investment risks brio s common stock has a limited trading history and a volatile price 
there has only been a public market for brio s common stock since april   and an active public market may not continue 
the market price of the shares of brio s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by a number of factors  including 
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  
announcement of business partnerships  
technological innovations or new product introductions by us or our competitors  
changes of estimates of our future operating results by securities analysts  
developments with respect to copyrights or proprietary rights  or 
general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies 
broad market fluctuations  as well as economic conditions generally and in the software industry specifically  may result in material adverse effects on the market price of brio s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
such litigation may occur in the future with respect to brio  and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon brio s business  operating results and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions may adversely effect brio s stock price and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire brio 
provisions of brio s charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of brio or its management  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of brio s common stock 
these include provisions 
relating to a classified board of directors and provisions eliminating cumulative voting  
eliminating the ability of stockholders to take actions by written consent  and 
limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice 
in addition  the brio board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of brio s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that brio may issue in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of brio s outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of brio 
brio has no present plan to issue shares of preferred stock
