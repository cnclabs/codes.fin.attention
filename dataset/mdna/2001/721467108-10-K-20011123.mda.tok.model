item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition forward looking statements statements of our intentions  beliefs  expectations or predictions for the future  denoted by the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  project  imply  intend  foresee and similar expressions  are forward looking statements that reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
such risks  uncertainties and assumptions include the following matters affecting the poultry industry generally  including fluctuations in the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  management of our cash resources  particularly in light of our substantial leverage  restrictions imposed by  and as a result of  our substantial leverage  currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation and other risks associated with foreign operations  changes in laws or regulations affecting our operations  as well as competitive factors and pricing pressures  inability to effectively integrate wlr foods or realize the associated cost savings and operating synergies currently anticipated  and the impact of uncertainties of litigation as well as other risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of these factors  among others  many of which are beyond our control 
general profitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients  chicken and turkey  which are determined by supply and demand factors 
as a result  the chicken and turkey industries are subject to cyclical earnings fluctuations 
cyclical earnings fluctuations can be mitigated somewhat by business strategy  product mix  sales and marketing plans  and operating efficiencies 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  we have concentrated on the production and marketing of prepared foods products 
prepared foods products generally have higher profit margins than our other products 
also  the production and sale in the us of prepared foods products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability 
feed ingredient purchases are the single largest component of our cost of goods sold  representing approximately of our consolidated cost of goods sold in fiscal the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
as further processing is performed  feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product s total production cost  thereby reducing their impact on our profitability 
products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium  reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins 
business segments since the acquisition of wlr foods on january   we operate in two reportable business segments as a producer of chicken and other products and a producer of turkey products 
our chicken and other products segment primarily includes sales of chicken products we produce and purchase for resale in the united states and mexico  but also includes the sale of table eggs  and feed 
our chicken and other products segment conducts separate operations in the united states and mexico and is reported as two separate geographical areas 
our turkey segment includes sales of turkey products produced in our turkey operation recently acquired from wlr foods  whose operations are exclusively in the united states 
inter area sales and inter segment sales  which are not material  are accounted for at prices comparable to normal trade customer sales 
corporate expenses are included with chicken and other products

consolidated net sales were billion for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in consolidated net sales resulted from a million increase in us chicken sales to billion  a million increase in turkey sales  a million increase in sales of other us products to million and by a million increase in mexico chicken sales to million 
the increase in us chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced  which resulted primarily from the acquisition of wlr foods  and to a increase in total revenue per dressed pound produced 
the increase in turkey sales was due to the acquisition of wlr foods 
the million increase in sales of other us products to million was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods and higher prices in our commercial egg operations 
the million increase in mexico chicken sales was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced offset partially by a decrease in average revenue per dressed pound produced  primarily due to lower prices caused by an over supply of chicken 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal the us operations accounted for million of the increase in the cost of sales and our mexico operations accounted for million of the increase 
the cost of sales increase in our us operations of million was due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods  million of which related to the turkey operations  but also resulted from increased production of higher cost prepared foods products  higher energy costs and higher feed ingredient costs 
the million cost of sales increase in our mexico operations was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced 
gross profit 
gross profit was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over the same period last year  due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods

selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase was due primarily to the acquisition of wlr foods and certain integration costs related thereto 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal to  compared to in fiscal  due primarily to synergies resulting from the wlr acquisition 
operating income 
consolidated operating income was million for fiscal  an increase of million when compared to fiscal  resulting primarily from higher volumes from the acquisition of wlr foods and higher sales prices in us interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due to higher outstanding balances incurred for the acquisition of wlr foods 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal increased to million compared to an expense of million in fiscal this increase resulted from higher us pre tax earnings in fiscal than in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales

the million increase in sales of other us products was primarily due to higher selling prices in our poultry by products division 
cost of sales 
consolidated cost of sales was billion in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from a million increase in the cost of sales of our us operations and from a million increase in the cost of sales in our mexico operations 
the cost of sales increase in our us operations of million was due primarily to an increase in dressed pounds produced  a increase in feed ingredient costs  increased production of higher cost prepared food products  losses associated with the late january ice storm and a million write off of accounts receivable from ameriserve  which filed bankruptcy on january  ameriserve was a significant distributor of products to fast food and casual dining restaurant chains  several of which are customers of the company 
the million cost of sales increase in our mexico operations was primarily due to a increase in dressed pounds produced and a increase in average costs of sales per dressed pound produced caused primarily by the continued shift of production to a higher valued product mix 
gross profit 
gross profit was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  over the same period last year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the lower gross profit resulted from lower net margins in our us operations primarily due to lower selling prices realized for fresh chicken products  higher feed ingredient costs  losses associated with the late january ice storm and the ameriserve write off  discussed above  offset in part by increased volume of prepared food chicken sales 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  commodity chicken margins in the us have been under pressure due  in part  to increased levels of chicken production in the us to the extent that these trends continue  subsequent periods gross margins could be negatively affected to the extent not offset by other factors such as those discussed under general above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively stable in fiscal at compared to in fiscal the million increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses was due to increased costs relating to our higher sales volumes

interest expense 
consolidated net interest expense increased to million in fiscal  when compared to million for fiscal  due to higher interest rates experienced in fiscal on lower outstanding debt levels 
income tax expense 
consolidated income tax expense in fiscal decreased to million compared to an expense of million in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower us earnings in fiscal than in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we maintain million in revolving credit facilities and million in a secured revolving term borrowing facility 
the million revolving term borrowing facility provides for million and million of year and year commitments  respectively 
borrowings under these facilities are split pro rata between the year and year maturities as they occur 
the credit facilities provide for interest at rates ranging from libor plus five eighths percent to libor plus two and three quarters percent  depending upon our total debt to capitalization ratio 
interest rates on debt outstanding under these facilities as of september  ranged from libor plus one and one quarter percent to libor plus two and one quarter percent 
these facilities are secured by inventory and fixed assets or are unsecured 
at september   million was available under the revolving credit facilities and million was available under the revolving term borrowing facility 
on september   we amended and restated our revolving credit agreement for mexico  increasing the commitment from million to million 
outstanding borrowings under this facility are presently million  the proceeds of which were used to reduce certain other debt 
on june   we entered into an asset sale agreement to sell up to million of accounts receivable 
in connection with the asset sale agreement  we sell  on a revolving basis  certain of our trade receivables the pooled receivables to a special purpose corporation wholly owned by us  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest to third parties 
at september  and september   an interest in these pooled receivables of million and million  respectively  had been sold to third parties and is reflected as a reduction in accounts receivable 
these transactions have been recorded as sales in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the gross proceeds resulting from the sale are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
losses on these sales were immaterial 
on june   the camp county industrial development corporation issued million of variable rate environmental facilities revenue bonds supported by letters of credit obtained by pilgrim s pride 
we may draw from these proceeds over the construction period for new sewage and solid waste disposal facilities at a poultry by products plant to be built in camp county  texas 
we are not required to borrow the full amount of the proceeds from the bonds 
all amounts borrowed from these funds will be due in the amounts that we borrow will be reflected as debt when received from the camp county industrial development corporation 
the interest rates on amounts borrowed will closely follow the tax exempt commercial paper rates 
presently  there are no borrowings outstanding under the bonds 
on august   pilgrim s pride issued million in senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of maturing on september  the proceeds from the notes offering were used to redeem the remaining million outstanding of our senior subordinated notes due the balance of the proceeds was used to reduce indebtedness under our million revolving term borrowing facility 
at september   our working capital increased to million and our current ratio increased to to  compared with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  and was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods 
trade accounts and other receivables were million at september   compared to million at september  the increase in trade accounts and other receivables was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods trade receivables and other accounts partially offset by the sale of receivables under the asset sale agreement discussed above 
excluding the sale of receivables  trade accounts and other receivables would have increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal inventories were million at september   compared to million at september  the million  or  increase in inventories was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were million at september   compared to million at september  the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of wlr foods 
capital expenditures of million  million and million  for fiscal years  and  respectively  were primarily incurred to acquire and expand certain facilities  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal to improve efficiencies and for the routine replacement of equipment 
we expect to finance such expenditures with available operating cash flows and existing credit facilities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal  was primarily due to an overall increase of accounts receivable  due primarily to a higher level of sales activity  increased inventories  due primarily to higher levels of live poultry and frozen turkey inventories resulting primarily from seasonal variations in the live production cycle and sales of turkey products  both of which were primarily a result of the wlr foods acquisition and lower net income for fiscal the million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities that resulted from accounts receivable was partially offset by a increase in sales of accounts receivable from million at fiscal year end to million at fiscal year end 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the sale of million in accounts receivable under the asset sale agreement mentioned above and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset partially by an increase in inventories and a decrease in operating income 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal  reflects the net proceeds from borrowings to finance the acquisition of wlr foods 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for fiscal  when compared to fiscal primarily reflects the net payments on notes payable and long term financing and debt retirements 
item a 
quanitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions the risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of feed ingredients  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions our management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
feed ingredients we purchase certain commodities  primarily corn and soybean meal 
as a result  our earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of such feed ingredients 
as market conditions dictate  we will from time to time lock in future feed ingredient prices using various hedging techniques  including forward purchase agreements with suppliers and futures contracts 
we do not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the weighted average cost of our primary feed ingredients as of september  based on our feed consumption during fiscal  such an increase would have resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately million  excluding the impact of any hedging in that period 
as of september   we had hedged of our feed requirements 
foreign currency our earnings are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the mexican peso net monetary position of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos 
we manage this exposure primarily by attempting to minimize our mexican peso net monetary position  but from time to time we have also considered executing hedges to help minimize this exposure 
such instruments  however  have historically not been economically feasible 
we are also exposed to the effect of potential exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that amounts are repatriated from mexico to the united states 
however  we currently anticipate that the cash flows of our mexico subsidiaries will continue to be reinvested in our mexico operations 
in addition  the mexican peso exchange rate can directly and indirectly impact our results of operations and financial position in several manners  including potential economic recession in mexico resulting from a devalued peso 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations of a hypothetical change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso cannot be reasonably estimated 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses  representing the change in the us dollar value of the net monetary assets of our mexico subsidiaries denominated in mexican pesos  was a loss of million in fiscal and a gain of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
on november   the mexican peso closed at to us dollar  strengthening from at september  no assurance can be given as to how future movements in the peso could affect our future earnings 
interest rates our earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt instruments 
the acquisition of wlr foods substantially increased our outstanding balances of variable rate debt 
we have variable rate debt instruments representing approximately of our long term debt at september  holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a basis points increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by million for fiscal these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate long term debt at september  market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis points decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million as of september   using discounted cash flow analysis 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized upon adoption 
sfas no 
also establishes new standards for evaluating impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company 
on october   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized in earnings 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company as of october  impact of inflation due to moderate inflation in the us and our rapid inventory turnover rate  the results of operations have not been significantly affected by inflation during the past three year period
