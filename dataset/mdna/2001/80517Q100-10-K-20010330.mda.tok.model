overview we are is engaged in the research  development  manufacture and marketing of biopharmaceutical products 
through a combination of internal research and development  acquisitions  collaborative relationships and licensing arrangements  btg has developed a portfolio of therapeutic products  including eight products that have received regulatory approval for sale  of which seven are currently being marketed  four products that are in registration or clinical trials and several products that are in pre clinical development 
we pursue the development of both products with broad markets as well as products with specialized niche markets where we can seek orphan drug designation and potential marketing exclusivity 
btg was founded in to develop  manufacture and market novel therapeutic products 
btg s overall administration  licensing  human clinical studies  marketing activities  quality assurance and regulatory affairs are primarily coordinated at our headquarters in iselin  new jersey 
pre clinical studies  research and development activities and manufacturing of btg s genetically engineered products are primarily carried out through its wholly owned subsidiary in rehovot  israel 
effective january   btg adopted staff accounting bulletin sab issued by the securities and exchange commission in december as a result of adopting sab  btg changed the way it recognizes revenue from contract fees for the license of marketing and distribution rights where the consideration is a one time nonrefundable payment 
prior to the issuance of sab  btg recorded revenue from the license of marketing and distribution rights when the rights were licensed and or when these payments were received 
effective january   btg recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to contract revenues recognized in prior years in the amount of  net of income taxes of  of which  was recognized as contract fee revenue in the related revenues are now being recognized over the term of the related agreements 
acquisition of myelos corporation on march   we acquired myelos corporation  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the nervous system 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  btg paid myelos shareholders million in a combination of cash and stock million in cash and million through the issuance of approximately  shares of our common stock based on a value of  representing the average closing price of btg s common stock for the trading day period ending one day prior to the february  date the acquisition agreement was executed 
in the event that i btg publicly announces that it will file a new drug application nda related to the use of prosaptide to treat neuropathic pain or neuropathy  ii btg receives fda minutes stating that the clinical data possessed by btg is sufficient for an nda filing for the use of prosaptide to treat neuropathic pain or neuropathy without requiring any further testing or iii btg initiates preparation of an nda for prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy the date the earliest of the foregoing occurs being the payment trigger date  then btg shall pay to the myelos shareholders an additional million  at least approximately million of which shall be paid in shares of btg common stock  valued at the average of the closing prices of btg common stock during the trading days ending on the payment trigger date  and the remainder shall be paid in cash  shares of btg common stock  or a combination thereof  as determined by btg in its sole discretion 
in addition  in the event that the fda approves the sale of prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy  btg will pay the myelos shareholders of the net sales of prosaptide for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy during the month period beginning on the earlier of i the th full month after commercial introduction of prosaptide in the united states for the treatment of neuropathic pain or neuropathy and ii april  at least of this payment must be paid in shares of btg common stock  valued at the average of the closing prices of btg common stock during the days ending one day prior to the payment  and the remainder shall be paid in cash  shares of btg common stock  or a combination thereof  as determined by btg in its sole discretion 
in no event will btg be obligated to issue in aggregate to the myelos shareholders more than  shares of btg common stock 
any amount of the contingent payments that cannot be paid in shares of btg common stock shall instead be paid in shares of btg s preferred stock 
the preferred stock will be non voting  non convertible  non transferable  non dividend paying except to the extent a cash dividend is paid on the btg common stock  with no mandatory redemption for a period of years and one day from the closing date of the acquisition  and a right to share in proceeds in liquidation  up to the liquidation amount 
the transaction will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
btg anticipates that an amount in excess of the purchase price paid at closing will be written off as in process research and development  because the technology acquired in the acquisition was not fully commercially developed and had no alternative future use at the time of the acquisition 
this non cash charge will adversely affect our results of operations for the first quarter and full year of results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentage of our revenues represented by certain items reflected on our consolidated statements of operations on both a historical and pro forma basis as if sab had been in effect since january  because btg adopted sab as of january   there is no difference between btg s actual and pro forma results of operations for the year ended december  historical pro forma revenues product sales contract fees royalties other revenues interest total revenues expenses research and development cost of product sales general and administrative marketing and sales commissions and royalties finance total expenses income before income taxes income tax expense income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income btg has historically derived its revenues from product sales as well as from collaborative arrangements with third parties  under which btg may earn up front contract fees  may receive funding for additional research including funding from the chief scientist of the state of israel chief scientist  is reimbursed for producing certain experimental materials  may be entitled to certain milestone payments  may sell product at specified prices and may receive royalties on sales of product 
we anticipate that product sales will constitute the majority of our revenues in the future 
revenues have in the past displayed and will in the immediate future continue to display significant variations due to changes in demand for our products  new product introductions by btg and its competitors  the obtaining of new research and development contracts and licensing arrangements  the completion or termination of such contracts and arrangements  the timing and amounts of milestone payments  and the timing of regulatory approvals of products 
the following table summarizes btg s sales of its commercialized products as a percentage of total product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  oxandrin bio tropin delatestryl biolon other total we believe that our product mix will change significantly as we continue to focus on i increasing market penetration of our existing products  ii expanding into new markets  and iii commercializing additional products 
the following table summarizes btg s united states and international product sales as a percentage of total product sales for the periods indicated year ended december  domestic foreign total domestic sales as a percentage of total product sales has fluctuated due primarily to a reduction in purchases of oxandrin by btg s distributor in the us from april through may comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
revenues decreased slightly in to  from  in  which represented an increase over revenues of  product sales decreased slightly in to  from  in  which itself was a decrease from product sales of  the changes in revenues and product sales between  and were primarily driven by the decision in april of gentiva health services  inc gentiva  btg s wholesale distributor for oxandrin  to reduce its purchases of oxandrin in order to reduce the amount of oxandrin inventory it carried as a result of a slowing in the rate of increase of oxandrin prescriptions 
gentiva finished this inventory reduction in may  and is now purchasing  on a monthly basis  an amount of oxandrin equal to the average end user ie  wholesaler sales during the preceding three months 
the change in revenues between  and was also influenced by contract fees received by btg  which were significantly higher in than in or  primarily as a result of btg s establishment of a strategic alliance with teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
focusing on the development and global commercialization of several generic recombinant therapeutic products and the license of distribution rights in the united states for the company s hgh and the adoption by btg in of sab  which requires that btg recognize upfront nonrefundable license payments over the term of the related agreements rather than upon receipt 
on a pro forma basis as if sab had been in effect since january   revenues in would have increased approximately to  from  which represented a less than decrease from revenues of  sales of oxandrin in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of oxandrin to gentiva in  and were   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total sales of oxandrin 
in sales of oxandrin increased  or  as gentiva completed the reduction in the amount of oxandrin inventory it carries in may sales of oxandrin in decreased  or  from levels as gentiva began in april to reduce the amount of oxandrin inventory it was carrying as a result of a slowing of the rate of increase of oxandrin prescriptions 
although sales of oxandrin to gentiva declined in  end user sales of oxandrin by gentiva increased by and prescriptions increased by in compared to end user sales of oxandrin by gentiva increased by and prescriptions increased by compared to the decrease in sales to gentiva in was partially offset by  of sales of oxandrin to third parties for distribution overseas 
sales of hgh in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods 
sales of human growth hormone increased in by  or  over sales  which itself was an increase of  or  over hgh sales 
the increase in sales of hgh in was due in part to seasonal variations in orders from btg s licensees 
sales of hgh to jcr in  and were approximately   and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of hgh to the ferring group were approximately   and  in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of btg s total product sales in those periods and  and  respectively  of btg s total hgh sales in those periods 
sales of delatestryl and biolon in decreased  and  or and  respectively  from levels 
we had no sales of delatestryl in the second and third quarters of the decrease in sales of delatestryl relates to gentiva s election to reduce its delatestryl inventory in response to its customers reduction of their inventory 
we believe that gentiva is contracting inventory in anticipation of the us food and drug administration fda permitting the production of a competing injectable testosterone product used to treat men with hypogonadism testosterone deficiency which the fda had previously stopped 
delatestryl sales in were  higher than in primarily due to the fda stopping production of the competing injectable product 
the decrease in sales of biolon in was primarily the result of a halt in product shipments to the us beginning in the first quarter of pending fda approval of a supplemental application relating to an upgrade in btg s manufacturing process to conform it to a higher standard of quality implemented by btg 
btg resumed shipments to the us in the first quarter of biolon sales increased  in for the years ended december   and  contract fees  which consist of licensing and option to license fees  amounting to   and  or  and  respectively  of total revenues  were earned from certain of btg s collaborative partners 
of the contract fees earned in   or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of bio hy   or of total contract fees  was earned as a milestone payment under btg s strategic alliance with teva focusing on the development and global commercialization of several generic recombinant therapeutic products and the license of distribution rights in the united states for btg s hgh  and  or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of the bio hep b vaccine 
under sab  contract fees in include  of contract fees paid in prior periods  or of total contract fees 
of the contract fees earned in   or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of btg s strategic alliance with teva  and  or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of the license of distribution rights for insulin on a substantially worldwide basis 
of the contract fees earned in   or of total contract fees  was earned in respect of the license of distribution rights of biolon in the united states  and  and  or and of total contract fees  respectively  were earned in respect of btg s hepatitis b vaccine and insulin products  respectively 
approximately  and  of the contract fees earned in and  respectively  have been included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
on a pro forma basis as if sab had been in effect since january   contract fees in and would have been  and  respectively  or and  respectively  of total revenues 
royalties in and consist of net royalties in respect of the mircette product in the amount of  and  royalties in consist of net royalties derived from a co promotion agreement relating to serono s recombinant human growth hormone  saizen  in the amount of  see commissions and royalties below 
other revenues consist primarily of funding from the chief scientist  which represented  and of other revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in and was derived primarily from an increase in cash balances resulting from option exercises and cash flow from operations in and research and development expense 
expenditures for research and development were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditures in was mainly due to the increase in research and development personnel and other expenses associated with these additional personnel  partially offset by a decreased level of grants by btg for clinical studies 
the increase in research and development expenditures in was primarily related to the development of a new formulation for one of btg s existing products  partially offset by the termination in of our phase iii clinical trial for superoxide dismutase which we are now conducting as a phase ii trial 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of product sales in decreased  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  primarily as a result of increased sales of oxandrin and decreased sales of delatestryl and biolon 
cost of product sales in increased  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  primarily as a result of increased sales of delatestryl and biolon and decreased sales of oxandrin 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was  and in  and  respectively 
oxandrin has a relatively low cost of manufacture as a percentage of product sales  while biolon has the highest cost to manufacture as a percentage of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales varies from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the quantity and mix of products sold 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted mainly from the fact that in we wrote off other assets relating to the development of androtab sl as a result of our decision not to continue to pursue fda approval of androtab sl 
the increase in derived mainly from that write off and legal fees resulting from the reactivation of the litigation with genentech  as well as increased compensation costs 
marketing and sales expense 
marketing and sales expense was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses primarily related to the sales and marketing force in the united states that btg established principally in the second half of and during to promote distribution of oxandrin in the united states 
the increase in each year was primarily due to additional marketing and sales expenses  primarily resulting from increased personnel and increased advertising  promotional and market research activities  arising from the growth of btg s product sales 
commissions and royalties 
commissions and royalties were   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses consist primarily of royalties to entities from which btg licensed certain of its products and to the chief scientist 
however  the increase in resulted mainly from the accrual of  net  of commissions received in respect of serono s sales of its human growth hormone to gentiva  which commissions we expect we will be required to refund because gentiva was unable to sell most of serono s human growth hormone product before it expired 
btg will return these commissions at the time the product is returned 
btg has given notice of termination of its agreement with serono pursuant to which it was co promoting to gentiva serono s recombinant human growth hormone product saizen in the united states 
serono is disputing btg s ability to terminate the agreement 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and was   and  representing approximately  and of income before income taxes 
btg s consolidated tax rate differs from the statutory rate because of israeli tax benefits  research and experimental tax credits  state and local taxes and similar items that reduce the tax rate 
we do not expect our effective consolidated tax rate to continue to decrease 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective january   btg adopted sab as a result of adopting sab  btg changed the way it recognizes revenue from contract fees for the license of marketing and distribution rights where the consideration is a one time nonrefundable payment 
prior to the issuance of sab  btg recorded revenue from the license of marketing and distribution rights when the rights were licensed and or when these payments were received 
effective january   btg recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to contract revenues recognized in prior years in the amount of  net of income taxes of  of which  was recognized as contract fee revenue in the related revenues are now being recognized over the term of the related agreements 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december   was  as compared to  at december  our cash flows have fluctuated significantly due to the impact of net income  capital spending  working capital requirements  the issuance of common stock and other financing activities 
we expect that our cash flows in the near future will be primarily determined by the levels of net income  working capital requirements  and financings  if any  undertaken by btg 
net cash increased by   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income was   and  in the same periods  respectively 
in net cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income  mainly due to the cumulative effect of the accounting change resulting from the adoption of sab of  net of income taxes due to sab and depreciation and amortization of  partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes  inventories and accounts receivable of   and  respectively 
in net cash provided by operating activities was greater than net income  mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable of  depreciation and amortization of  the write off of other assets relating to the development of androtab sl of  and an increase of accounts payable of  partially offset by an increase in inventories of  in btg used cash in operating activities primarily because of an increase in accounts receivable of  partially offset by a non cash provision for deferred income taxes of  depreciation and amortization of  and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  net cash used in investing activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of   and  in these periods  respectively  consisting in and of approximately  and  respectively  for the purchase and reconstruction of a new manufacturing facility  with the remainder in all periods primarily for laboratory and manufacturing equipment and infrastructure 
the remainder of the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for purchases and sales of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in were primarily affected by long term borrowings of  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  cash flows from financing activities in and were primarily affected by net proceeds from issuances of common stock of  and  including  from the exercise of warrants which expired on december   in these periods  respectively 
net proceeds from the sale of common stock resulted mainly from option and warrant exercises 
in april  btg purchased a manufacturing facility in israel for approximately  btg will initially locate its production activities for fibrimage at this new facility  and will thereafter move the remainder of its production activities to this facility 
we expect that construction will be completed in the second half of following completion of construction we will begin the validation process  which we currently expect will take approximately six to nine months for all products 
we expect it will cost approximately  to complete the production facility excluding the cost of purchasing the facility  of which approximately  had been expended through december  at december   btg had outstanding commitments of  related to completion of this facility 
in june btg israel entered into a  revolving credit facility with bank hapoalim bm to finance a portion of the cost of completing its new manufacturing facility 
short term borrowings under the facility are due months from the date of borrowing and long term borrowings are due five years from the date of borrowing 
loans under the facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus in the case of short term borrowings and libor plus in the case of long term borrowings 
amounts repaid under the facility can be reborrowed 
the credit facility is secured by the assets of btg israel and has been guaranteed by the company 
at december   btg had outstanding long term borrowings of  under the facility 
we maintain our funds in money market funds  commercial paper and other liquid debt instruments 
see note c and d of notes to consolidated financial statements 
btg manages its israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
the cost of btg s operations in israel  as expressed in dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the israeli shekel in relation to the us dollar 
the rate of inflation as measured by the consumer price index in israel was approximately in and in  while the shekel was devalued by approximately and less than  respectively  in these periods 
in there was no change in the consumer price index and the shekel s value in relation to the us dollar increased by approximately 
as a result  for those expenses linked to the israeli shekel  such as salaries and rent  this resulted in corresponding decreases in these costs in us dollars in  but an increase in these costs in us dollar terms in and in to the extent that expenses in shekels exceed btg s revenues in shekels which to date have consisted primarily of research funding from the chief scientist and product sales in israel  the devaluations of israeli currency have been and will continue to be a benefit to btg s financial condition 
however  should btg s revenues in shekels exceed its expenses in shekels in any material respect  the devaluation of the shekel will adversely affect btg s financial condition 
further  to the extent the devaluation of the shekel with respect to the us dollar does not substantially offset the increase in the costs of local goods and services in israel  btg s financial results will be adversely affected as local expenses measured in us dollars will increase 
we believe that our cash resources as of december   together with anticipated product sales  scheduled payments to be made to btg under its current agreements with pharmaceutical partners and third parties and continued funding from the chief scientist at current levels will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
there can  however  be no assurance that product sales will occur as anticipated  that scheduled payments will be made by third parties  that current agreements will not be canceled  that the chief scientist will continue to provide funding at current levels  that we will not use a substantial portion of our cash resources to acquire businesses  products and or technologies  or that unanticipated events requiring the expenditure of funds will not occur 
the satisfaction of btg s future cash requirements will depend in large part on the status of commercialization of btg s products  btg s ability to enter into additional research and development and licensing arrangements  and btg s ability to obtain additional equity and debt financing  if necessary 
there can be no assurance that btg will be able to obtain additional funds or  if such funds are available  that such funding will be on favorable terms 
btg continues to seek additional collaborative research and development and licensing arrangements  in order to provide revenue from sales of certain products and funding for a portion of the research and development expenses relating to the products covered  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such agreements 
see item business risk factors we may be unable to obtain any additional capital needed to operate and grow our business and we expect our quarterly results to fluctuate  which may cause volatility in our stock price 
new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 as amended  which is effective for all quarterly financials of the fiscal year beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging securities 
btg expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
to date our exposure to market risk has been limited and we are not currently hedging any market risk  although we may do so in the future 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
our obligations under our  revolving credit facility bear interest at floating rates and  therefore  we are impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on the  outstanding under this facility at december  would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of  because these borrowings relate to the construction of our new facility  interest expense is currently being capitalized 
our material interest bearing assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments consisting primarily of investments in us treasury bonds  short term corporate bonds and mutual funds which invest in short term bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources  we manage our israeli operations with the objective of protecting against any material net financial loss in us dollars from the impact of israeli inflation and currency devaluations on its non us dollar assets and liabilities 
all of btg s revenues are in us dollars except for payments from the chief scientist and sales of our products in israel  which are denominated in israeli shekels
