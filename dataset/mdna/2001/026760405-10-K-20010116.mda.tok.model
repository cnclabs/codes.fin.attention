item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income the company can earn on its investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense the company must pay with respect to its various outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited  however  to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities  which are tied to market rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company ensures the safety and preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities 
the company had short term investments of  at september  these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of between three and eighteen months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company believes a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by percent from levels at september   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to fall by an immaterial amount 
since the company is not required to sell these investments before maturity  we have the ability to avoid realizing losses on these investments due to a sudden change in market interest rates 
on the other hand  declines in the interest rates over time will reduce our interest income 
the company had outstanding convertible debt instruments of approximately  at september  these instruments have fixed interest rates ranging from to 
because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates will not have a material effect on the company 
interest rate increases  however  will increase interest expense associated with future borrowing by the company  if any 
the company does not hedge against interest rate fluctuations 
equity price risk the company through its business dealings has obtained common stock of various publicly traded technology companies  which are classified as available for sale securities 
as a result  the company values these investments on its balance sheet at september  at market value 
unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
the company has not attempted to reduce or eliminate its market exposure on these securities  and such investments were not significant to the company in the prior year 
a adverse change in equity prices  based on a sensitivity analysis of technology stocks  would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities portfolio as of september  currency exchange risk the company has historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and as such  has not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
as the company expands globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may dramatically increase 
therefore  in the future  the company may consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate such risks
