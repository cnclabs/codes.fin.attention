item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the previous section  selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which begin on page f overview we derive a substantial majority of our revenues from commissions on sales by us of national spot radio advertising air time for the radio stations we represent 
generally  advertising agencies or media buying services retained by advertisers purchase national spot advertising time 
we receive commissions from our client radio stations based on the national spot radio advertising billings of the station  net of standard advertising agency and media buying services commissions 
we enter into written representation contracts with our clients  which include negotiated commission rates 
because commissions are based on the prices paid to radio stations for spots  our revenue base is regularly and automatically adjusted for inflation 
our operating results generally depend on o changes in advertising expenditures  o increases and decreases in the size of the total national spot radio advertising market  o changes in our share of this market  o acquisitions and terminations of representation contracts  and o operating expense levels 
the effect of these factors on our financial condition and results of operations varies from period to period 
a number of factors influence the performance of the national spot radio advertising market  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  consumer attitudes and spending patterns  the amount spent on advertising generally  the share of total advertising spent on radio and the share of total radio advertising represented by national spot radio 
our share of the national spot advertising market changes as a result of increases and decreases in the amount of national spot advertising broadcast by our clients 
moreover  our market share increases as we acquire representation contracts with new client stations and decreases if current client representation contracts are terminated 
thus  our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients significantly affects our market share 
the value of representation contracts that have been acquired or terminated during the last few years has tended to increase due to a number of factors  including the consolidation of ownership in the radio broadcast industry following the passage of the telecommunications act of in recent years  we have increased our representation contract acquisition activity  and we have devoted a significant amount of our resources to these acquisitions 
at the same time  we have received an increased amount of contract termination revenue 
we base our decisions to acquire a representation contract on the market share opportunity presented and an analysis of the costs and net benefits to be derived 
we continuously seek opportunities to acquire additional representation contracts on attractive terms  while maintaining our current clients 
our ability to acquire and maintain representation contracts has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our revenues and cash flows 
we recognize revenues on a contract termination as of the effective date of the termination 
when a contract is terminated  we write off in full the unamortized portion  if any  of the expense we originally incurred on our acquisition of the contract 
when we enter into a representation contract with a new client  we amortize the contract acquisition cost in equal monthly installments over the life of the new contract 
as a result  our operating income is affected  negatively or positively  by the acquisition or loss of client stations 
we are unable to forecast any trends in contract buyout activity  or in the amount of revenues or expenses that will likely be associated with buyouts during a particular period 
generally  the amount of revenue resulting from the buyout of a representation contract depends on the length of the remaining term of the contract and the revenue generated under the contract during the month trailing period preceding the date of termination 
the amount recognized by us as contract termination revenue in any period is not  however  indicative of contract termination revenue that may be realized in any future period 
historically  the level of buyout activity has varied from period to period 
additionally  the length of the remaining terms  and the commission revenue generation  of the contracts which are terminated in any period vary to a considerable extent 
accordingly  while buyout activity and the size of buyout payments has increased since  their impact on our revenues and income is expected to be uncertain  due to the variables of contract length and commission generation 
during  we entered the internet advertising business 
revenues and expenses from this business will be affected by the level of advertising on the internet generally  the prices obtained for advertising on the internet and our ability to obtain contracts from high traffic internet websites and from internet advertisers 
in december  we merged our interep interactive business with cybereps  inc  an internet advertising and marketing firm founded in  in which we had a minority interest 
we have retained a majority interest in the combined enterprise 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
our selling and corporate expense levels are dependent on management decisions regarding operating and staffing levels and on inflation 
selling expenses represent all costs associated with our marketing  sales and sales support functions 
corporate expenses include items such as corporate management  corporate communications  financial services  advertising and promotion expenses and employee benefit plan contributions 
our business normally follows the pattern of advertising expenditures in general 
it is seasonal to the extent that radio advertising spending increases during the fourth calendar quarter in connection with the christmas season and tends to be weaker during the first calendar quarter 
radio advertising also generally increases during the second and third quarters due to holiday related advertising  school vacations and back to school sales 
additionally  radio tends to experience increases in the amount of advertising revenues as a result of special events such as presidential election campaigns 
furthermore  the level of advertising revenues of radio stations  and therefore our level of revenues  is susceptible to prevailing general and local economic conditions and the corresponding increases or decreases in the budgets of advertisers  as well as market conditions and trends affecting advertising expenditures in specific industries 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  commission revenue 
commission revenue for increased approximately to million from million for this million increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of national spot advertising on client stations and commissions generated by new representation contracts  offset  in part  by the loss of commission revenues from terminated contracts  principally those with stations owned by clear channel communications inc  which were terminated in december our revenues in increased only minimally from the fact that had weeks  as compared to weeks in  for radio broadcast purposes  as the extra week  falling between christmas and new year s day  is traditionally a very slow period for national spot radio advertising 
contract termination revenue 
contract termination revenue in increased million to million from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the slightly greater residual value of contracts terminated during than in the value of representation contracts acquired or terminated during the last few years has generally tended to increase due to the factors discussed in overview above 
nevertheless  it remains difficult to predict whether contract termination revenue will increase or decrease in a particular year and its impact on overall revenue is expected to continue to be uncertain  due to the variables of contract length and commission generation 
during  approximately client stations terminated rep contracts with us  which had generated an aggregate of approximately million of commission revenue during their month trailing periods 
the amount of contract termination revenue from the termination of the clear channel representation contracts in december has not yet been determined 
selling expenses 
selling expenses for decreased to million from million during this decrease of million  or approximately  was primarily attributable to a cost reduction program implemented in the third quarter of  offset in part by employee compensation increases associated with the growth in commission revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for from million for this increase primarily reflects new expenses related to our becoming a public company 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million  or  for  from million in the amortization of costs associated with acquiring representation contracts is included in depreciation and amortization 
this decrease of million was primarily due to the completion of the amortization of certain representation contracts 
we acquired representation contracts with approximately new radio stations in we believe these contracts generated an aggregate of approximately million of commission revenues during their month trailing periods prior to their acquisition 
operating income loss 
operating income increased by million  to income of million for compared with an operating loss of million in the largest factor contributing to this increase was the decrease in depreciation and amortization charges referred to above 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million  or  to million for  from million for this decrease primarily resulted from interest received on cash reserves  which partially offset interest payable on our senior subordinated notes 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for declined million  or  to million  compared to million for  as a result of the lower loss before taxes 
net income loss 
our net loss of approximately million for  a million decrease from the million net loss for  was due to the reasons discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  commission revenue 
commission revenue for increased to million  or  from million in this million increase was primarily attributable to the fact that commissions from new representation contracts exceeded the loss of commission revenues from terminated contracts  as well as a general increase in national spot advertising on client stations 
our new internet advertising business earned commissions of  in contract termination revenue 
contract termination revenue in decreased to million  or  from million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that a substantial amount of contract termination revenue was generated in the first quarter of as a result of the termination of our representation contracts with stations owned by sfx broadcasting  when it was acquired by clear channel 
our representation contracts with clear channel were terminated in december  but the related amount of contract termination revenue has not yet been determined 
the value of representation contracts acquired or terminated during the last few years has generally tended to increase due to the factors discussed above 
during  approximately client stations terminated rep contracts with us  which generated an aggregate of approximately million of commission revenue during their month trailing periods 
selling expenses 
selling expenses for increased to million from million during this increase of million  or approximately  was primarily due to employee compensation increases associated with the growth in commission revenues 
costs relating to our entry into the internet advertising business were million during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses declined million to million for  from million in this reduction was primarily the result of cost reduction plans including the relocation of our accounting and finance functions to florida in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million  or  for  from million in the amortization of costs associated with acquiring representation contracts is included in depreciation and amortization 
this decrease of million was primarily due to the completion of the amortization of certain representation contracts 
we acquired representation contracts with approximately new radio stations in we believe these contracts generated an aggregate of approximately million of commission revenues during their month trailing periods prior to their acquisition 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased by million  or  to a loss of million for compared with operating income of million in this decline was primarily due to the decrease in contract termination revenues discussed above 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increased to million for  from million for this increase of approximately million primarily resulted from interest charges associated with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes in july provision benefit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million to million for compared to million for  primarily as a result of the decrease in contract termination revenues in discussed above 
net income loss 
our net loss of approximately million for  a million decrease from the million net income for  was primarily due to the reduction in contract termination revenues discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operations and financing transactions has primarily funded our cash requirements 
on december  we completed our initial public offering  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
cash provided by operations during amounted to million  as compared to million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
these fluctuations were primarily attributable to contract terminations and changes in working capital components 
net cash used in investing activities during amounted to million  primarily for the purchase of marketable securities and investment in internet advertising companies 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  primarily for office and computer equipment 
investments in private companies amounted to million for and consisted of minority equity positions in three internet advertising firms 
in december  ralph guild acquired shares in one of such firms  cybereps  inc  from one of its founders at a price higher than we paid 
in february  we invested an additional million in cybereps on the same terms as our initial investment  and in december  we acquired a majority interest in cybereps through a merger of our interep interactive business with cybereps and an additional investment of million to the combined business 
investment in private companies other than cybereps amounted to million for and consisted of minority equity positions in four internet advertising firms 
additionally  in we acquired a radio promotion and marketing consulting business for an initial payment of million plus an earn out payment of up to million over the next five years 
we evaluated the carrying value of our investments in such internet advertising firms and determined  as of december   that current events and circumstances did not indicate a decline in the carrying value of the investments 
as part of the evaluation  we considered  among other factors  the business plans of these firms  the quality and effectiveness of their management teams  their liquidity and capital resource positions  and their business relationships with third parties  and concluded that an impairment had not occurred 
there can be no assurance  however  that circumstances affecting these investments  their businesses and markets in which they operate will not change in a manner which would lead to a conclusion in a future period that an impairment had occurred 
cash used for financing activities of million during consisted primarily of million for acquisitions of representation contracts and million to purchase stock 
cash provided by financing activities during and was million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the proceeds of the initial public offering  offset by cash used for acquisitions of station representation contracts 
the cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes described below  offset by acquisitions of station representation contracts and debt repayments 
in general  as we acquire new representation contracts  we use more cash and  as our contracts are terminated  we receive additional cash 
for the reasons noted above in overview  we are not able to predict the amount of cash we will require for contract acquisitions  or the cash we will receive on contract terminations  from period to period 
in july we issued senior subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million due july  interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable in semi annual payments of million 
the senior subordinated notes  while guaranteed by our subsidiaries  are unsecured and are junior to certain indebtedness 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes to repay the then outstanding balance of our bank debt 
additionally  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock  together with all of the associated shares of common stock then subject to redemption 
we issued the senior subordinated notes under an indenture that limits our ability to engage in various activities 
among other things  we are generally not able to pay any dividends to our stockholders  other than dividends payable in shares of common stock  we can only incur additional indebtedness under limited circumstances  and certain types of mergers  asset sales and changes of control either are not permitted or permit the note holders to demand immediate redemption of their senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes may not be redeemed by us prior to july   except that we may redeem up to of the senior subordinated notes with the proceeds of equity offerings 
we do not currently plan to use the remaining proceeds of our initial public offering to redeem any senior subordinated notes 
if certain events occurred which would be deemed to involve a change of control under the indenture  we would be required to offer to repurchase all of the senior subordinated notes at a price equal to of their aggregate principal  plus unpaid interest 
as of december   we terminated our million revolving credit facility 
we had never borrowed any amounts under that agreement 
we believe that the liquidity resulting from our initial public offering in december and the transactions described above  together with anticipated cash from continuing operations  should be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated needs for required representation contract acquisition payments  and to make the required annual interest payments on the senior subordinated notes  for at least the next months 
we may not  however  generate sufficient cash flow for these purposes or to repay the notes at maturity 
our ability to fund our operations and required contract acquisition payments and to make scheduled principal and interest payments will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we may also need to refinance all or a portion of the notes on or prior to maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any such refinancing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
certain factors that may affect our results of operations the following factors are some  but not all  of the variables that may have an impact on our results of operations o changes in the ownership of our radio station clients  in the demand for radio advertising  in our expenses  in the types of services offered by our competitors  and in general economic factors may adversely affect our ability to generate the same levels of revenue and operating results 
o advertising tends to be seasonal in nature as advertisers typically spend less on radio advertising during the first calendar quarter 
o the termination of a representation contract will increase our results of operations for the fiscal quarter in which the termination occurs due to the termination payments that are usually required to be paid  but will negatively affect our results in later quarters due to the loss of commission revenues 
hence  our results of operations on a quarterly basis are not predictable and are subject to significant fluctuations 
o we depend heavily on our key personnel  including our chief executive officer ralph c 
guild and the president of our marketing division marc guild  and our inability to retain them could adversely affect our business 
o we rely on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our revenues 
o our significant indebtedness from our senior subordinated notes may burden our operations  which could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  make it more difficult to obtain additional financing when needed  reduce our cash flow from operations to make payments of principal and interest and make it more difficult to react to changes in our business and industry 
o we may need additional financing for our future capital needs  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
o competition could harm our business 
our only significant competitor is katz  which is a subsidiary of a major radio station group that has significantly greater financial and other resources than do we 
in addition  radio must compete for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets with other advertising media such as television  cable  print  outdoor advertising and the internet 
o acquisitions and strategic investments could adversely affect our business 
o our internet business may suffer if the market for internet advertising fails to develop or continues to weaken 
new accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june and was subsequently amended by sfas no 
issued in june these statements require companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
depending on the use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as a hedge  gains or losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative would be recognized currently in earnings or reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the effective date of sfas no 
was delayed to fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company does not use derivative instruments and therefore the adoption of these statements will not have any impact on its financial position or results of operations
