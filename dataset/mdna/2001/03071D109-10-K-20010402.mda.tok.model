item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
general ameripath operates in two operating segments  managed and owned practices  as the largest physician and laboratory company focused on providing anatomic pathology  cancer diagnostic  genomics  and healthcare information services 
the company operates as a large group practice of pathologists in both hospital inpatient laboratories and outpatient independent laboratories 
the pathologists provide diagnostic anatomic pathology and related histologic services with particular emphasis on dermatopathology study of diseases of the skin  hematopathology study of diseases of the blood  and cytopathology study of abnormalities of the cells  as well as surgical pathology diagnostic services in connection with surgical procedures 
outpatient pathology services are performed in licensed freestanding  independent pathology laboratories owned and operated by the company 
services performed are billed to patients  medicare  medicaid  other third party payors  national clinical laboratories and attending physicians primarily on a fee for service basis  which cover both the professional and technical components of such services 
inpatient pathology services are performed under exclusive contractual arrangements with hospitals 
net revenue for inpatient pathology services is dependent in large part on the level of inpatient admissions and outpatient surgeries performed at the hospitals 
such arrangements typically provide that a pathologist will provide diagnostic pathology services for the hospital s staff physicians and serve as the medical director of the hospital s laboratories with responsibility for the clinical laboratory and histology departments  as well as the hospital s blood banking and microbiology services 
achieving growth through acquisitions is one of the company s principal business strategies 
the following table depicts the company s growth through acquisition activity 
the table includes the acquisition of inform dx in  but does not separately include any practices acquired by inform dx before being acquired by ameripath 
year ended december  number of practices acquired pathologists added outpatient laboratories added hospital contracts added at december   the company and its managed practices operated in states  with pathologists providing services in hospitals and outpatient laboratories 
the company focuses on developing regional networks  such as in the state of florida  and expanding the practices through its internal marketing efforts 
the company is revisiting its acquisition strategy  particularly its pace of acquisitions  and will focus on fold in acquisitions that will densify its operations in strategically targeted markets and larger pedestal acquisitions 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net revenue 
percentage of net revenue year ended december  net revenue operating costs cost of services selling  general and administrative expense provision for doubtful accounts amortization expense merger related charges asset impairment and related charges total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest expense and other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income induced conversion and accretion of redeemable preferred stock net income attributable to common stockholders the company completed the acquisition of eight practices in  ten practices in and practices in  the results of which are included in the company s operating results from the date of acquisition 
changes in operations between years were primarily due to these acquisitions 
the acquisition of inform dx was accounted for as a pooling of interest and therefore all prior year amounts have been restated to reflect the combined historical operations of inform dx and ameripath 
net revenues ameripath derives its net revenue from the operations of the owned and managed practices 
net revenue was comprised of net patient service revenue from our owned practices and net management service revenue from our managed practices 
net patient revenues 
the majority of services furnished by ameripath s pathologists are anatomic pathology diagnostic services 
medicare reimbursement for these services represented approximately  and of ameripath s cash collections in  and  respectively 
the company typically bills government programs principally medicare and medicaid  indemnity insurance companies  managed care organizations  national clinical laboratories  physicians and patients 
net revenue differs from amounts billed for services due to 
medicare and medicaid reimbursements are limited to annually established rates  
payments from managed care organizations limited to discounted fee for service rates  
negotiated reimbursement rates with other third party payors  
rates negotiated under sub contracts with national clinical laboratories for the provision of anatomic pathology services  and 
other discounts and allowances 
in recent years  there has been a shift away from traditional indemnity insurance plans to managed care as employers and other payors move their participants into lower cost plans 
ameripath benefits more from patients covered by medicare and traditional indemnity insurance than managed care organizations and national clinical laboratories  which contract directly under capitated agreements with managed care organizations to provide clinical as well as anatomic pathology services 
the company also contracts with national clinical laboratories and is attempting to increase the number of such contracts to increase test volume 
since the majority of the ameripath s operating costs principally the compensation of physicians and non physician technical personnel are relatively fixed  increases in volume  whether from indemnity or non indemnity plans  enhance ameripath s profitability 
historically  net patient service revenue from capitated contracts has represented an insignificant amount of total net patient service revenue 
virtually all of ameripath s net patient service revenue is derived from the practices charging for services on a fee for service basis 
accordingly  the company assumes the financial risk related to collection  including potential uncollectability of accounts  long collection cycles for accounts receivable and delays in reimbursement by third party payors  such as governmental programs  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
increases in write offs of doubtful accounts  delays in receiving payments or potential retroactive adjustments and penalties resulting from audits by payors may require ameripath to borrow funds to meet its current obligations or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on ameripath s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to services billed on a fee for service basis  the hospital based pathologists have supervision and oversight responsibility for their roles as medical directors of the hospitals clinical  microbiology and blood banking operations 
for this role  ameripath bills non medicare patients according to a fee schedule for what is referred to as clinical professional component charges 
for medicare patients  the pathologist is typically paid a director s fee or a part a fee by the hospital 
for the year ended december   the company recorded approximately million of revenue from director fees 
for the year  the company estimates that director fees will be approximately million 
hospitals and third party payors are continuing to increase pressure to reduce the payment of these clinical component billing charges and part a fees  and in the future ameripath may sustain substantial decreases in these payments 
medicare calculates and reimburses fees for all physician services part b fees  including anatomic pathology services  based on a methodology known as the resource based relative value system rbrvs  which medicare began phasing in since and had fully implemented by overall  anatomic pathology reimbursement rates declined during the fee schedule phase in period  despite an increase in payment rates for certain pathology services performed by ameripath 
the medicare part b fee schedule payment for each service is determined by multiplying the total relative value units rvus established for the service by a geographic practice cost index gpci 
the sum of this value is multiplied by a statutory conversion factor 
the number of rvus assigned to each service is in turn calculated by adding three separate components work rvu intensity of work  practice expense rvu expense related to performing the service and malpractice rvu malpractice costs associated with the service 
bba added coverage for an annual screening pap smear for medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk of developing cervical or vaginal cancer and for beneficiaries of childbearing age effective january   as well as coverage for annual prostate cancer screening  including a prostate specific antigen blood test  for beneficiaries over age  effective january  although most women of childbearing age and men under age are not medicare beneficiaries  the addition of medicare coverage for these tests could provide additional revenues for the company 
with the bba  congress merged the three existing conversion factors into one for all types of services provided resulting in a single conversion factor 
in july  hcfa announced several proposed rule changes  and issued a final rule on november  that impacts payment for pathology services 
the changes include a the implementation of resource based malpractice relative value units rvus  which should not significantly change reimbursement  and b as noted above  the regulations required hcfa to develop a methodology for resource based practice expense rvus for each physician service beginning in the balanced budget act of provided for a four year transition period 
hcfa has established  and is proposing  a new methodology for computing resource based practice expense that uses available practice expense data 
in the november  final rule  an interim solution was developed which created a separate practice expense pool for all services with zero work rvus 
as published in the final rule  certain reimbursement codes were removed from the zero work rvu pool 
the impact of these procedures from the zero work pool varies by procedure and geographic region 
the impact of the changes for pathology revenue were estimated by hcfa to be  however  the magnitude of the impact that medicare has on ameripath depends upon the mix of medicare and non medicare services 
for those outpatient facilities that ameripath bills globally  the average percentage increase is for a common cpt code on august   the final update to the medicare physician fee schedule database was published by hfca 
the changes included increases to various codes including cpt code increases vary by region and averaged 
in addition  hcfa announced that it will cease the direct payment by medicare for the technical component of inpatient physician pathology services to an outside independent laboratory on the basis that it believes that the cost of the technical component for inpatient services is already included in the payment to hospitals under the hospital inpatient prospective payment system 
implementation of this change was scheduled to commence january  congress  however  recently grandfathered certain existing hospital lab arrangements 
the physician fee schedule conversion factor increased from to in hcfa has increased the physician fee schedule conversion factor from to in due to the implementation of the hospital outpatient prospective payment system pps  effective as of january   independent pathology laboratories providing services to hospital outpatients will no longer be able to bill medicare for the technical component tc of those services 
rather  they will need to bill the hospital for the tc 
the hospital will be reimbursed as part of the new ambulatory payment classification apc payment system 
this change will require new billing arrangements be made with the hospitals which may result in an increase in the amount of time necessary for collections and reduction in the amounts paid 
the actual change in revenue has not been determined due to current negotiations in progress with the hospitals 
there can be no assurance that these changes will not have an adverse effect on the company 
as indicated above  a significant portion of ameripath s net patient service revenue is from payments by government sponsored health care programs  principally medicare and medicaid  and is subject to audit and adjustments by applicable regulatory agencies 
failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations  the results of increased regulatory audits and adjustments  or changes in the interpretation of the coding of services or the amounts payable for services under these programs could have a material adverse effect on ameripath s financial position and results of operations 
the impact of legislative changes on ameripath s results of operations will depend upon several factors  including the mix of inpatient and outpatient pathology services  the amount of medicare business  and changes in conversion factors budget neutrality adjustments which are published in november of each year 
management continuously monitors changes in legislation impacting reimbursement 
in prior years  ameripath has been able to mitigate the impact of reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for anatomic pathology services through the achievement of economies of scale and the introduction of alternative technologies that are not dependent upon reimbursement through the rbrvs system 
despite any offsets  the recent substantial modifications to the physician fee schedule  along with additional adjustments by medicare  could have an effect on the average unit reimbursement in the future 
in addition  other third party payors could adjust their reimbursement based on changes to the medicare fee schedule 
any reductions made by other payors could have a negative impact on the average unit reimbursement 
management service revenue 
net management service revenue is based on a predetermined percentage of net operating income of the practices managed by the company plus reimbursement of certain practice expenses as defined in each management service agreement 
management fees are recognized at the time the physician group revenue is recorded by the physician group 
the underlying calculation of net management service revenue is net physician group revenue less amounts retained by the physician groups physician group retainage 
net physician group revenue is equal to billed charges reduced by provisions for bad debt and contractual adjustments 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between amounts billed and amounts reimbursable by commercial insurers and other third party payors pursuant to their respective contracts with the physician group 
the provision for bad debt represents management s estimate of potential credit issues associated with amounts due from patients  commercial insurers  and other third party payors 
physician group retainage is the net physician group revenue less practice expenses and management fee charged by the company in accordance with the terms of the service agreement 
the following table illustrates the computation of net management service revenue 
gross physician group revenue xxx contractual adjustments and bad debt expense xxx net physician group revenue xxx less amounts retained by physician groups xxx net management service revenue xxx net revenue for the year increased by million  or  from million for to million for during the fourth quarter  management reviewed the collectibility of inform dx s accounts receivable in light of historical collections  aging of accounts receivable  ameripath s reserve methods and policies  and billing and collection performance 
in addition  two of inform dx s laboratories converted billing systems in the fourth quarter of as the result of these conversions  the billings and collections for were negatively impacted 
based on this review and evaluation  during the fourth quarter ameripath recorded an additional estimated allowance against accounts receivable of million 
since the majority of this allowance relates to the accounts receivable of the managed practices  as discussed above  the additional allowance was recorded as a reduction of net management service revenue 
without the million adjustment to net revenue  net revenue would have increased million or over the year ended of the million increase  million resulted from the operations of practices acquired during and same practice net revenue for increased by million  or  over the prior year 
of the same practice increase ameripath estimates that approximately million resulted from the increase in medicare reimbursement in the remaining million resulted from a combination of volume increases and price impacts of other payors 
same practice outpatient net revenue increased million  or  same practice hospital net revenue increased million  or  and management service revenue increased million  or  compared to the same period of the prior year 
the expansion of the new york operation contributed approximately million to the same practice outpatient growth for the year reference to same practice means practices at which the company provided services for the entire period for which the amount is calculated and the entire prior comparable period  including acquired hospital contracts  the new york lab operations and expanded ancillary testing services added to existing practices 
during  approximately million  or  of ameripath s revenue was from contracts with national labs including quest and labcorp 
this represents a increase over the prior year revenue from national lab contracts of approximately million 
effective december   quest terminated ameripath s pathology contract in south florida 
in  this contract accounted for approximately million of net patient service revenue 
this contract termination resulted in a million asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in addition  during the fourth quarter ameripath discontinued its quest work in san antonio 
although the company has had these national lab contracts for a number of years  these types of decisions by quest and or labcorp to discontinue or redirect pathology services  at any or all of its practices  could have a material adverse effect on ameripath s financial position and results of operations 
approximately of ameripath s net revenue comes from pathology contracts with hca hospitals 
generally  these contracts and other hospital contracts have remaining terms of less than five years and contain renewal provisions 
some of the contracts also contain clauses that allow for termination by either party with relatively short notice 
hca has been under government investigation for some time and is evaluating its operating strategies  including the sale  spin off or closure of certain hospitals 
during  hca closed one hospital and sold another hospital where the company provided pathology services 
the estimated net revenue from the loss of these contracts was less than of consolidated net patient revenue 
further closures and or sales of hca hospitals could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
although the company  through its acquisitions  has had relationships with these and other hospitals for extended periods of time  the termination of one or more of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
net revenue for increased by million  or  from million for to million for of this increase  million was attributable to the acquisitions the company completed during and same practice net revenue for increased by million  or 
for  same practice hospital net revenue increased million  or  same practice outpatient net revenue increased million  or and management service revenue increased million or compared to during  the company experienced a medicare reimbursement decrease  which was effective january  reference to same practice means practices at which the company provided services for the entire period for which the amount is calculated and the entire prior comparable period  including acquired hospital contracts and expanded ancillary testing services added to existing practices 
the percent of the company s net revenue from outpatient and inpatient pathology and management services is presented below 
the type and mix of business  outpatient  inpatient or management service  which changes as a result of new acquisitions  may change the ratio of operating costs to net revenue  specifically the provision for doubtful accounts  as noted in the sections that follow 
year ended december  revenue type outpatient inpatient management service revenues cost of services cost of services consists principally of the compensation and fringe benefits of pathologists  licensed technicians and support personnel  laboratory supplies  shipping and distribution costs and facility costs 
cost of services for increased by million  or  from million for to million for cost of services  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in gross margin decreased from approximately in to in excluding the impact of the increased reimbursement from medicare  the gross margin would have decreased to approximately 
the increase in cost of services  and corresponding reduction in gross margin  results primarily from higher pathologist and medical technicians salaries and medical malpractice and health benefit costs 
while we attempt to mitigate the impact of these higher costs through productivity increases  we expect to see continuing rising costs in these areas for cost of services for increased by million  or  from million for to million for cost of services  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in to in gross margin decreased from approximately in to in a portion of the decline is related to the decrease in medicare reimbursement rates 
in addition  the company incurred expenses related to the start up of a de novo outpatient dermatopathology laboratory in new york 
this facility commenced operations in late july excluding the results of operations for the new york start up  the company s gross margin would have been approximately in selling  general and administrative expense the cost of corporate support  sales and marketing  and billing and collections comprise the majority of what is classified as selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
sg a expense  as a percentage of net revenues decreased from in to in  as the company imposed measures to control the growth in these costs and continued to spread these costs over a larger revenue base 
an objective of the company is to decrease these costs as a percentage of net revenues  however  these costs  as a percentage of net revenue  may increase as we continue to invest in marketing  information systems and billing operations 
for  ameripath expects to make significant investments in sales and marketing focused on attaining double digit same practice revenue growth 
therefore the company does not expect any significant reduction in the ratio of sg a to net revenue in sg a expense for increased by million  or  from million for to million for a portion of the increase relates to the acquisitions made during and the remaining increase was due to increased staffing levels in marketing  billing  human resources and accounting and costs incurred to expand the company s administrative support infrastructure and to upgrade information systems 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts  which relates to our owned practices  increased by million  or  from million for to million for the dollar increase is primarily due to the increase in net revenues and accounts receivable from the acquisitions completed during and the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was and for and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to a shift in revenue mix from management service to outpatient 
management service revenue has no associated bad debt expense compared to outpatient that has a to ratio of bad debt to revenue 
the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue is higher for inpatient hospital services than for outpatient or management services due primarily to a larger concentration of indigent and private pay patients  more difficulties gathering complete and accurate billing information  and longer billing and collection cycles for inpatient services 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  from million for  to million for the same period in the dollar increase is primarily due to the increase in net revenues and accounts receivable from the acquisitions completed during and the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to an overall increase in hospital based revenues 
net revenue from hospital inpatient services increased as a percentage of consolidated net revenue from in to in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue is higher for inpatient hospital services than for outpatient services due primarily to a larger concentration of indigent and private pay patients  more difficulties gathering complete and accurate billing information  and longer billing and collection cycles for inpatient services 
provision for estimated third party payor settlements and adjustments are estimated in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
the provision and the related allowance are adjusted periodically  based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience with specific payors for particular services  anticipated collection levels with specific payors for new services  industry reimbursement trends  and other relevant factors 
amortization expense the company s acquisitions completed since resulted in significant increases in net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  which include hospital contracts  physician client lists  management service agreements and laboratory contracts acquired in the acquisitions were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of the company s total assets 
net identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are amortized over periods ranging from to years  with a weighted average of years as of december  the company amortizes goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years  with a weighted average of years as of december  there can be no assurance that the company will ever realize the value of intangible assets 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may warrant revisions to the carrying values of its goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  or to the estimated useful lives assigned to such assets 
any significant impairment recorded on the carrying values of the company s goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
such impairment would be recorded as a charge to operating profit and reduction in intangible assets 
see the discussion of asset impairment charges below 
amortization expense increased by million  or  from million for to million for this increase is attributable to the amortization of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets from the acquisitions the company completed during and a full year of amortization from the acquisitions the company completed during in addition  during ameripath made contingent note payments totaling million 
these contingent note payments are recorded as goodwill and therefore create additional amortization expense 
amortization expense is expected to increase on an annual basis as a result of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill arising from future acquisitions and any contingent payments required to be made pursuant to the acquisitions completed since amortization expense  as a percentage of net revenues  was and in and  respectively 
amortization expense increased by million  or  from million for to million for this increase is attributable to the amortization of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets from the acquisitions the company completed during and a full year of amortization from the acquisitions the company completed during in addition  during ameripath made contingent note payments totaling million 
these contingent note payments are recorded as goodwill and therefore create additional amortization expense 
amortization expense  as a percentage of net revenues  was in both and merger related charges and asset impairment and related charges special charges during  ameripath recorded special charges totaling million  for merger related charges  an allowance against uncollectible accounts receivable related to ameripath s acquisition of inform dx and certain asset impairment charges 
ameripath expects to record an additional million of merger related charges in the first quarter of the following summarizes these special charges by category for and first quarter estimates for in millions 
q merger related charges see below allowance against accounts receivable see previous discussion asset impairment and related charges see below total special charges based on the above  the special charges for and the first quarter of are estimated to be million 
of the total million in special charges  approximately million are non cash charges and the remaining million are cash charges 
as of december   the company has paid million of the cash charges 
the remaining cash charges of million will be paid out million  million and  in  and  respectively 
during  the company had discussed these special charges with its bank syndicate and received amendments that allow million of these charges to be excluded from its covenant computations 
the million of charges in excess of the million allowed resulted from the formalization of the inform dx integration plans  and are expected to result in further synergies 
these additional charges could have caused the company to be in technical default of one or more of its covenants under its credit facility at the end of the first quarter of effective march   the company and the lenders executed an amendment to the credit facility which excludes an additional million  or million in total  of charges from its covenant calculations 
in addition  the amendment i increased the company s borrowing rate by basis points  ii requires the company to use a minimum of equity for all acquisitions  iii requires the company to use no more than of consideration for acquisitions in the form of contingent notes and  iv requires lender approval of all acquisitions with a purchase price greater than million 
the company will also be required to pay an amendment fee of up to basis points to those lenders which consent to the amendment 
the maximum amount of the amendment fee would be  the merger related charges of million in relate to ameripath s acquisition of inform dx and include transaction costs  change in control payments and costs related to the closing of the inform dx corporate office in nashville 
of the million  approximately million related to transaction costs and million related to employee related costs of closing the nashville facility 
ameripath expects to record an additional million of merger related charges in the first quarter of related primarily to the consolidation or closing of the overlapping operations of inform dx in new york and pennsylvania 
based on its current plans  ameripath expects to complete the closing of the nashville operations by the end of the second quarter and the integration of the new york and pennsylvania operations by the end of the third quarter of the restructuring of the combined operations of ameripath and inform dx should result in potential annual operating synergies of to million 
since the majority of the positive effect of such savings on operations will not begin to be realized until the second half of  ameripath expects the acquisition of inform dx to be nominally dilutive for the first six months and accretive for the year as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the second quarter of ameripath recorded a pre tax non cash charge of approximately million and related cash charges of approximately  in connection with the impairment of intangible assets at an acquired practice in cleveland  ohio 
during the fourth quarter of  ameripath recorded a pre tax non cash charge of approximately million related to the impairment of certain intangible assets 
million of the fourth quarter charge relates to quest diagnostics termination of its contract with ameripath in south florida  effective december  the net patient service revenue in related to this contract was approximately million 
although the company has aggressively marketed and retained a portion of this operating income  accounting rules require a charge to be taken  as there is no longer a contract 
in addition to the million  during the fourth quarter  a hospital in south florida where ameripath had the pathology contract  requested proposals for its pathology services  and ameripath was unsuccessful in retaining this contract 
based upon the remaining projected cash flow from this hospital network  the company determined that the intangible assets were impaired and recorded a pre tax non cash charge of approximately million 
for  this contract accounted for approximately  of net revenue 
interest expense interest expense increased by million  or  from million for to million for the increase was due in part to an increase in the average outstanding balance under the credit facility 
in  the average indebtedness under the credit facility was million  compared to million outstanding in in addition  the effective interest rate on the credit facility increased from to primarily due to the periodic increases in interest rates during the year by the federal reserve board and the expiration of the interest rate swap in october the interest rate swap was renewed in october at approximately plus the credit spread currently compared to plus credit spread for the expired swap  therefore increasing interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  from million for  to million for the increase was due in part to an increase in the average indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
in  average indebtedness outstanding was million  compared to million outstanding in this increase in average indebtedness was offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate from to primarily due to the interest rate swap that was in effect for all of this interest rate swap was entered into in october income tax rate the effective income tax rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
generally  the effective tax rate is higher than ameripath s statutory rates primarily due to the non deductibility of the goodwill amortization and section a adjustments cash to accrual related to the company s acquisitions 
in addition  for ameripath had non deductible asset impairment charges and merger related charges  which further increased the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for  excluding these items would have been approximately 
liquidity and capital resources at december   ameripath had working capital of million  a decrease of million from the working capital of million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to an increase in net accounts receivable of million  offset by an increase in current liabilities related to merger related charges associated with the acquisition of inform dx of million and accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the majority of these changes resulted from ameripath s acquisitions completed during ameripath manages its cash balances against amounts available under its revolving credit facility 
cash balances  for the most part  are managed on a zero balance basis and all available cash flows are used to reduce outstanding debt in order to minimize interest cost 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operations was million and million  respectively 
excluding pooling merger related charges paid for inform dx of million  cash flow from operations would have been s million 
for the year ended december   cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s credit facility were used primarily i for capital expenditures aggregating million  ii to fund the million cash portion of the acquisitions the company  iii for payments on ameripath s contingent notes of million  iv to pay million of other merger related charges  mainly inform dx  v for the million investment in gci and vi to make  in principal payments on long term debt 
during  the company acquired nine anatomic pathology practices  including the two practices acquired by inform dx 
the total consideration paid by the company in connection with these acquisitions included cash of million and approximately  shares of common stock aggregate value of million based upon amounts recorded on the company s consolidated financial statements 
generally  the shares of common stock  excluding the two practices acquired by inform dx  are restricted as to transfer  which restrictions lapse over three to five years  based solely on the passage of time 
the company issued approximately  shares of common stock  shares of which are included above in exchange for all the outstanding common stock of inform dx 
in addition  the company assumed certain obligations to issue shares of common stock pursuant to outstanding inform dx stock option plans 
at december   the company had million available under its credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by fleet national bank formerly bankboston  na the amended facility provides for borrowings of up to million in the form of a revolving loan that may be used for working capital purposes and to fund acquisitions to the extent not otherwise used for working capital purposes 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving loan with an annual effective interest rate of 
see previous discussion regarding the recent amendment to the credit facility 
in may  the company entered into three interest rate swaps transactions with an effective date of october   variable maturity dates  and a combined notional amount of million 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for details on these new swap agreements 
these interest rate swap transactions involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received is accrued and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are indexed to day libor 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate volatility and associated risks arising from the floating rate structure of its credit facility and are not held or issued for trading purposes 
the company is required by the terms of its credit facility to keep some form of interest rate protection in place 
at december   the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the company s acquisitions  the company generally agrees to pay a minimum purchase price and to pay additional purchase price consideration to the sellers of the practices in proportion to their respective ownership interest in each practice 
the additional payments are generally contingent upon the achievement of stipulated levels of operating earnings by each of the practices over periods of three to five years from the date of the acquisition as set forth in the respective agreements  and are not contingent on the continued employment of the sellers of the practices 
in certain cases  the payments are contingent upon other factors such as the retention of certain hospital contracts for periods ranging from three to five years 
the amount of the payments cannot be determined until the achievement of the operating earnings levels or other factors during the terms of the respective agreements 
if the maximum specified levels of operating earnings for each practice are achieved  the company would make aggregate maximum payments  including principal and interest  of approximately million over the next three to five years 
at the mid point level  the aggregate principal and interest would be approximately million over the next three to five years 
a lesser amount or no payments at all would be made if the stipulated levels of operating earnings specified in each agreement are not met 
through december   the company made contingent note and interest payments aggregating million  which amounts  represent of the maximum amount payable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  the company s capital expenditures have been primarily for laboratory equipment  it equipment and leasehold improvements 
total capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  capital expenditures included approximately million related to it  million for laboratory equipment  million for leasehold improvements and million for office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
during  capital expenditures included approximately million related to information systems  million for laboratory equipment  million for leasehold improvements  million for the construction of the new york lab and million for the new billing system at the consolidated billing office in fort lauderdale 
during  capital expenditures included approximately million related to information systems  million for laboratory equipment and  for leasehold improvements 
planned capital expenditures for are estimated to be million to million  with priority being given to the new billing system at the consolidated billing office in fort lauderdale and enhancements in financial and lab information systems 
historically  the company has funded its capital expenditures with cash flows from operations 
for the years ended december   and  capital expenditures were approximately  and of net revenue  respectively 
the company is consolidating and integrating its financial information  billing and collection systems  which may result in an increase in capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenue 
the company believes  however  that such information systems enhancements will result in cost savings that may enable the company to continue to fund its capital expenditures with cash flows from operations 
the company expects to continue to use its credit facility to fund acquisitions and for working capital 
the company anticipates that funds generated by operations and funds available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and contingent note obligations  and to finance capital expenditures over the next months 
further  in the event payments under the contingent notes issued in connection with acquisitions become due  the company believes that the incremental cash generated from operations would exceed the cash required to satisfy the company s payment  if any  of the contingent obligations in any one year period 
such payments  if any  will result in a corresponding increase in goodwill and the related amount of amortization thereof in periods following the payment 
funds generated from operations and funds available under the credit facility may not be sufficient to implement the company s longer term growth strategy 
the company may be required to seek additional financing through additional increases in the credit facility  to negotiate credit facilities with other banks or institutions or to seek additional capital through private placements or public offerings of equity or debt securities

forward looking statements are sometimes indicated by words such as may  should  believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties identified elsewhere herein and in other documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating the company s business and future prospects general economic conditions  competition and changes in competitive factors  the extent of success of the company s operating initiatives and growth strategies including without limitation  the company s continuing efforts to i achieve continuing improvements in performance of its current operations  by reason of various synergies  marketing efforts  revenue growth  cost savings or otherwise  ii transition into becoming a fully integrated healthcare diagnostic information provider  including the company s efforts to develop  and the company s investment in  new products  services  technologies and related alliances  such as the alliance with genomics collaborative  inc  iii acquire or develop additional pathology practices as further described below  and iv develop and expand its managed care and national clinical lab contracts  federal and state healthcare regulation and compliance  reimbursement rates under government sponsored and third party healthcare programs and the payments received under such programs  changes in coding  changes in technology  dependence upon pathologists and contracts  the ability to attract  motivate  and retain pathologists  labor and technology costs  marketing and promotional efforts  the availability of pathology practices in appropriate locations that the company is able to acquire on suitable terms or develop  the successful completion and integration of acquisitions and achievement of planned or expected synergies  access to sufficient amounts of capital on satisfactory terms  and tax laws 
in addition  the company s strategy to penetrate and develop new markets involves a number of risks and challenges and there can be no assurance that the healthcare regulations of the new states in which the company enters and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the factors which may influence the company s success in each targeted market in connection with this strategy include the selection of appropriate qualified practices  negotiation  execution and consummation of definitive acquisition  affiliation  management and or employment agreements  the economic stability of each targeted market  compliance with state  local and federal healthcare and or other laws and regulations in each targeted market including health  safety  waste disposal and zoning laws  compliance with applicable licensing approval procedures  restrictions under labor and employment laws  especially non competition covenants 
past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results 
certain of the risks  uncertainties and other factors discussed or noted above are more fully described elsewhere in this report  including under the caption risk factors below 
risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in any such case  you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
our business could be harmed by future interpretation or implementation of state laws regarding prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine 
we acquire or affiliate with physician practices located in many states across the country 
however  the laws of many states prohibit business corporations  including ameripath and its subsidiaries  from owning corporations that employ physicians  or from exercising control over the medical judgments or decisions of physicians 
these laws and their interpretations vary from state to state and are enforced by both the courts and regulatory authorities  each with broad discretion 
the manner in which we operate each practice is determined primarily by the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of the state in which the practice is located and other applicable regulations 
we believe that we are currently in material compliance with the corporate practice of medicine laws in each of the states in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities or other parties will not assert that we are engaged in the unauthorized corporate practice of medicine 
if such a claim were successfully asserted in any jurisdiction  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties under such jurisdiction s laws and could be required to restructure our contractual and other arrangements 
alternatively  some of our existing contracts could be found to be illegal and unenforceable 
in addition  expansion of our operations to other corporate practice states may require structural and organizational modification to the form of relationship that we currently have with physicians  affiliated practices and or hospitals 
such results or the inability to successfully restructure contractual arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be hurt by future interpretation or implementation of federal anti kickback laws 
the federal anti kickback law and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation and receipt of any form of remuneration  either directly or indirectly  in return for  or to induce the referral of an individual for a service for which payment may be made by medicare and medicaid or certain other federal health care programs  or the purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for  or recommending the purchase  lease or order of  any service or item for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or certain other federal health care programs 
violations of federal anti kickback law are punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
several states have similar laws 
the federal government has published regulations that provide safe harbors that protect business transactions that meet enumerated requirements from prosecution under the federal anti kickback law 
the failure to meet the requirements of a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that a transaction violates the anti kickback law 
while arrangements that we enter into with physicians and third parties may not satisfy all requirements under applicable safe harbors  we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable medicare and fraud and abuse laws  including the anti kickback law 
there is a risk however  that the federal government might investigate arrangements which do not satisfy the safe harbors 
if our arrangements with physicians and third parties were found to be illegal  we would be subject to civil and criminal penalties  including exclusion from the participation in government payor programs  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the department of health and human services office of the inspector general issues advisory opinions that provide advice on whether proposed business arrangements violate the anti kickback statute 
in advisory opinion  the oig opined that when prices for laboratory services for non governmental patients are discounted below medicare reimbursable rate  the anti kickback statute may be implicated 
the oig found prices discounted below the laboratory supplier s costs to be particularly problematic 
in the same opinion  oig suggests that a laboratory may be excluded from federal health care programs if it charges medicare or medicaid amounts substantially in excess of discounted charges to the physician 
in the oig s opinion  charges are likely excessive if the profit margin for medicare business exceeds profit margin for non federally reimbursed business 
the oig also has addressed physician practice management arrangements in an advisory opinion 
in advisory opinion  the oig found that management fees based on a percentage of practice revenues may violate the anti kickback statute 
although these advisory opinions only apply to the parties who request them  in the event that we our found to have arrangements that are inconsistent with the oig s opinions  the oig might take the position that the arrangements violate the anti kickback law 
any such finding could have a material adverse impact on us 
our business could be harmed by future interpretation or implementation of the federal stark law and other state and federal anti referral laws 
we are also subject to federal and state statutes and regulations banning payments for referral of patients and referrals by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship 
the federal stark law applies to medicare and medicaid and prohibits a physician from referring patients for certain services  including laboratory services  to an entity with which a physician has a financial relationship 
financial relationship includes both investment interests in an entity and compensation arrangements with an entity 
if an arrangement is covered by the stark law  all of the requirements of the stark law exception must be satisfied 
many states also have laws that are similar to the stark law 
these statutes and regulations generally apply to services reimbursed by both governmental and private payors 
violations of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered  loss of licenses as well as fines and criminal penalties 
in addition  violation of the stark law may result in exclusion from medicare and medicaid 
state statutes and regulations affecting the referral of patients to health care providers range from statutes and regulations that are substantially the same as the federal laws and the safe harbor regulations to a requirement that physicians or other health care professionals disclose to patients any financial relationship the physicians or health care professionals have with a health care provider that is being recommended to the patients 
these laws and regulations vary significantly from state to state  are often vague and  in many cases  have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 
adverse judicial or administrative interpretations of any of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  expansion of our operations to new jurisdictions  or new interpretations of laws in existing jurisdictions  could require structural and organizational modifications of our relationships with physicians to comply with that jurisdiction s laws 
such structural and organizational modifications could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have financial relationships with our physicians  as defined by the federal stark law  in the form of compensation arrangements  ownership of our shares  contingent promissory notes issued by us in connection with acquisitions  or a combination of the above 
we believe that such existing compensation arrangements are structured to comply with an applicable stark law exception 
we also believe that the ownership of our shares by physicians should fall within the publicly traded stock exception to the stark law s definition of financial relationship 
however  certain physician owned shares do have transfer restrictions and  as a result  the government could take the position that all of the requirements of this exception are not met 
the contingent notes held by some physicians do not meet an exception to the stark law s definition of financial relationship 
in either case  however  we believe that our current operations comply with the stark law because physicians affiliated with us ordinarily do not make referrals and in any event have been instructed  and are believed to be following such instructions  not to make referrals to us 
to the extent physicians affiliated with us may make a referral to us and a financial relationship exists between us and the referring physician through either the ownership of our shares or contingent notes  the government might take the position that the arrangement does not comply with the federal stark law 
any such finding may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial conditions or results from operations 
we could be hurt by future interpretation or implementation of state and federal anti trust laws 
in connection with the corporate practice of medicine laws  the physician practices with which we are affiliated in some states are organized as separate legal entities 
as such  the physician practice entities may be deemed to be persons separate both from us and from each other under the antitrust laws and  accordingly  subject to a wide range of laws that prohibit anti competitive conduct among separate legal entities 
in addition  we are seeking to acquire or affiliate with established and reputable practices in our target geographic markets 
we believe that we are in compliance with these laws and intend to comply with any state and federal laws that may affect our development of integrated health care delivery networks 
however  we cannot assure you that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities would not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results from operations 
our business could be harmed by future interpretation or implementation of the health care insurance portability and accountability act the health care insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  created criminal provisions  which impose criminal penalties for fraud against any health care benefit program for theft or embezzlement involving health care and for false statements in connection with the payment of any health benefits 
hipaa also provided broad prosecutorial subpoena authority and authorized property forfeiture upon conviction of a federal health care offense 
significantly  the hipaa provisions apply not only to federal programs  but also to private health benefit programs as well 
hipaa also broadened the authority of the oig to exclude participants from federal health care programs 
because of the uncertainties as to how the hipaa provisions will be enforced  we are currently unable to predict their ultimate impact on us 
although we are unaware of any current violations of hipaa  the government may in the future seek penalties against us for violations of hipaa  which could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition or results from operations 
we charge our clients on a fee for service basis  so we incur financial risk related to collections as well as potentially long collection cycles when seeking reimbursement from third party payors 
substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our practices charging for services on a fee for service basis 
accordingly  we assume the financial risk related to collection  including the potential uncollectability of accounts  long collection cycles for accounts receivable and delays attendant to reimbursement by third party payors  such as governmental programs  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
increases in write offs of doubtful accounts  delays in receiving payments or potential retroactive adjustments and penalties resulting from audits by payors may require us to borrow funds to meet our current obligations or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely upon reimbursement from government programs for a significant portion of our revenues  and if reimbursement rates from government programs decline  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we derive approximately of our collections from payments made by government sponsored health care programs principally medicare and medicaid 
these programs are subject to substantial regulation by federal and state governments 
any change in reimbursement regulations  policies  practices  interpretations or statutes that places limitations on reimbursement amounts  or changes in reimbursement coding  or practices could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increasing budgetary pressures at both the federal and state level and concerns over escalating costs of health care have led  and may continue to lead  to significant reductions in health care reimbursements 
state concerns over the growth in medicaid also could result in payment reductions 
although governmental payment reductions have not materially affected us in the past  it is possible that such changes in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored health care programs are increasingly shifting to some form of managed care 
some states have recently enacted legislation to require that all medicaid patients be converted to managed care organizations  and similar legislation may be enacted in other states  which could result in reduced payments to us for such patients 
in addition  a state legislated shift in a medicaid plan to managed care could cause the loss of some  or all  medicaid business for us in that state if we were not selected as a participating provider 
additionally  funds received under all health care reimbursement programs are subject to audit with respect to the proper billing for physician services and  accordingly  retroactive adjustments of revenue from these programs could occur 
we expect that there will continue to be proposals to reduce or limit medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
there has been an increasing number of state and federal investigations of hospitals and hospital laboratories  which may increase the likelihood of investigations of our business practices to the extent that we have relationships with the hospitals being investigated 
significant media and public attention has been focused on the health care industry due to ongoing federal and state investigations reportedly related to certain referral and billing practices  laboratory and home health care services and physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals 
most notably  hca is under investigation with respect to such practices 
we operate laboratories on behalf of and have numerous contractual agreements with hospitals  including pathology service contracts with hca hospitals as of december  the government s ongoing investigation of hca could result in a governmental investigation of one or more of our operations that have arrangements with hca 
in addition  the oig and the department of justice have initiated hospital laboratory billing review projects in certain states and are expected to extend such projects to additional states  including states in which we operate hospital laboratories 
these projects increase the likelihood of governmental investigations of laboratories owned and operated by us 
although we monitor our billing practices and hospital arrangements for compliance with prevailing industry practices under applicable laws  such laws are complex and constantly evolving and we cannot assure you that governmental investigators will not take positions that are inconsistent with our practices or industry practices 
the government s investigations of entities with which we contract may have other effects which could materially and adversely affect us  including termination or amendment of one or more of our contracts or the sale of hospitals potentially disrupting the performance of services under such contracts 
in addition  in certain instances indemnity insurers and other non governmental payors have sought repayment from providers  including laboratories  for alleged overpayments 
there has been a heightened scrutiny of medicare and medicaid billing practices in recent years  which may increase our possibility of being subject to costly investigations 
payors periodically reevaluate the services they reimburse 
in some cases  government payors such as medicare also may seek to recoup payments previously made for services determined not to be reimbursable 
any such action by payors would have an adverse affect on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  the federal government has become more aggressive in examining laboratory billing and seeking repayments and penalties as the result of improper billing for services eg  the billing codes used  regardless of whether carriers had furnished clear guidance on this subject 
the primary focus of this initiative has been on hospital laboratories and on routine clinical chemistry tests which comprise only a small portion of our revenues 
although the scope of this initiative could expand  it is not possible to predict whether or in what direction the expansion might occur 
we believe that our practices are proper and do not include any allegedly improper practices now being examined 
however  we cannot assure you that the government will not broaden its initiative to focus on the type of services furnished by us or  if this were to happen  on how much money  if any  we might be required to repay 
furthermore  hipaa and operation restore trust have strengthened the powers of the oig and increased the funding for medicare and medicaid audits and investigations 
as a result  the oig is currently expanding the scope of its health care audits and investigations 
federal and state audits and inspections  whether on a scheduled or unannounced basis  are conducted from time to time at our facilities 
if a negative finding is made as a result of such an investigation  we could be required to change coding practices or repay amounts paid for incorrect practices either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we are dependent on hospital contracts for a significant portion of our revenues  which are short term and can easily be terminated 
our hospital contracts typically have terms of one to five years from their date of execution and automatically renew for additional terms of one year unless otherwise terminated by either party 
the contracts generally provide that the hospital may terminate the agreement prior to the expiration of the initial or any renewal term 
loss of any particular hospital contract would not only result in a loss of net revenue to us  but also a loss of outpatient net revenue that may be derived from the relationship with a hospital and its medical staff 
continuing consolidation in the hospital industry may result in fewer hospitals or fewer laboratories as hospitals move to combine their operations 
as of december   our practices had contracts with hospitals  of which the majority are exclusive  and of which are executed with hca 
we cannot assure you that such contracts with hospitals will not be terminated or that they will be renewed in the future 
if we are unable to make acquisitions in the future  our rate of growth will slow 
much of our historical growth has come from acquisitions  and we expect to continue to pursue growth through the acquisition and development of laboratories 
however  we may be unable to continue to identify and complete suitable acquisitions at prices we are willing to pay or to obtain the necessary financing 
in addition  since we are a bigger company  the amount that acquired businesses contribute to our revenue and profits will likely be smaller on a percentage basis 
we also compete with other companies to identify and complete suitable acquisitions 
we expect this competition to intensify  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
further  the businesses we acquire may not perform well enough to justify our investment 
if we are unable to make additional acquisitions on suitable terms  we may not meet our growth expectations 
our future growth will depend on our ability to secure adequate capital resources and to effectively integrate newly acquired practices 
in addition to acquisitions of and affiliations with practices  we intend to continue to grow through internal expansion 
we derive our net revenue from the net revenue of our practices 
our growth strategy requires i capital investment  ii compliance with present or future laws and regulations that may differ from those to which we are currently subject  iii further development of our corporate management and operational  financial and accounting resources to accommodate and manage growth  and iv the ability to expand our physician and employee base and to train  motivate and manage employees 
failure to meet these requirements could limit our growth potential and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we are taking steps to manage our growth  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so efficiently or that our growth rate will continue in the future 
our expansion into new markets will require us to maintain and establish payor and customer relationships and to convert the patient tracking and financial reporting systems of new practices to our systems 
significant delays or expenses with regard to this process could have a material adverse effect on the integration of additional practices and on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or establish payor and customer relationships  convert management information systems or integrate new practices into our combined network 
the integration of additional practices typically requires the implementation and centralization of purchasing  accounting  human resources  management information systems  cash management and other systems  which may be difficult  costly and time consuming 
our operating results in fiscal quarters immediately following a new practice affiliation may be adversely affected while we attempt to complete the integration process 
we may encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with the future integration of practices into our combined network of affiliated practices 
we cannot assure you that future affiliations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly during the period immediately following completion of such affiliations 
we may inherit significant liabilities from practices that we acquire 
we perform due diligence investigations with respect to potential liabilities of acquired and affiliated practices and obtain indemnification with respect to liabilities from the sellers of such practices 
nevertheless  undiscovered claims may subsequently arise and we cannot assure you that any liabilities for which we become responsible will not be material or will not exceed either the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of the indemnifying parties 
furthermore  through our corporate compliance program  we regularly review each practice s compliance with federal and state health care laws and regulations and revise  as appropriate  the operations  policies and procedures of our practices to conform with our policies and procedures and applicable law 
while we believe that the operations of our practices prior to their acquisition were generally in compliance with such laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that the prior operations of such practices were in full compliance with such laws  as such laws may ultimately be interpreted 
moreover  although we maintain an active compliance program  it is possible that the government might challenge some of our current practices as not being in full compliance with such laws 
a violation of such laws by a practice could result in civil and criminal penalties  exclusion of the physician  the practice or us from participation in medicare and medicaid programs and or loss of a physician s license to practice medicine 
we have significant contingent liabilities payable to many of the sellers of practices that we recently acquired 
in connection with our practice acquisitions  we typically agree to pay to sellers of the practices additional consideration in the form of debt obligations  payment of which is contingent upon the practice achieving certain specified profitability criteria over periods ranging from three to five years from the date of acquisition 
the principal amount and accrued interest of the contingent amount to be paid cannot be determined until the contingency periods terminate and achievement of the profitability criteria is determined 
as of december   if the maximum criteria for the contingency payments with respect to all prior acquisitions were achieved  we would be obligated to make payments  including principal and interest  of approximately million over the next three to five years 
lesser amounts of cash would be paid if the maximum financial criteria are not met 
although we believe that we will be able to make such cash payments from internally generated funds or proceeds of future borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
payments of these contingent amounts will affect our earnings per share and may cause volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we expect to continue to use contingent notes as partial consideration for acquisitions and affiliations 
while we believe that the contingent notes do not violate federal or state anti kickback or self referral statutes  we cannot assure you that that such arrangements will not be challenged by regulatory authorities seeking to enforce such laws 
we have booked a significant amount of intangible assets  which may never be realized 
our acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
net identifiable intangible assets  which include hospital contracts  physician client lists  a management service agreement and laboratory contracts acquired in acquisitions were approximately million at december   representing approximately of our total assets 
net identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
goodwill  which relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired  was approximately million at december   representing approximately of our total assets 
we amortize goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
on an ongoing basis  we make an evaluation  based on undiscounted cash flows  to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the carrying value of intangible assets may no longer be recoverable  in which case an additional charge to earnings may be necessary 
we cannot assure you that we will ever realize the value of our intangible assets 
any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is highly dependent on the recruitment and retention of qualified pathologists 
our business is dependent upon recruiting and retaining pathologists  particularly those with subspecialties  such as dermatopathology 
while our practices have been able to recruit principally through practice acquisitions and retain pathologists  we cannot assure you that we or our practices will be able to continue to do so successfully or on terms similar to our current arrangements 
the relationship between the pathologists and their respective local medical communities is important to the operation and continued profitability of each practice 
in the event that a significant number of pathologists terminate their relationships with our practices or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment  or in the event non compete agreements with a number of physicians were terminated or determined to be invalid or unenforceable  our business  financial condition and results from operation could be materially and adversely affected 
proposals to reform the health care industry may have a material adverse effect on our business 
federal and state governments have recently focused significant attention on health care reform 
it is not possible to predict which  if any  proposal will be adopted 
we cannot assure you that the health care regulatory environment will not change so as to restrict the existing operations of  impose additional requirements on or limit our expansion 
costs of compliance with changes in government regulations may not be subject to recovery through price increases 
some of the proposals under consideration  or others which may be introduced  could  if adopted  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition from other providers of pathology services may adversely affect our business 
our services include the provision of physician practice management services to pathology practices and the provision of pathology and cytology diagnostic services 
competition may result from other anatomic pathology practices  companies in other health care industry segments  such as other hospital based specialties  national clinical laboratories  large physician group practices or pathology physician practice management companies that may enter our markets  some of which may have greater financial and other resources than us 
we compete with several companies  and such competition can reasonably be expected to increase 
in addition  companies in other health care segments  such as hospitals  national clinical laboratories  third party payors  and health maintenance organizations  many of which have greater financial resources than us  may become competition in the employment and management of pathology practices 
we compete for acquisitions and affiliations on the basis of our reputation  management experience  status and resources as a public company and our focus on anatomic pathology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively or that additional competitors will not enter our markets or make it more difficult for us to acquire or affiliate with practices on favorable terms 
we may be subject to significant professional liability claims and we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage limits will be sufficient to cover such claims 
our business entails an inherent risk of claims of physician professional liability for acts or omissions of our physicians and laboratory personnel 
we and our physicians periodically become involved as defendants in medical malpractice lawsuits  some of which are currently ongoing  and are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards 
we have consolidated our physician professional liability insurance coverages with the st 
paul fire and marine insurance company  whereby each of the pathologists is insured under claims made policies with primary limits of million per occurrence and million in the annual aggregate  and share with us in surplus coverage of up to million in the aggregate 
the policy also provides prior acts coverage for each of our physicians with respect to our practices prior to their acquisition by us 
further  we have provided reserves for incurred but not reported claims in connection with our claims made policies 
the terms of the purchase agreements relating to each practice acquisition contain certain limited rights of indemnification from the sellers of the practices 
we also maintain property and umbrella liability insurance policies 
while we believe that we have adequate professional liability insurance coverage  we can give no assurances that a future claim or claims will not be successful and  if successful  will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage or that such coverage will continue to be available at acceptable costs or on favorable terms 
in addition  our insurance does not cover all potential liabilities arising from governmental fines and penalties  indemnification agreements and certain other uninsurable losses 
a malpractice claim asserted against us  a management subsidiary  a practice subsidiary  an affiliated practice or an affiliated physician could  in the event of an adverse outcome exceeding limits of available insurance coverage  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the continued growth of managed care may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future 
entities providing managed care coverage have been successful in reducing payments for medical services in numerous ways  including entering into arrangements under which payments to a service provider are capitated  limiting testing to specified procedures  denying payment for specified services unless prior authorization for such services has been obtained and refusing to increase fees for specified services 
the continued growth of the managed care industry and its continued success in reducing payments to medical service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we could be damaged by the loss of our key personnel 
our success is dependent upon the efforts and abilities of our key management personnel  particularly james c 
new  our chairman and chief executive officer  brian c 
carr  our president  gregory a 
marsh  our vice president and chief financial officer  alan levin  md  our chief operating officer and dennis m 
smith  jr  md  our senior vice president and medical director 
the loss of service of any of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the complex nature of our billing and reimbursement arrangements  we may be at a greater risk of internal revenue service examinations 
the internal revenue service  or irs  conducted an examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years ended december  and and concluded that no changes to the tax reported needed to be made 
although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable irs rules and regulations  if the irs should determine that we are not in compliance in any other years  it could have a material adverse effect on the our financial position and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile and the value of your investment may decrease  for various reasons including reasons that are unrelated to the performance of our business 
there has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of health care companies that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
in fact  our common stock  which trades on the nasdaq national market  has traded from a low of per share to a high of per share for the year ended december  we believe that various factors  such as legislative and regulatory developments  quarterly variations in our actual or anticipated results of operations  lower revenues or earnings than those anticipated by securities analysts  the overall economy and the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws and preferred share purchase rights plan may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in its best interest 
any of these anti takeover provisions could lower the value of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated principally with changes in interest rates 
interest rate exposure is principally limited to the revolving loan of million at december  in may  the company entered into three interest rate swaps transactions with an effective date of october   variable maturity dates  and a combined notional amount of million 
these interest rate swap transactions involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received is accrued and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are indexed to day libor 
the following table summarizes the terms of the swaps notional amount in millions fixed rate term in months maturity the fixed rates do not include the credit spread which is currently 
the fixed rates under the new agreements are approximately higher than the prior agreements reflecting the numerous interest rate increases by the federal reserve since october and the current interest rate environment 
beginning in october  these higher fixed rates will increase the company s annual interest cost by approximately million 
in addition  further tightening of interest rates by the federal reserve will increase the company s interest cost on the outstanding balance of the credit facility not subject to interest rate protection 
all of the company s swap transactions involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received is accrued and is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate volatility and associated risks arising from the floating rate structure of its credit facility and are not held or issued for trading purposes 
the company is required by the terms of its credit facility to keep some form of interest rate protection in place
