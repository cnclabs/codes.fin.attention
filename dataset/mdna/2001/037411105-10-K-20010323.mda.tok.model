debt as a percentage of total capitalization declined to percent from percent at the end of  despite outlays for acquisitions and exploration and development activities exceeding billion during apache is one of only two independent oil and gas companies with a single a rating from both moody s and standard poor s rating agencies 
following are several performance achievements for the year driven by the company s acquisition and exploitation strategy  oil and natural gas production averaged mbbls of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day for the year  percent and percent higher  respectively  than s record production rates 
the company added mmboe to its proved reserves through acquisitions  drilling and revisions at a worldwide finding cost of per boe 
the percent increase in proved reserves enabled proved reserves to cross the one billion boe mark  transforming apache into a larger  stronger and more profitable company 
oil and gas production revenues more than doubled to billion from billion in surging oil and natural gas prices contributed million and million  respectively  to the increase in revenues  with production growth accounting for the remainder 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion increased percent from record levels in income attributable to common stock of million  nearly quadrupled s record 
this equates to a percent return on average shareholders equity

china in june  the company s subsidiary  apache china  filed a lawsuit against petrochina  china national petroleum corporation and china national oil and gas exploration and development corporation in connection with certain of the company s chinese operations in the zhao dong block of the bohai bay in china 
the company filed seeking damages and injunctive relief to prevent the chinese parties from declaring that apache and xcl china  ltd 
had relinquished some of the company s chinese exploratory acreage  and other claims 
the lawsuit was filed in the us bankruptcy court in opelousas  louisiana  in connection with bankruptcy proceedings of xcl china  ltd  a co owner in the zhao dong block 
on june   apache and petrochina announced having reached agreement to resolve the outstanding issues associated with development of the zhao dong block 
the agreement called for petrochina and the china national petroleum corporation to obtain various governmental approvals including approval of the overall development plan 
by the middle of february  all of the agreed actions had occurred  including all of the required governmental approvals  and apache china s lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice 
apache and the other participants in the zhao dong block are preparing to begin the construction of production facilities and development drilling in accordance with the approved overall development plan 
future trends apache s strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves  production  cash flow and earnings through a balanced growth program that involves exploiting our existing asset base  acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value  and investing in high potential exploration prospects 
exploiting existing asset base apache seeks to maximize the value of our existing asset base by increasing production and reserves while reducing operating costs per unit 
in order to achieve these objectives  we rigorously pursue production enhancement opportunities such as workovers  recompletions  and moderate risk drilling  while divesting marginal and non strategic properties and other activities to reduce costs 
given the large number of transactions completed over the last two years  apache s inventory of exploitation opportunities has never been larger as evidenced by our billion capital plan for year  which is largely directed at exploitation activity 
acquiring properties to which we can add incremental value apache seeks to purchase reserves at appropriate prices by generally avoiding auction processes where we are competing against other buyers 
our aim is to follow each acquisition with a cycle of reserve enhancement  property consolidation and cash flow acceleration  facilitating asset growth and debt reduction 
in general  recent high prices and apache s reputation for getting deals done  have created more opportunities to negotiate for properties than was the case several years ago 
transactions made throughout coupled with those scheduled to close in the first half of assure that apache will achieve its th consecutive year of production growth at a time that indicated product prices for the year are strong 
investing in high potential exploration prospects apache seeks to concentrate our exploratory investments in a select number of international areas and to become the dominant operator in those regions 
we believe that these investments  although higher risk  offer potential for attractive investment returns and significant reserve additions 
our international investments and exploration activities are a significant component of our long term growth strategy 
they complement our north american operations  which are more development oriented 
a critical component in implementing our three pronged growth strategy is maintenance of significant financial flexibility 
apache s recent senior unsecured long term debt upgrades by moody s and standard poor s illustrate our commitment to preserving a strong balance sheet and gives us a solid foundation and competitive advantage with which to pursue our growth initiatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to its united states and canadian natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company periodically enters into hedging activities on a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
in  apache recognized a net loss of million from hedging activities that decreased oil and gas production revenues 
this includes losses of million in derivatives and million from fixed price physical gas contracts 
gains or losses on derivative contracts are expected to continue to be offset by sales at the spot market price or to preserve the margin on existing physical gas contracts 
at december   the company had open natural gas price swap positions with a positive fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would increase the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in prices would decrease the fair value by million 
the company also had open oil price swap positions at december  with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil prices would change the fair value by million 
a percent decrease in oil prices would change the fair value by million 
discount rates used in arriving at fair values range from percent for to percent for at december   the company also had natural gas commodity collars with a fair value of million and oil commodity collars with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by million and million  respectively 
a percent decrease in oil and gas prices would change the fair values of the gas collars and the oil collars by million and million  respectively 
the model used to arrive at the fair values for the commodity collars is based on the black commodity pricing model 
changes in fair value  assuming percent price changes  assume non constant volatility with volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  notional volumes associated with the company s derivative contracts are shown in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company considers its interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on approximately percent of the company s debt 
at december   total debt included million of floating rate debt 
as a result  apache s annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates on approximately percent of its total debt outstanding at december  the impact on annual cash flow of a percent change in the floating rate approximately basis points would be approximately million 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  foreign currency risk the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
australian gas production is sold under fixed price australian dollar contracts and over half the costs incurred are paid in australian dollars 
revenue and disbursement transactions denominated in australian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
reported cash flow relating to canadian operations is based on cash flows measured in canadian dollars converted to the us dollar equivalent based on the average of the canadian and us dollar exchange rates for the period reported 
substantially all of the company s international transactions  outside of canada and australia  are denominated in us dollars 
the company s polish and australian subsidiaries have net financial assets that are denominated in a currency other than the functional reporting currency of the subsidiaries 
a decrease in value of percent in the australian dollar and polish zloty relative to the us dollar from the year end exchange rates would result in a foreign currency loss of approximately million  based on december  amounts 
the company considers its current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
although apache makes use of futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to mitigate risk  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
