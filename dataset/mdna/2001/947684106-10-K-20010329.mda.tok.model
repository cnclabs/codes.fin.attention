item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
see factors affecting our operating results regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we provide employee internet management  or eim  solutions that enable businesses to monitor  report and manage how their employees use the internet 
our websense enterprise solution supports an organization s efforts to improve employee productivity  conserve network bandwidth and mitigate potential legal liability 
we were founded in as netpartners internet solutions  a reseller of computer network security solutions and related services 
in  we released our first software product  websense internet screening system 
since that time  we have refocused our business on developing and selling employee internet management solutions  and no longer focus on software resale and service business 
in  we changed our name to websense  inc and completed our change in business strategy 
in the same year  we expanded our senior management team  raised approximately million in a private round of financing and further strengthened indirect sales channels and business relationships 
in december  we released version a redesigned version of websense enterprise  our most recent version was released in october we currently derive a substantial majority of our revenues from subscriptions to this solution and expect this trend to continue in the future 
when a purchase decision is made  customers enter into a subscription agreement  which is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of users 
upon entering into the subscription agreement  we promptly invoice customers for their subscriptions 
generally  payment is due for the full term of the subscription within days of the invoice 
we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the subscription agreement 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
upon expiration of the subscription  customers who wish to resubscribe must do so at our then current rates to continue using websense enterprise 
our revenue is significantly influenced by subscription renewals  and a decrease in subscription renewals could negatively impact our revenue 
we also derive revenues from professional services for the implementation of our products and from resale of hardware and software 
we recognize revenues for these services and products upon their completion or delivery 
these revenues declined significantly in due to the shift in business strategy 
we expect these revenues to continue to decline as a percent of total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in  we derived of revenues from international sales compared to in we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european and asia pacific markets  because we believe international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
we currently sell websense enterprise through indirect approximately of subscription revenue and direct approximately of subscription revenue channels  however  our strategy is to increasingly rely on indirect sales channels 
domestically  we sell solutions through more than value added resellers  or vars  and through our direct sales force 
internationally  we distribute websense enterprise through more than distributors and resellers in over countries who resell our solution through vars and their resellers 
in addition  we leverage the sales and marketing capabilities of the original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and other key providers of complementary hardware and software products 
because we derive revenues from subscription fees  we do not recognize the entire amount of subscription fees received in the month the subscription agreements are executed 
however  we recognize operating expenses as they are incurred 
operating expenses have continued to increase as compared to prior periods due to expanded selling and marketing efforts and investments in administrative infrastructure to support subscription sales that we will recognize as revenue in subsequent periods 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues subscriptions other products and services total revenues cost of revenues subscriptions other products and services total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net net loss years ended december  and revenues subscriptions 
subscription revenue increased from million in to million in this increase of million was primarily a result of the addition of new customers approximately million during as well as renewals by existing customers approximately million 
subscription revenue accounted for of total revenues in compared to in the increase as a percentage of sales is due to our focus on selling websense enterprise 
other products and services 
other products and services revenue  which include revenues from professional services and from the resale of computers and firewall software  decreased from million in to  in other products and services revenue accounted for of revenues in compared to in the decrease as a percentage of sales in is consistent with the strategy that has transformed websense from a network security service organization and reseller of third party security software to a provider of subscription based employee internet management products 
cost of revenues cost of subscriptions 
cost of subscriptions consists of the costs of web site review  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our database 
cost of subscriptions increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to additional technical support personnel and the development of automation tools by our database group  as well as increased allocated facilities and human resource costs in cost of subscriptions as a percentage of subscription revenue decreased to in from in this decrease in costs of subscription revenue as a percentage of subscription revenue was due to increased revenue and the relative fixed nature of these costs 
cost of other products and services 
cost of other products and services consists primarily of the cost of resale software and related hardware 
cost of other products and services decreased from million in to  in the costs have decreased as a result of the shift in focus away from reselling hardware and software 
cost of other products and services as a percentage of other products and services revenue increased to in compared to in primarily due to lower volume discounts on the firewall software and hardware that we resold 
gross margin gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase was due to a higher percentage mix of subscription revenues  which generate a higher margin as compared to other products and services 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  along with costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the million increase in selling and marketing expenses in was primarily due to increased headcount costs of million  increases in advertising and promotional costs of million  increased travel costs of  and increased allocations of information technology  facilities and human resource costs of million 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase as we add personnel to expand our selling and marketing efforts 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers  contract programmers  facilities costs and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase of million in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased headcount of million and increased allocations of information technology  facilities and human resource costs of million 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in the  decrease in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to the expanded allocation of information technology  facilities and human resource costs to other departments of  and to non recurring charges in the first quarter of which consisted of an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of  partially offset by increased costs related to being a public company of  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future  reflecting growth in operations and increased expenses associated with being a public company amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation increased from million in to million in there was no amortization of stock based compensation in periods prior to the increase in the amortization expense in is primarily due to the large number of option grants that occurred after march for which deferred compensation was recorded as well as deferred compensation recorded for options issued in the first quarter of interest income  net net interest income increased from  in to million in this increase reflects an increase in interest income generated from higher average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in  which included the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in march years ended december  and revenues subscriptions 
subscription revenue increased from million in to million in this increase of million was primarily a result of a focus on the sale of our websense enterprise products in  which resulted in the addition of new customers accounting for approximately million of the increase as well as renewals by existing customers accounting for approximately million of the increase 
subscription revenue accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in other products and services 
other products and services revenue decreased from million in to million in other products and services revenue accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in the decrease as a percentage of sales in is consistent with the strategy that has transformed websense from a network security service organization and reseller of third party security software to a provider of subscription based employee internet management products 
cost of revenues cost of subscriptions 
cost of subscriptions increased from  in to million in cost of subscriptions as a percentage of subscription revenue was in and in this decrease in cost of subscriptions as a percentage of subscription revenue was due to increased revenue and the relatively fixed nature of these costs 
cost of other products and services 
cost of other products and services decreased from million in to million in the costs decreased as a result of the shift in focus away from reselling hardware and software 
cost of other products and services as a percentage of other products and services revenue was in and in this percentage decrease was due primarily to decreased sales of low margin hardware products 
gross margin gross margin increased from million in to million in the increase was due to a higher percentage mix of subscription revenues  which generate a higher margin as compared to other products and services 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million in was primarily due to increases in headcount of million and promotional expenses of  and was partially offset by a decrease in advertising expenses of  research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in research and development expenses was primarily a result of increased development efforts and enhancements to websense enterprise 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to significant investments in increased headcount of million  facilities of  and information technology of  to support an expansion in the scope of our business amortization of stock based compensation 
there was no amortization of stock based compensation in periods prior to interest income  net net interest income 
net interest income increased from  in to  in the increase in resulted primarily from the investment of proceeds from our series b convertible preferred stock financing in liquidity and capital resources from our inception through march  we financed our operations primarily through the sale of preferred equity securities 
in total  we raised approximately million  net of fees and expenses  through the sale of preferred equity securities 
in march  we closed our initial public offering with proceeds  net of underwriting fees and offering expenses  of approximately million 
in the past  we have also utilized available financing for the purchase of capital equipment 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investments in marketable securities of million and an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of  in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in is primarily due to interest earnings on our cash invested and an increase in our subscriptions which are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
in and  cash used in operations was primarily the result of our net losses and increases in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and  in the relative increase in cash used in investing activities in is primarily due to purchases of marketable securities using proceeds of our initial public offering in march in and  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures  related to our investments in computer equipment and facilities  which were required to support our business expansion 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the completion in march of our initial public offering  reduced by million of repayments of our outstanding equipment financing notes payable in the second quarter of in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million received from the sale of series b convertible preferred stock and million in proceeds from borrowings 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of million received from the sale of series a convertible preferred stock  reduced by repayments of notes payable 
in june we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank for a credit facility of million 
at december  we had million available for drawing under this facility and  set aside for existing or future letters of credit 
we have operating lease commitments of million expiring at various dates through august we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  investments in marketable securities and funds available under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
if existing cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a larger credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
summarized quarterly data unaudited the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information  for the eight quarters ended december  we believe this information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

see note of notes to the financial statements for an explanation of the determination of basic and diluted net loss per share 
factors affecting our operating results you should carefully consider the following information in addition to the other information in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material and that we believe are specific to our company 
if any of these or other risks actually occur  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have a history of losses and  because we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future  we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have experienced net losses in each of the last fiscal quarters  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we may continue to incur significant net losses in the future and may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability unless our revenues increase at a greater rate than our operating expenses 
we currently expect our operating expenses to increase substantially  as we  among other things expand our websense product offerings  expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  increase our research and development efforts to upgrade our existing products and develop new products and technologies  develop and expand our proprietary database and systems  upgrade our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  and hire additional personnel  including additional engineers and other technical staff 
we will need to significantly increase our revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we fail to increase revenues from subscription fees for websense enterprise  we will continue to experience losses indefinitely 
we also may fail to accurately estimate and assess our increased operating expenses as we grow 
if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  our financial performance will be adversely affected  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we are an early stage company with an unproven business model  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
we have only a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our current business and future prospects 
we began offering our employee internet management software in september  but only since may  when we released our first version of websense enterprise as a significant enhancement to our original product  have we directed a majority of our focus on this market 
we introduced the most recent version of websense enterprise in october as a result  the revenue and income potential of our business and our market are unproven 
in addition  we have very limited historical data with respect to subscription renewals because we sell subscriptions that range from one to three years in length and have only been selling websense enterprise for less than three and one half years 
further  because of our limited operating history and because the market for employee internet management products is relatively new and rapidly evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business 
before investing  you should consider an investment in our stock in light of the risks  uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as ours 
we may not be able to successfully address any or all of these risks 
failure to adequately do so could cause our business  results of operations and financial condition to suffer 
because we expect to derive substantially all of our future revenue from subscription fees for websense enterprise  any failure of this product to satisfy customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance will seriously harm our business 
substantially all of our revenues come from subscriptions for websense enterprise  and we expect this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
subscription revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december   of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  as a result  if for any reason revenues from websense enterprise decline or do not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  our operating results and our business will be significantly impaired 
if websense enterprise fails to meet the needs of our target customers  or if it does not compare favorably in price and performance to competing products  our growth will be limited 
we cannot assure you that websense enterprise will achieve continued market acceptance 
our future financial performance also will depend  in part  on our ability to diversify our offerings by successfully developing  introducing and gaining customer acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of websense enterprise 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in achieving market acceptance of any new products that we develop or of enhanced versions of websense enterprise 
any failure or delay in diversifying our existing offerings could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the market for employee internet management products is emerging  and if we are not successful in promoting awareness of the need for websense enterprise and of our websense brand  our growth may be limited 
based on our experience with potential customers  we believe that many corporations are unaware of the existence or scope of problems caused by employee misuse of the internet 
in addition  there may be a time limited opportunity to achieve and maintain a significant share of the market for employee internet management products due in part to the emerging nature of this market and the substantial resources available to our existing and potential competitors 
we spent approximately million of our marketing communications resources in to promote awareness of the problems caused by employee misuse of internet access in the workplace  but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this effort 
if employers do not recognize or acknowledge these problems  then the market for websense enterprise may develop more slowly than we expect  which could adversely affect our operating results 
developing and maintaining awareness of our websense brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future employee internet management products 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops 
successful promotion of our websense brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to develop reliable and useful products at competitive prices 
if we fail to successfully promote our websense brand  or if our expenses to promote and maintain our websense brand are greater than anticipated  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
our future growth depends on our existing customers renewing and purchasing additional subscriptions to websense enterprise 
our future success depends on achieving substantial revenue from customer renewals for subscriptions to websense enterprise 
subscriptions for websense enterprise typically have a duration of  or months 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration 
we cannot assure you that we will generate significant revenue from renewals 
in order to maintain our revenues we must continue to sell renewal subscriptions 
our future success also depends on our ability to sell subscriptions to existing customers for additional employees within their respective organizations 
we believe that approximately of our customers employees are covered by websense enterprise 
as a result  to increase our revenues we must sell our existing customers additional subscriptions for websense enterprise to get greater coverage of their workforces 
this may require increasingly sophisticated sales efforts targeting senior management and other management personnel associated with our customers internet infrastructure 
because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for websense enterprise ratably over the term of the subscription  downturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our revenues 
we expect that a substantial majority of our future revenues will come from subscriptions to websense enterprise 
upon execution of a subscription agreement  we invoice our customers for the full term of the subscription agreement 
we then recognize revenue from customers over the terms of their subscription agreements which generally have a duration of  or months 
as a result  a majority of revenues we recognize in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into and paid for during previous quarters 
because of this deferred revenue  the revenues we report in any quarter or series of quarters may mask significant downturns in sales and the market acceptance of websense enterprise 
we may not be able to develop acceptable new products or enhancements to our existing products at a rate required by our rapidly changing market 
our future success depends on our ability to develop new products or enhancements to our existing products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and that address the changing needs of our customers 
although websense enterprise is designed to operate with a variety of network hardware and software platforms  we will need to continuously modify and enhance websense enterprise to keep pace with changes in internet related hardware  software  communication  browser and database technologies 
we may not be successful in either developing such products or timely introducing them to the market 
in addition  uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies  or modifications to existing platforms or technologies  could increase our research and development expenses 
the failure of our products to operate effectively with the existing and future network platforms and technologies will limit or reduce the market for our products  result in customer dissatisfaction and seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we must develop and expand our indirect sales channels to increase revenue and improve our operating results 
we currently sell our products both indirectly and directly  however  we intend to rely increasingly on our indirect sales channels 
we depend on our indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  distributors  original equipment manufacturers and internet service providers  to offer websense enterprise to a larger customer base than we can reach through our direct sales efforts 
we will need to expand our existing relationships and enter into new relationships to increase our current and future market share and revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships  or that any new relationships will be available on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our existing relationships or enter into new relationships  we would lose customer introductions and co marketing benefits and our operating results could suffer 
our reliance on indirect sales channels could result in reduced revenue growth because we have little control over our value added resellers  distributors and original equipment manufacturers 
our indirect sales channels accounted for approximately of our subscription revenues in and in we anticipate that sales from our various indirect sales channels  including value added resellers  distributors  original equipment manufacturers  internet service providers and others  will account for an increasing percentage of our total revenues in future periods 
none of these parties is obligated to continue selling our products or to make any purchases from us 
our ability to generate increased revenue depends significantly upon the ability and willingness of our indirect sales channels to market and sell our products to organizations worldwide 
if they are unsuccessful in their efforts  our operating results will suffer 
we cannot control the level of effort these parties expend or the extent to which any of them will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
many of our indirect sales channels also market and sell products that compete with websense enterprise 
we may not be able to prevent these parties from devoting greater resources to support our competitors products 
we face increasing competition from better established companies that may have significantly greater resources  which could prevent us from increasing revenue or achieving profitability 
the market for our products is intensely competitive and is likely to become even more so in the future 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced sales  reduced margins or the failure of websense enterprise to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our current principal competitors include companies offering network filtering products  such as surfcontrol  secure computing  symantec and nh  companies offering network reporting products  such as telemate 
net and webtrends  and companies offering client based software filtering products  such as e we also face current and potential competition from vendors of internet servers  operating systems and networking hardware  many of which now  or may in the future  develop and or bundle employee internet management products with their products 
we also compete against  and expect increased competition from  traditional network management software developers and web management service providers 
many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  such as greater name recognition and larger marketing budgets and resources  established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical and other resources 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
for all of the foregoing reasons  we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
other vendors may develop products similar to ours for incorporation into their hardware or software  and thereby reduce demand for websense enterprise 
in the future  vendors of internet related hardware and software may enhance their products or develop separate products that include functions that are currently provided by websense enterprise 
if employee internet management functions become standard features of internet related hardware or software  the demand for websense enterprise will decrease 
furthermore  even if websense enterprise provides greater functionality and is more effective than the products offered by vendors of internet related hardware or software  potential customers might accept this limited functionality in lieu of purchasing our websense enterprise 
sales to customers outside the united states have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue  and we expect this trend to continue  which exposes us to risks inherent in international sales 
we market and sell our products outside the united states through value added resellers  distributors and other resellers 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenues in and in as a key component of our business strategy  we intend to expand our international sales 
in addition to the risks associated with our domestic sales  our international sales are subject to the following risks dependence on foreign distributors and their sales channels  the ability of our websense enterprise products to properly categorize and filter web sites containing foreign languages  laws and business practices favoring foreign competitors  compliance with multiple  conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations  including tax laws and regulations  foreign currency fluctuations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties  and regional economic and political conditions 
such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future international sales 
any reduction in international sales  or our failure to further develop our international distribution channels  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our international revenue is currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies may make websense enterprise more expensive for international customers  which could harm our business 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation 
negative economic conditions in the united states and in the other countries and geographic areas in which we offer our products may negatively impact our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have seen a rapid and increasingly severe economic downturn in the united states and in the other international markets in which we offer our products in the first quarter of this downturn may impact our ability to reach profitability by negatively affecting growth in demand for our products and services  causing some of our customers to be unable to pay for subscriptions they have ordered  and decreasing the renewal rate of subscriptions by our existing customers 
in addition  the economic downturn may force companies to prioritize expenditures and we cannot be sure that subscriptions to our products will be seen as necessary expenditures in a slowing economy 
there can be no certainty as to the degree or severity of the duration of this downturn 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing  of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and in other countries and geographic regions in which we conduct our business 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future  which funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially over at least the next months 
in addition  we may experience a material decrease in liquidity due to unforeseen capital requirements or other events and uncertainties 
as a result  we may need to raise additional funds  and such funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our software applications or database  execute on our business plan  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
this may seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may seek to raise additional funds  and additional funding may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions 
an additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants  which may limit our operating flexibility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders will be reduced 
these stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share and any additional equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
our common stock may not develop an active  liquid trading market 
we completed our initial public offering in march prior to this offering  there was no public market for our common stock 
we cannot predict whether an active trading market in our common stock will develop or how liquid that market may become 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and these fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past  and will likely vary in the future as the result of fluctuations in our operating expenses 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the future as we expand our selling and marketing activities  increase our research and development efforts and hire additional personnel 
in addition  our operating expenses historically have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as the result of the factors described below and elsewhere in this annual report concentration of marketing expenses for activities such as trade shows and advertising campaigns  a concentration of general and administrative expenses  such as recruiting expenses and professional services fees  and a concentration of research and development costs 
as a result  it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of current or potential investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control  including announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors  demand for websense enterprise  including fluctuations in subscription renewals  fluctuations in revenues from our indirect sales channels  changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  and changes in government regulations 
in addition  the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us  changes in our pricing policies  quarterly variations in our operating expenses  and our technological capabilities to accommodate the future growth in our operations or our customers 
further  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price of the stock of many internet related companies  and that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
a number of publicly traded internet related companies have current market prices below their initial public offering prices 
market fluctuations such as these may seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action suits have been filed following periods of market volatility in the price of a company s securities 
if such an action was instituted  we would incur substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
future sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by our existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
our database categories and our process for classifying web sites within those categories are subjective  and we may not be able to categorize web sites in accordance with our customers expectations 
we may not succeed in accurately categorizing internet content to meet our customers expectations 
we rely upon a combination of automated filtering technology and human review to categorize web sites in our proprietary database 
our customers may not agree with our determinations that particular web sites should be included or not included in specific categories of our database 
in addition  it is possible that our filtering processes may place objectionable material in categories that are generally unrestricted by our users internet access policies  which could result in employees having access to such material in the workplace 
any miscategorization could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation 
furthermore  we select our categories based on web site content we believe employers want to manage 
we may not now  or in the future  succeed in properly identifying the categories of web site content that employers want to manage 
any failure to effectively categorize and filter web sites according to our customers expectations will impair the growth of our business and our efforts to increase brand acceptance 
our database may fail to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet 
the success of websense enterprise depends on the breadth and accuracy of our database 
although our database currently catalogs more than million web sites  it contains only a fraction of the material available on the internet 
in addition  the total number of web sites is growing rapidly  and we expect this rapid growth rate to continue in the future 
we cannot assure you that our database and database technologies will be able to keep pace with the growth in the number of web sites  especially the growing number of web sites containing foreign languages 
further  the ongoing evolution of the internet will require us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our database 
because websense enterprise can only manage access to web sites included in our database  if our database does not contain a meaningful portion of relevant web sites  the effectiveness of websense enterprise will be significantly diminished 
any failure of our database to keep pace with the rapid growth and technological change of the internet will impair the market acceptance of websense enterprise  which in turn will harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and establish our websense brand 
intellectual property is critical to our success  and we rely upon trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our websense brand 
any of our trademarks may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
we currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available 
the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as united states laws  and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary technology and brands will be adequate 
furthermore  despite our efforts  we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 
any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
our technologies and products may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  and could divert management attention from executing our business plan 
our systems may be vulnerable to security risks or service disruptions that could harm our business 
our servers are vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins and service disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to process customer requests 
such events could be very expensive to remedy  could damage our reputation and could discourage existing and potential customers from using our products 
we may experience break ins in the future 
any such events could substantially harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because our products are complex and are deployed in a wide variety of complex network environments  they may have errors or defects that users identify after deployment  which could harm our reputation and our business 
products as complex as ours frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
we have from time to time found errors in versions of websense enterprise  and we may find such errors in the future 
the occurrence of errors could adversely affect sales of our products  divert the attention of engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
evolving regulation of the internet may affect us adversely 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
such regulation is likely in the areas of user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services 
taxation of internet use or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection or processing of personal or consumer information could affect our activities 
furthermore  any regulation imposing fees for internet use could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet commerce  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the internet as a business tool 
expansion in the sales of websense enterprise depends on the continued acceptance of the internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial medium due to inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development of complementary products  such as high speed modems 
additionally  the internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity  security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  and quality of service 
if the internet does not continue to become a widespread communications medium and commercial platform  the demand for websense enterprise could be significantly reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products create risks of potential negative publicity and legal liability 
because customers rely on websense enterprise to provide employee internet management  any significant defects or errors in our products may result in negative publicity or legal claims 
negative publicity or legal claims could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  websense enterprise s capability to report internet data retrieval requests and the workstations from which they originated may result in negative publicity or legal claims based on potential privacy violations 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and development personnel 
in particular  we rely on john b 
carrington  our president  chief executive officer and chairman 
we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing engineering personnel because of the complexity of our products and technologies 
we do not have employment agreements with a majority of our executive officers  key management or development personnel and  therefore  they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that in such an event we would be able to recruit personnel to replace these individuals in a timely manner  or at all  on acceptable terms 
our recent growth has strained our existing personnel and infrastructure resources  and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth  we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
we are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our operations  which has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our future success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively 
this will require us to hire and train additional personnel to manage our expanding operations 
in addition  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures 
if we fail to successfully manage our growth  we will be unable to execute our business plan 
because competition for our target employees is intense  we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 
to execute our growth plan  we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we need to hire additional personnel in virtually all operational areas  including selling and marketing  research and development  operations and technical support  customer service and administration 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet related products 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 
if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel  our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 
if we acquire any companies or technologies in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies in the future 
we have not made any acquisitions or investments to date  and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  services and personnel  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  risk of entering new markets  potential loss of key employees  and inability to generate sufficient revenues to offset acquisition or investment costs 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities  our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders own a large percentage of our voting stock and could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control or other matters requiring stockholder approval  even if favored by our other stockholders 
as of december  our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders  and their respective affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to control substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of all directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as some provisions of delaware law  may discourage  delay or prevent third parties from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
it also provides that stockholders may not fill board vacancies  call stockholder meetings or act by written consent 
our bylaws further provide that advance written notice is required prior to stockholder proposals 
each of these provisions makes it more difficult for stockholders to obtain control of our board or initiate actions that are opposed by the then current board 
additionally  we have authorized preferred stock that is undesignated  making it possible for the board to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights and preferences that could impede the success of any attempted change of control 
delaware law also could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of the shares of common stock held by our stockholders we do not intend to pay dividends 
since we terminated our election to be treated as an s corporation in january  we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future cash flows from operations to fund growth and  therefore  do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and mortgage backed securities 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million loan and security agreement with a financial institution 
interest on this credit facility was at december  at december  we had no advances outstanding under this credit facility 
if we were to draw advances under this facility  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense we would pay and could  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
