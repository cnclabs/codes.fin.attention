the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
business segments operating segments are organized internally primarily by the type of products produced and markets served  and in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has aggregated similar operating segments into two reportable segments flow control products and engineered components 
the flow control products segment is a supplier of copper and brass plumbing fittings for the industrial  commercial  and residential construction markets  and cast and fabricated metal products for sale to original equipment manufacturers in the transportation  construction  air conditioning  and refrigeration industries 
the engineered components segment is a supplier of aluminum wheels and aluminum components  primarily for automotive original equipment manufacturers 
during  the company reevaluated the composition of the reportable segments and reclassified one business from engineered components to flow control products 
prior year segment information was restated to conform to the presentation 
acquisitions and divestitures during and the company completed transactions that impact the company s financial results for those years and affect the comparison between   and in october  the company sold superior valve company superior for  in cash 
the transaction resulted in a pretax gain of  results for included sales for superior valve of approximately  in the company s flow control segment 
effective june   the company purchased the remaining share in ctc  from izumi industries  ltd  bringing total ownership to 
the purchase price was approximately  of which  is payable in annual installments over the next five years 
no goodwill was recognized from the transaction 
the financial results of ctc are included as part of the engineered components segment in the consolidated financial statements since the purchase of the remaining share 
unusual items in october  the company announced that it had hired financial advisors to assist the company in exploring strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value 
this process included evaluating the possible sale of the business  various business combinations  and several break up scenarios 
during  the company incurred unusually high expenditures for legal and other professional fees in conjunction with the strategic alternative review 
after careful consideration  in early february  the company s board of directors reached a decision that  even in the currently weakened market environment  a stronger pursuit of the company s fundamental strategy would  over the long term  better serve the shareholders and concluded the review of strategic alternatives 
at the same time  the company s board of directors made several senior management changes that would provide the leadership needed to move the company forward which resulted in additional expense for severance and related costs 
due to operating losses incurred during the second quarter  at march   the company was not in compliance with certain non monetary covenants under its credit agreement the revolver agreement 
this resulted in a cross violation in the company s senior note agreement the senior notes and the casting technology credit agreement the ctc agreement of which the company had guaranteed  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources  the company has entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement  and at the same time  received waivers of the covenant violations under the revolver agreement  senior notes  and the ctc agreement through april  the company incurred significant costs related to obtaining the credit agreement and the waivers 
in the last half of fiscal  the new management of the company initiated a strategic review of the company in light of its weak markets and relatively poor operating performance 
as a result  management decided to dispose of certain under utilized machinery  tooling and equipment  to scrap certain slow moving inventories  and to increase the allowance for doubtful and disputed receivables 
in addition to establishing reserves for these items  the unusual items also included increases in workers compensation and certain other reserves for previously closed facilities  increases in environmental reserves  and other accrual adjustments 
additionally  due to past operating results at the company s european operations  in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company increased its valuation allowance against certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
these unusual items totaled   net of tax 
in addition  the company s share of ctc s unusual charges prior to june   which are included in other income and expense  was   net of tax 
management of the company does not anticipate that there will be any significant additional charges of this nature in the near future 
results of operations consolidated net sales in were  which represented a  or  decrease from consolidated net sales in were  which represented a  or  increase over the following table shows the components of the changes in the company s consolidated net sales 
volume price and product mix acquisitions and divestitures foreign currency exchange rates total sales growth in  consolidated net sales decreased to  the volume decline experienced in reflects decreased automotive production in north america during  auto manufacturer s new model launch delays in europe  and a slowness in construction markets for a portion of the year 
north american light vehicle production was down year over year while us light vehicle sales were down during the same period 
the impact of a favorable product mix  primarily at the company s european operations  helped negate the unfavorable pricing that resulted from competitive market pricing issues encountered in the flow control products segment 
the inclusion of ctc for the fourth quarter increased sales while a weaker italian lira caused a decrease in sales from the prior year 
by segment  engineered components sales decreased primarily due to low vehicle build in the company s major north american market while flow control products sales decreased primarily due to competitive pricing in the company s markets 
in  consolidated net sales increased to  volume growth in reflects increased sales of the company s performance critical aluminum components and european wheels partly offset by a decline in north american wheel sales and by lower volumes in the flow control products segment 
favorable pricing includes a better product mix  primarily at the company s european operations  and higher aluminum costs reflected in the sales price of automotive products 
these gains were partially offset by a reduction in sales from the sale of superior and by a weaker italian lira 
by segment  engineered components sales increased primarily due to volume gains related to the increased aluminum component sales while flow control products sales decreased primarily due to the loss of two significant customers and decreased sales from divested operations 
gross profit was   and  in   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in from in and in the company s decision to scrap certain slow moving inventories resulted in unusual items of  for inventory write offs in excluding the unusual items  the gross profit percentage was for in the flow control products segment  pricing issues were the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit while significantly lower sales volume and a weaker italian lira led to the decrease in gross profit in the engineered components segment 
during the last half of the year  management of the company began to focus on reducing inventories 
even though the company began to experience a drop in sales early in the year  inventory continued to rise because production continued at plan levels  reaching a peak at midyear 
since february  the company has reduced inventory significantly  however  this had a negative impact on gross profit due to lost absorption 
gross profit of businesses in both segments also suffered from higher energy costs during the winter months 
a combination of internal and external factors affected gross profit in in the flow control products segment  large volume losses associated with two customers at lee brass depressed gross profit 
in addition  this segment experienced sporadic  intense price competition that prevented the company from passing higher copper costs on to its customers 
the flow control units did respond positively to the company wide cost reduction program initiated earlier in the year that partially offset the copper cost and competitive market pricing issues 
in the engineered components segment  reduced sales volumes for certain aluminum wheel styles  coupled with high associate turnover at one wheel plant during the first half of the year  had a negative impact on gross profit 
in north america  the company purchased tooling and reserved capacity to produce wheels for three vehicles that experienced less than anticipated sales volume 
also negatively impacting gross profit in was the continuation of some of the operating issues encountered in the previous year 
in the last half of  the company experienced higher than expected costs and lower product yields due to high turnover of skilled labor in two indiana wheel plants and to the launch of new suspension products at the company s wapakoneta  ohio plant 
the launch proved to be very difficult and was accompanied by high labor turnover  high scrap  low productivity  and significant costs to ensure an adequate customer supply 
in europe  a negative currency impact  the inability to pass through certain material costs  and a factory expansion temporarily depressed gross profit 
the cost of aluminum is a significant component of the overall cost of a wheel 
while the aluminum content of selling prices is periodically adjusted for current market conditions  the purchasing practices and pricing formulas of certain customers of the company s european operations prevented the company from reacting quickly enough to the sharp rise in aluminum prices early in the year 
additionally  the company expanded and rearranged one of its italian plants to increase output and better balance production flow 
during this time period  this facility experienced very high labor turnover which  coupled with the expansion process  had a negative effect on production and gross profit 
several factors had a positive impact on gross profit in effective september   the depreciable lives of certain assets of foreign subsidiaries were changed based upon a study performed by an independent appraisal company 
the effect of this change was a reduction of depreciation expense of approximately  during  the company also changed its method for accounting for supplies and spare parts inventories 
the effect of this change  which is discussed more fully on the following page  was to increase gross profit in by approximately selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses were   and  in   and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses increased to in compared with in and in unusual items recorded in in sg a expense totaled  excluding the unusual items  sg a expense was  or 
the decrease in sg a expenses for reflects a higher net pension expense benefit than in  partially due to a change in the discount rate  lower legal costs  and reduced compensation expense due to the salaried workforce reduction that occurred in the middle of fiscal sg a expense in includes a net pension expense benefit of  primarily as a result of improvement in the defined benefit pension plan s funded status  a one half percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets  and the change to a defined benefit cash balance pension plan 
prior year sg a expense also includes the benefit of the reversal of a  liability resulting from the favorable settlement of a legal claim against the company 
previously  the company had recorded a liability for a legal claim asserted by former employees at its flagg brass operations 
due to the terms of a settlement reached during relative to this obligation  this liability was reversed through a reduction in sg a expense 
sg a expense was also favorably impacted by the results of the company s cost reduction program initiated at the end of its second quarter 
in early march  the company implemented an salaried workforce reduction across all of its north american operations 
at the same time  global restrictions were placed on other controllable operating and administrative costs 
higher commissions  legal costs  and information system expenditures offset these reductions in sg a expense 
prior to acquiring the remaining ownership  ctc was a joint venture and financial results were recorded using the equity method of accounting 
the company s pretax share of losses from ctc while a joint venture  were   and  in   and  respectively 
as previously mentioned  ctc also recorded unusual items in  primarily to increase the allowancefor doubtful and disputed receivables and to write down inventory and tooling 
excluding these unusual items  the company s pretax share of ctc s losses was  while the demand and capacity issues ctc experienced in subsided in  there were some carryover effects in the form of higher costs and manufacturing inefficiencies early in the year and lower volumes later in the year that negatively impacted the results for ctc s results for were severely impacted by a customer s extraordinarily high  temporary demand 
in the second half of  particularly the fourth quarter  ctc was pushed beyond capacity and incurred higher costs associated with operating in excess of capacity to meet the customer s demand 
interest expense was  in   in  and  in as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources  interest rates on the company s borrowings under the prior agreement and the senior notes increased in the last half of fiscal the company will continue with a substantial interest burden until lower cost financing can be put in place 
the effective tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate recorded for fiscal represents an income tax benefit  whereas the rates recorded for fiscal and represents an income tax expense 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was caused primarily by the requirement to increase the valuation allowance against foreign net operating losses by  due to past operating results at the company s european operations 
as of august   the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  of which  relates to the net operating loss carryforwards associated with the purchase of the remainging share of ctc and  is associated with foreign operations 
for additional information regarding the provision for income taxes as well as the difference between effective and statutory tax rates  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company implemented portions of an enterprise resource planning erp system in its automotive businesses in north america 
among other features  this system facilitates the tracking and control of supplies and spare parts inventories 
to take advantage of the enhanced tracking and control features of the erp system  the company capitalized the supplies and spare parts inventories at three locations  whereas previously the cost of these manufacturing supplies was expensed when purchased 
management believed this change was preferable in that it provides for a more appropriate matching of revenues and expenses 
the total amount of inventory capitalized and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  retroactive to september   is  net of income taxes of the effect of the change in was to increase income before cumulative effect of accounting change by 
per share 
management of the company believes the september terrorist attack and the us retaliation could depress the company s markets further  however  management believes that economic recovery in the company s market sector should be no more than six to nine months away 
despite the anticipated lower level of economic activity  the company was awarded six new wheel programs with general motors in north america and its first wheel order in north america with daimler chrysler 
the company has also started up new business that will equal of revenue in europe and added several important pieces of business in suspension components 
in addition  the company began production of front and rear knuckles for saab and opel in europe from two plants in indiana 
in fiscal  the company will focus heavily on reducing sg a spending overall and lowering total labor cost 
flow control products net sales of the flow control products segment were  in  compared with  in and  in the flow control products segment experienced strong competitive market pricing in that  combined with an unfavorable product mix  reduced sales by 
lower volume reduced sales an additional 
the flow control products segment recorded  of unusual items in  primarily to scrap certain slow moving inventories 
excluding the unusual items  flow control products had operating income of  compared with  in the impact of the competitive pricing issues and unfavorable product mix significantly reduced operating profit 
the decrease in is primarily due to lower sales volume of copper and brass products associated with the loss of two customers at the company s lee brass unit and decreased sales from divested operations 
annual sales volume for the two customers was approximately  and the company was able to replace a portion of those sales in the lower volumes decreased sales by compared with while this segment did face sporadic price competition  the reduced volume was partially offset by overall favorable pricing that increased sales by 
operating income was  in compared with  in lower volumes and higher material costs decreased operating income by each 
while price competition prevented the company from passing higher copper costs on to customers  current pricing and favorable product mix combined to increase operating income by 
the cost reduction program implemented in march  combined with continuous improvement activities in the plants  helped to offset the material cost and pricing issues 
engineered components net sales of the engineered components segment were  in  compared with  in and  in sales decreased by due to a drop in volume  particularly at the company s north american operations where the company is coping with a major downturn in us automotive production 
the positive impact of a favorable product mix at the company s european operations was offset by a weaker italian lira in compared with the engineered components segment recorded  of unusual items  primarily to dispose of certain under utilized machinery  tooling  and equipment and to increase the allowance for doubtful and disputed receivables 
excluding the unusual items  engineered components had an operating loss of  compared with operating income of  in significantly lower sales volume and inventory absorption contributed to the operating loss in the company s engineered components product sales continued to grow in  as the global wheel business continues to expand  win new customers  and launch a variety of new wheel styles 
the aluminum components business also experienced significant sales growth as their customers fully incorporated new products into additional vehicle platforms 
sales volume increased as sales of control arms and european wheels were offset by a decline in north american wheels sales as one customer experienced lower sales on three vehicles 
higher pricing  in the form of aluminum cost pass throughs reflected in the selling price of the company s products  and a favorable product mix increased sales by and  respectively 
however  a weaker italian lira in fiscal compared with fiscal reduced sales by 
operating income was  in compared with  in the two accounting changes previously discussed increased operating income  however  several factors negatively impacted operating income during increased costs associated with the over capacity volume issues previously discussed and higher manufacturing related spending decreased operating income by over 
material costs that could not be passed along to customers under existing price formulas  primarily at our european operations  further reduced operating income by 
pricing and an unfavorable product mix reduced operating income by 
also contributing to the decrease in operating income in were costs associated with high levels of employee turnover and the difficulty of obtaining qualified labor in a near full employment economy 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations in was  compared with  in and  in the non cash benefits of depreciation  amortization  and other non cash charges were offset by the net loss for early in fiscal  inventory levels were increased while sales were declining 
the focus of new management of the company has been the management of working capital by collecting accounts receivable and reducing inventories 
however  a significant amount of cash was used to reduce accounts payable from the high level outstanding at august  investing activities used net cash of  in  compared with  in and  in capital expenditures totaled  in and  in  compared to  expended in to support business expansion activities in previous years  investments were made in property  plant  and equipment and in ctc 
capital expenditures decreased significantly in and from prior levels  as the company turned its focus from expansion to cost reduction and improving production efficiencies 
capital expenditures in included equipment to support and produce products for new contracts that have been awarded and to implement new information systems 
at august   the company had  of commitments for capital expenditures to be made in  primarily for the engineered components segment 
in  the company also used  less cash received to purchase the remaining percent share in ctc from its joint venture partner izumi industries  ltd 
the purchase price was approximately  of which  is payable in annual installments over the next five years 
during  the company resolved several matters with the former owners of speedline which  among other items  resulted in a purchase by the company of  shares of the company s common stock held by speedline s former owners and a net cash payment to the former owners of  proceeds from the sale of businesses provided  in financing activities provided  of cash in versus  and  of cash used in and  respectively 
additional financing in included a net increase of  of long term borrowings under the company s revolver agreement and  borrowed under lines of credit 
financing activities also included  received from the sale of treasury shares and  used for the payment of dividends 
the company did not declare dividends in the last two quarters of and due to financial losses  it is unlikely that the company will be in a position to declare any future dividends for at least the immediate future 
during  the company reduced total debt by  and further reduced total debt by  in the debt reductions were financed in part with the proceeds from the superior valve sale in and the proceeds from sale leaseback transactions in both and financing activities also included dividend payments of  and  and repurchases of the company s stock of  and  in and  respectively 
the company maintains a revolver agreement that had provided for up to  in borrowings through august debt covenants under the revolver agreement required the company to maintain certain debt to earnings and interest coverage ratios 
due to operating losses incurred during the second quarter  at march   the company was not in compliance with the debt to earnings and interest coverage ratios under the revolver agreement 
this resulted in a cross violation in the company s senior note agreement the senior notes and the ctc credit agreement the ctc agreement of which the company had guaranteed  at march  the lenders under the revolver agreement  and the ctc agreement have waived the financial covenant violations through april  the lenders under the senior notes have waived the financial covenant violations through september  the company plans to establish new senior note covenants during the first half of fiscal the company also has borrowings outstanding under lines of credit totaling  with an average interest rate of 
the company can no longer borrow additional funds under the revolver agreement or the lines of credit and the lenders now have a subordinated security interest in the assets of the company s us subsidiaries and certain stock of the foreign subsidiaries 
interest rates for borrowings under the revolver agreement increased to prime plus and the senior notes increased to  plus an additional for payment in kind 
on june   the company entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement  which provides for the ability to make new borrowings initially up to  increasing in stages to a maximum of  based on the company meeting certain conditions 
borrowings are limited to specified percentages of eligible receivables  inventories  and property and equipment 
at august   the company had a maximum borrowing capacity of  the credit agreement matures on april  among other things  the credit agreement requires the company to grant a first priority security interest in the company s us assets including  all real property  accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  as well as a subordinated security interest to lenders under the revolver agreement and senior notes 
interest rates for borrowings under the credit agreement are prime plus 
subsequent to august   the company amended the revolver agreement 
this amendment extended the revolver agreement through september and established new financial covenants with it s lenders in which the company must  among other things  maintain quarterly levels of total liabilities to tangible net worth  free cash flow  ebitda  and meet scheduled debt repayments 
the maximum level of total liabilities to tangible net worth is not to exceed at december   at march   at june   and at august  the minimum level of free cash flow is to be  at december    at march    at june   and  at august  in addition  the company must make scheduled debt reductions which are included with the current portion of long term debt of   and  at the end of the first  third  and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
if these minimum levels are not maintained  any outstanding balances become payable upon demand by the company s lenders 
based on the company s forcasted ability to comply with the revised debt covenants  it continues to classify debt as long term 
the credit agreement and ctc agreement also include a subjective acceleration clause whereby the lenders can declare an event of default upon any material adverse change as defined by the lenders 
at august   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and  was outstanding under the ctc agreement 
in order to meet the new financial covenants  the company needs to achieve operating results substantially consistent with its operating plan 
this plan calls for sales to be slightly higher than in the company plans to reduce cost of goods sold through improved plant efficiencies  decreasing inventories  higher productivity  and lower scrap 
in addition  the company plans to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses primarily through reductions in personnel and employee benefit costs  and other cost savings programs 
in consideration for the credit agreement and waiver of covenant violations under the revolver agreement and senior notes  the company granted warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire june  if the maturity date of the revolver agreement is extended to september  warrants for the purchase of an additional  shares will be issued 
the ctc agreement provided for borrowings under a revolving credit facility and a term loan 
at august    was outstanding on the revolver and  was outstanding on the term loan  both with interest rates at prime plus 
ctc subsequently entered into a new credit facility  effective september   that provides for up to  in borrowings with interest rates at prime or libor plus 
the revolver portion matures september and the term loan matures august the senior notes originally required periodic principal payments beginning in november through november the maturity date of the senior notes is now november if the maturity date of the revolver agreement is extended to september  the principal payment under the senior notes that is due november  will be extended to november the company s foreign operations have short term lines of credit totaling approximately  that are subject to annual review by the lending banks 
amounts outstanding under these lines of credit are payable on demand and total  as of august  the ratio of long term debt as a percent of capital increased to at august  from at august  book value per common share at august  was  down from at august  one million preferred shares and approximately million common shares are authorized and available for future issuance 
on december   the company announced a plan to repurchase up to  of its outstanding common shares 
as of august    shares have been repurchased under this plan at an average cost of per share 
the company currently has  common shares outstanding 
management believes the company has adequate financial resources to meet its future needs 
contingencies the company  as is normal for the industry in which it operates  is involved in certain legal proceedings and subject to certain claims and site investigations that arise under the environmental laws and which have not been finally adjudicated 
to the extent possible  with the information available  the company regularly evaluates its responsibility with respect to environmental proceedings 
the factors considered in this evaluation are more fully described in the commitments and contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements 
at august   the company had reserves of  accrued for environmental liabilities 
based upon the contracts and agreements with regards to two environmental matters  the company believes it is entitled to indemnity for remediation costs at two sites and believes it is probable that the company can recover a substantial portion of the costs 
accordingly  the company has recorded receivables of  related to anticipated recoveries from third parties 
allied signal inc now honeywell brought an action against the company seeking a contribution from the company equal to of honeywell s estimated  remediation cost in connection with a site in southern ohio 
the company believes its responsibility with respect to this site is very limited due to the nature of the foundry sand waste it disposed of at the site 
the court has rendered its decision on this case  however  the exact amount of the verdict has not yet been determined by the court 
the amount will be significantly less than the amount sought by the plaintiff and the company estimates its liability associated with the action to be between and  the company believes its liability is at the low end of this range 
the company is of the opinion that  in light of its existing reserves  its liability in connection with environmental proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company is presently unaware of the existence of any potential material environmental costs that are likely to occur in connection with disposition of any of its property 
impact of recently issued accounting standards new accounting standards adopted during include sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
and  which establishes a comprehensive standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
the new standard requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and be measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value are required to be recognized in current earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met 
special accounting allows for gains or losses on qualifying derivatives to offset gains or losses on the hedged item in the statement of income and requires formal documentation of the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the company also adopted the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations 
new accounting standards issued include sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
discontinues the use of the pooling of interest method and requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  the new standard also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet to be recognized apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment  at least on an annual basis  and written down in the periods in which the recorded amount is greater than the fair value 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
these standards only permit prospective application  therefore  adoption of these standards will not affect previously reported financial information 
sfas nos 
and will become effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal  however  the company is evaluating early adoption as of september  the company will evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior business combinations and  upon adoption of the new standards  make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
if early adopted  the company will be required to perform initial impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas no 
 as of the date of this report  the company cannot estimate the entire impact adopting the standard will have on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows  however amortization expense of  related to goodwill would be eliminated in the adoption of sfas no 
should not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and sfas no 
accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets were also issued sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for certain obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the related retirement costs 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and supercedes sfas no 
both standards will become effective for the company in fiscal the company has not determined the effect of these new standards 
market risks the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as part of its normal operations 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures on a consolidated basis  the company takes advantage of natural offsets 
the company has estimated its market risk exposures using sensitivity analyses assuming a change in market rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk due to its foreign operations  the company has assets  liabilities  and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company minimizes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its italian net investment with debt borrowings denominated in italian lira 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact the dollar value of non us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the dollar value of non us cash flows  a hypothetical change in the average exchange rates for and would change income before taxes by approximately and  respectively 
the company s italian operations also attempt to balance asset and liability positions that are denominated in non functional currencies  primarily the us dollar  japanese yen  and british pound sterling 
during and  the net exposure averaged approximately  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the average exchange rates would change the exposure by for and by for  respectively  and that change would be reflected in the operating results of the company 
the analysis assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates  relative to the italian lira 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction  and the assumption that the exchange rates change in parallel may overstate the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the increase in net exposure between years is primarily due to unfavorable italian lira exchange rates 
interest rate risk to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  the company uses both fixed and variable rate debt 
at august  and  the company had approximately  and  of debt obligations outstanding with variable interest rates with a weighted average effective interest rate of and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the effective interest rate for these borrowings  using the outstanding debt levels at august  and  would change interest expense by approximately  and respectively 
the increase in interest rate exposure is primarily due to higher effective interest rates
