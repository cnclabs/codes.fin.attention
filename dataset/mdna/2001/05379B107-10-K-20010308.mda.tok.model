electric operations in addition to providing electric transmission and distribution services  avista utilities is responsible for electric generation and production 
avista utilities owns and operates eight hydroelectric projects  a wood waste fueled generating station and two natural gas fired combustion turbine ct generating units 
it also owns a share in a two unit coal fired generating facility and leases and operates two additional natural gas fired ct generating units 
in addition  avista utilities has a number of long term power purchase and exchange contracts that increase its available resources 
with this diverse energy resource portfolio  avista utilities remains one of the nation s lowest cost producers of electric energy services 
see item properties generating plants for additional information 
avista utilities sells and purchases electric capacity and energy at wholesale to and from utilities and other entities under firm long term contracts having terms of more than one year 
in addition  avista utilities engages in short term sales and purchases in the wholesale market as part of an economic selection of resources to serve its retail and firm wholesale loads 
avista utilities makes continuing projections of future retail and firm wholesale loads based on  among other things  forward estimates of factors such as customer usage and weather as well as historical data and contract terms and resource availability based on  among other things  estimates of streamflows  generating unit availability  historic and forward market information and experience 
on the basis of these continuing projections  avista utilities makes purchases and sales of energy on a quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly basis to match actual resources to actual energy requirements  as it operates the lowest cost resources to serve its load requirements  and sells any surplus at the best available price 
this process includes hedging transactions 
in the second quarter of  certain wholesale transactions contributed to significant losses in avista utilities  as more fully discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
avista utilities competes in the electric wholesale market with other western utilities  federal marketing agencies and power marketers 
the electric wholesale market has changed significantly over the last few years with respect to market participants  level of activity  variability of prices and credit 
these changes have contributed to the increased volatility of the market 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  significant changes in energy markets for information about the california energy situation 
avista energy  a wholly owned subsidiary of avista corp  pursues electric energy trading activities  however  avista energy s activities are not related to avista utilities operations 
challenges facing avista utilities electric operations include  among other things  changes in the availability of and volatility in the prices of power and fuel  generating unit availability  legislative and governmental regulations  avista corporation weather conditions and the ability to recover increased costs of purchased power 
avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded utility assets resulting from deregulation due to its low cost generation portfolio 
in a deregulated environment  however  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies could affect the market price of power  and certain generating assets could have capital and operating costs above the adjusted market price

electric requirements avista utilities annual peak requirements  including long term and short term contractual obligations  were  mw 
this peak occurred on january   at which time the maximum capacity available from avista utilities generating facilities  including long term and short term purchases  was  mw 
the electric requirements include both retail distribution needs and wholesale short term and long term commitments 
variations in energy usage by avista utilities ultimate customers occur from year to year  from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
this results in a continual balancing of loads and resources  and requires both purchases and sales of energy on a quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly basis in order to be able to meet its load with the lowest cost resources 
electric resources general avista utilities diverse resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges  combined with strategic access to regional electric transmission systems  enables it to remain one of the nation s lowest cost producers and sellers of retail electric energy services 
at december   avista utilities total owned resources available were hydroelectric and thermal 
see avista utilities electric operating statistics for energy resource statistics 
hydroelectric resources total hydroelectric resources provide amw annually under normal streamflow conditions 
hydroelectric generation is avista utilities lowest cost source of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on its total energy costs 
under average operating conditions  avista utilities meets approximately one third of its total energy requirements both retail and long term wholesale with its own hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric contracts 
the streamflows to company owned hydroelectric projects were  and of normal in  and  respectively 
thermal resources total thermal resources provide amw annually under normal operating conditions 
avista utilities has a interest in a twin unit coal fired generating facility  the colstrip generating project colstrip in southeastern montana 
avista utilities also owns a wood waste fired generating facility known as the kettle falls generating station kettle falls in northeastern washington and two natural gas fired ct generating units  located in spokane northeast combustion turbine 
in addition  avista utilities also operates and leases two natural gas fired ct generating units in northern idaho rathdrum 
avista utilities also had a interest in another twin unit coal fired generating facility  the centralia power plant centralia in western washington 
on may   the owners of centralia sold the plant to transalta  a canadian company 
avista utilities is purchasing energy from transalta to replace the output from centralia for the period from july  through december  avista utilities will receive approximately megawatts per hour beginning each july and continuing through march of the following year during the term of the contract 
in  and  centralia provided approximately  and  respectively  of avista utilities thermal generation 
colstrip  which is operated by ppl global  inc  is supplied with fuel under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through december from adjacent coal reserves 
in  and  colstrip provided approximately  and of avista utilities thermal generation  respectively 
kettle falls primary fuel is wood waste generated as a by product from forest industry operations within one hundred miles of the plant 
natural gas may be used as an alternate fuel 
a combination of long term contracts plus spot purchases provides avista utilities the flexibility to meet expected future fuel requirements for the plant 
in  and  kettle falls provided approximately  and of avista utilities thermal generation  respectively 
the four cts are natural gas fired generating units that formerly were primarily used for peaking needs 
due to the high demand for power during and the relative operating cost compared to higher wholesale market prices  these generating units were run on a more regular basis  and will continue to be run more regularly in the avista corporation future 
all four cts have access to domestic and or canadian natural gas supplies 
in  and  these four units provided approximately  and  respectively  of avista utilities thermal generation 
purchases  exchanges and sales in  avista utilities had various long term purchase contracts with non coincident peak peak that does not occur during the same hour equating to mw 
additionally  long term hydroelectric purchase contracts of mw peak were available 
avista utilities also enters into a significant number of short term sales and purchases with durations of up to one year 
energy purchases and exchanges for the years  and provided approximately  and  respectively  of avista utilities total electric energy requirements 
under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  avista utilities is required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities  including small hydroelectric and cogeneration projects  at avoided cost rates adopted by the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc 
avista utilities purchased approximately  mwh  or about of its total energy requirements  from these sources at a cost of approximately million in these contracts expire at various times during the period future resource needs in august  the wutc approved avista utilities plan for a request for proposal rfp process to increase its power resources 
new resources are needed to serve avista utilities long term load requirements 
as part of the order  the wutc agreed to waive normal time limits related to going out into the market to determine the resource options available to avista utilities 
in december  avista utilities selected the coyote springs project near boardman  oregon 
the coyote springs project is a combined cycle natural gas fired combustion turbine with generation output of approximately megawatts 
key factors in the selection of coyote springs included its fully licensed status and the fact that the manufacture and delivery of natural gas turbine equipment that will power the project is secured 
engineering and procurement of the other required major equipment began in january  with completion of construction expected in june permits and contract modifications are being filed to transfer ownership at cost to avista utilities from its subsidiary  avista power  which previously acquired the rights for the project from enron north america and portland general electric 
the company is working to secure a term loan for financing the construction 
the total cost of the project is estimated at million 
in addition  avista utilities selected three demand side management proposals which will yield approximately mw in energy savings over a three year period 
avista utilities expects negotiations of these proposals to be finalized during the first quarter of avista utilities has operational strategies in place to address the issue of available resources to meet the increased demand for energy 
future capital expenditures include plans for increasing capacity and generation at various hydroelectric and thermal generating plants 
in addition  action is being taken to increase the energy output from the ct generating units owned and leased by avista utilities 
on february   avista utilities filed for permission to increase the amount of operating hours allowed and for a small increase in the amount of emissions allowed for minor pollutants 
the increase in operating hours does not require an increase in the emission levels of major pollutants from these cts 
approval of the request is expected in mid avista utilities is also in the process of upgrading the air operating permit at the ct units in spokane to a title v permit  which will increase the annual amount of emissions allowed 
in addition  avista utilities is asking to add additional pollution control equipment at the site in order to increase the available hours of operation 
the company reached an agreement with the spokane county air pollution control authority that will allow operation of the northeast combustion turbine for a day period  beginning february   when it would have been idled due to pollution control limits  producing power equivalent to amw on an annual basis 
in return for this waiver  the company will contribute up to  to a fund to defray the energy expenses of low income residents of spokane county  and will also spend up to  to design and implement an environmental offset project to reduce emissions in an amount equivalent to the emissions of the plant during the waiver period 
under normal water conditions and loads  avista utilities own generation plants and long term contracts would be able to provide approximately of its forecasted native load energy requirements in  and thereof in and the balance would be covered through short term contracts 
avista utilities has covered essentially all of its electric energy requirements in the forward markets for current forecasts show streamflow conditions for hydroelectric generation for  estimated at of normal  to be among the worst five avista corporation years on record 
in response to the reduced hydroelectric generation  avista utilities has made additional fixed price purchases of energy  and expects to receive the necessary local  state and federal approvals to increase the energy output of its gas fired thermal generation to cover its firm retail and wholesale load requirements for  with minimal additional purchases expected from the high cost short term wholesale market 
however  if hydroelectric conditions further deteriorate  its thermal plants do not operate as planned  or weather conditions cause retail loads to increase  avista utilities would incur increased costs from increased purchases in the short term wholesale energy market 
forecasted electric requirements and resources average mw requirements system load   contracts short term sales total requirements    resources system contract hydro company owned thermal generation contracts for purchased power short term purchased power total resources    surplus resources decrease from to reflects the expiration of a long term sales contract 
there is a corresponding decrease in resources as a result of the contract expiration 
this information assumes no renewal of the contract 
forecast above assumes normal water  which is the median of the years of water between and water conditions are expected to be of normal in due to current snow pack conditions 
avista utilities currently anticipates that hydro generation may be as much as amw below normal in this is offset by the waiver received on february   for northeast combustion turbine amw  the original estimated surplus from the table above amw  the anticipated change in rathdrum permit to allow for additional hours of operations amw and additional short term purchases 
hydroelectric relicensing avista corp 
is a licensee under the federal power act  which regulates certain of its hydroelectric generation resources and is administered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and its licensed projects are subject to the provisions of part i of that act 
these provisions include payment for headwater benefits  condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation  and take over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of net investment or fair value of the project  in either case plus severance damages 
all but one of the company s hydroelectric plants are regulated by the ferc through project licenses issued for year periods 
see item properties avista utilities for additional information 
the cabinet gorge and noxon rapids plants mw received a new year operating license from the ferc on february  the existing licenses were combined into one license under the name clark fork projects 
the application to relicense cabinet gorge and noxon rapids was filed with the ferc on february   and included the clark fork settlement agreement signed by parties and a collaboratively written environmental assessment report 
the application culminated seven years of planning and consultation with native american tribes  special interest groups  resource agencies and the general public 
settlement was reached two years before the license expired  and preserved the projects economic peaking and load following operations 
as part of the settlement agreement  avista utilities committed to early implementation of protection  mitigation and enhancement measures  which began in march measures in the agreement  which will cost approximately million annually  address issues related to fisheries  water quality  wildlife  recreation  land use  cultural avista corporation resources and erosion 
recovery of previously deferred hydro relicensing costs  as well as estimated levels of ongoing costs associated with implementation of the settlement agreement  have been addressed by both the wutc and ipuc and received favorable treatment 
process costs that had been deferred during the licensing phase were allowed in rate base and are being amortized over the year license term 
the ongoing settlement agreement costs were allowed as operating expenses 
see item properties avista utilities and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future outlook for additional information 
the issue of high dissolved gas levels which exceed idaho water quality standards downstream of cabinet gorge during spill periods continues to be studied  as agreed to in the settlement agreement 
to date  intensive biological studies in the lower clark fork river and lake pend oreille have documented minimal biological effects of high dissolved gas levels on free ranging fish 
an engineering feasibility study has identified several possible structural alternatives at cabinet gorge that may reduce dissolved gas levels 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will develop an abatement and or mitigation strategy in in conjunction with the other signatories to the agreement 
the company operates six hydroelectric plants mw on the spokane river  and five of these long lake  nine mile  upper falls  monroe street and post falls are under one ferc license 
the sixth  little falls  is not licensed by the ferc 
the license for the spokane river projects expires in august  and the company will be required to file a notice of intent to relicense prior to august planning  discussions with stakeholder groups and information gathering activities are currently underway 
natural gas operations natural gas commodity prices increased dramatically during however  market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers 
proven reserves and future natural gas development opportunities lead avista utilities to believe that natural gas should sustain its market advantage 
significant growth has occurred in the natural gas business in recent years due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction 
avista utilities also makes sales and provides transportation service directly to large natural gas customers 
most of avista utilities large industrial customers purchase their own natural gas requirements through gas marketers 
for these customers  avista utilities provides transportation from its pipeline interconnection to the customer s premises 
avista utilities has numerous individual contracts for natural gas transportation service  most of which contain negotiated rates for its distribution service based on the customer s competitive alternatives 
seven of avista utilities largest natural gas customers are provided natural gas transportation service under individual contracts 
these negotiated contracts were entered into to retain these customers who can either by pass avista utilities distribution system or have competitive alternative fuel capability 
all individual contracts are subject to regulatory review and approval 
the competitive nature of the natural gas spot market results in savings in the cost of purchased natural gas  which encourages large customers with fuel switching capabilities to continue to utilize natural gas for their energy needs when economic 
the total volume transported on behalf of transportation customers for  and was approximately  and million therms  which represented approximately  and of avista utilities total system deliveries 
challenges facing avista utilities natural gas operations include  among other things  volatility in the price of natural gas  changes in the availability of natural gas  legislative and governmental regulations  weather conditions  conservation and the ability to recover increased costs of natural gas 
natural gas resources natural gas supply a diverse portfolio of resources allows avista utilities to capture market opportunities that benefit its natural gas customers 
natural gas supplies are available from both domestic and canadian sources through both long and short term  or spot market  purchases 
avista utilities holds capacity on six pipelines and owns natural gas storage facilities 
this allows avista utilities to optimize its available resources 
the company s energy trading and marketing subsidiary  avista energy  is responsible for the daily management and optimization of these resources for the requirements of customers in the states of washington  idaho and oregon under an agreement with avista utilities 
under this relationship  avista utilities retains ownership of its transportation  storage and long term contracts and avista energy acts as an agent to optimize these important avista corporation resources 
the utility commissions have approved benchmark incentive mechanisms that allow avista utilities and its customers to share some of the benefits of avista energy s resource optimization activities 
see regulatory issues for additional information 
firm natural gas supplies are available through negotiated agreements for terms ranging between one month and seven years 
approximately of the natural gas supply is obtained from domestic sources  with the remaining from canadian sources 
nearly all natural gas purchased from canadian sources is contracted in us dollar denominations  limiting any foreign currency exchange exposure 
canadian natural gas supplies are not considered to be at greater risk of non delivery than us supplies 
avista utilities holds capacity on six natural gas pipelines  northwest pipeline company nwp  gas transmission northwest gtn  paiute pipeline paiute  tuscarora gas transmission company tuscarora  nova pipeline  ltd 
nova and alberta natural gas co 
ltd 
ang  which provide it access to both domestic and canadian natural gas supplies 
avista utilities contracts with nwp for three types of firm service transportation  liquefied natural gas storage and underground storage  with paiute for firm transportation and liquefied natural gas storage and with gtn  tuscarora  nova and ang for firm transportation only 
jackson prairie natural gas storage project storage project avista utilities owns a one third interest in the storage project  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
the role of the storage project in providing flexible natural gas supplies is increasingly important to avista utilities natural gas operations 
it enables avista utilities to place natural gas into storage when prices are low or to meet minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are high or as needed to meet high demand periods 
during  avista utilities completed the process of increasing the capacity at the storage project 
this increased capacity is being operated and managed by avista energy for the next ten years 
avista utilities has contracted to release some of its storage project capacity to two other utilities until and  with a provision under one of the releases to partially recall the released capacity if avista utilities determines additional natural gas storage is required for its own system supply 
regulatory issues avista corp  as a regulated public utility  is currently subject to regulation by state utility commissions with respect to prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc and the ipuc 
the retail natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc  the ipuc  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the california public utilities commission cpuc 
the company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for its wholesale natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity from the jackson prairie storage project  and for electric transmission service and wholesale electric sales 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  the price the company may charge for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval is currently determined on a cost of service basis and is designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation of utility plant 
as the energy business is restructured  traditional cost of service ratemaking may evolve into some other form of ratemaking 
rates for transmission services are based on the cost of service principles and are set forth in tariffs on file with the ferc

general rate cases in october  avista utilities filed with the wutc a request for a general electric rate increase of million  or  subsequently revised to million  and a general natural gas rate increase of million  or 
on september   the wutc ordered a million  or  reduction in electric rates and a million  or  increase in natural gas rates 
the wutc also ordered that avista utilities annual rate of return on investment for both electricity and natural gas be reduced from its current rate of return of to 
avista utilities had requested a rate of return 
avista utilities filed a petition for reconsideration before the wutc requesting that the commission reconsider certain portions of its order 
on november   avista corporation the commission slightly modified the original order by reducing the electric reduction from million to million and increasing the natural gas increase from million to million 
in avista utilities last general electric rate case in the state of idaho  the ipuc granted a rate increase of million  or  with an authorized rate of return of  effective august power cost deferrals washington on august   the wutc approved avista utilities request for deferred accounting treatment for certain power costs related to increases in short term power prices beginning july  and ending june  the specific power costs deferred include the changes in power costs to avista utilities from those included in base retail rates  related to three power cost components the net effect of changes in short term wholesale market prices on short term wholesale purchases and sales  the effect on power costs from changes in the level of hydroelectric generation  and the net effect on power costs from changes in the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices 
the deferrals each month are calculated as the difference between the actual costs to avista utilities associated with these three power cost components  and the level of costs included in avista utilities base retail rates 
the power costs deferred are related solely to the operation of avista utilities system resources to serve its system retail and wholesale load obligations 
during  the company deferred a total of million under this accounting order 
on january   the wutc approved a modification to the deferral mechanism to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  effective december  the wutc also required avista utilities to file a proposal by mid march that will address the prudency of the incurred power costs  the optimization of company owned resources to the benefit of retail customers  the appropriateness of recovery of power costs through a deferral mechanism  a proposal for cost of capital offsets to recognize the shift in risk from shareholders to ratepayers and avista utilities plan to mitigate the deferred power costs 
avista utilities also plans to file for an extension of the deferred accounting treatment beyond june power cost adjustment pca idaho avista utilities has a pca mechanism in idaho that tracks changes in hydroelectric generation  secondary energy prices  related changes in thermal generation  as well as changes in purpa contracts  but not changes in revenues or costs associated with other wheeling or power contracts 
rate changes were triggered when the deferred balance reached million 
no more than two surcharges or rebates are to be in effect at the same time 
a new trigger of million was effective beginning december on january   avista utilities filed an application with the ipuc seeking proposed modifications to the existing pca mechanism 
due to extremely high short term power prices  avista utilities is requesting to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  as well as to recover replacement power costs associated with possible thermal plant forced outages 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information 
purchased gas adjustment pga or natural gas trackers natural gas trackers are supplemental tariffs filed with state regulatory commissions which are designed to pass through changes in purchased natural gas costs  and do not normally result in any changes in net income 
in december  avista utilities filed natural gas trackers with the wutc  ipuc and opuc requesting increases of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively 
avista utilities received effective approval dates from the wutc of january   the ipuc of february   and the opuc of january  in february  avista utilities filed with cpuc a gas tracker requesting an increase of million  or 
prior to the above mentioned increases  the wutc and ipuc each approved increases of effective september  the opuc approved a increase effective october  natural gas benchmark mechanism avista utilities received regulatory approval of its natural gas benchmark mechanism in from the ipuc  wutc and opuc 
the mechanism eliminates natural gas procurement operations within avista utilities and consolidates gas procurement operations under avista energy  the company s non regulated affiliate 
the ownership of the natural gas assets remains with avista utilities  but the assets are managed by avista energy through an agency agreement 
avista utilities maintains a natural gas staff to prepare load forecasts and analyses related to long term resource acquisitions  to manage the agency agreement with avista energy and to support state and federal regulatory activities 
the natural gas benchmark mechanism was implemented september  and runs through march  consolidation of natural gas procurement operations under avista energy allows the company to gain synergies and better manage its risk by combining and operating the two portfolios as one portfolio and gain efficiencies by eliminating duplicate functions 
effective january   the wutc and ipuc approved avista utilities modifications to the benchmark mechanism  incorporating the use of financial products fixed price transactions or hedging 
due to the unprecedented increase in and volatility of natural gas commodity costs  it was determined that avista corporation such additional flexibility was needed in the mechanism to properly manage costs 
the use of financial products was incorporated in the original oregon mechanism 
the natural gas benchmark mechanism provides certain guaranteed benefits to retail customers and provides the company with the opportunity to improve earnings  ie  a performance based mechanism 
demand side management dsm programs on january   avista utilities filed a request with the wutc and ipuc to implement a natural gas revenue surcharge of to provide funding for natural gas energy efficiency programs 
the wutc approved the surcharge effective february  and the ipuc approved it effective february  avista utilities currently has an electric revenue surcharge  or tariff rider  of approximately and in washington and idaho  respectively  to fund its electric dsm programs 
avista utilities expects to file a request with the ipuc in mid march to increase the idaho electric dsm rider to 
the tariff rider has been in place since and was the first system benefit charge for energy efficiency in the country 
industry restructuring federal level industry restructuring to open the electric wholesale energy market to competition was initially promoted by federal legislation 
the energy policy act of energy act amended provisions of the public utility holding company act of puhca and the federal power act to remove certain barriers to a competitive wholesale market 
the energy act confers expanded authority upon the ferc to issue orders requiring electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and to require electric utilities to enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
it also created exempt wholesale generators  a new class of independent power plant owners that are able to sell generation only at the wholesale level 
this permits public utilities and other entities to participate through subsidiaries in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers without being required to register under the puhca 
ferc order no 
 issued in april  requires public utilities operating under the federal power act to provide access to their transmission systems to third parties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ferc s pro forma open access transmission tariff 
ferc order no 
 the companion rule to order no 
 requires public utilities to establish an open access same time information system oasis to provide transmission customers with information about available transmission capacity and other information by electronic means 
it also requires each public utility subject to the rule to functionally separate its transmission and wholesale power merchant functions 
the ferc issued its initial order accepting the non rate terms and conditions of avista utilities open access transmission tariff in november avista utilities filed its procedures for implementing standards of conduct under ferc order no 
with the ferc in december and adopted these procedures effective january  ferc orders no 
and no 
have not had a material effect on avista utilities operating results 
in december  ferc order no 
was issued regarding the development of regional transmission organizations rto 
this final rule required public utilities subject to ferc regulation to file an rto proposal  or a description of efforts to participate in an rto  and any existing obstacles to rto participation  by october avista utilities and five other western utilities have taken steps toward the formation of an independent transmission company  transconnect  which would serve six states 
transconnect would be a member of the planned regional transmission organization  rto west 
the new  for profit company would own or lease the high voltage transmission facilities currently held by the company  montana power co  puget sound energy corp  portland general electric co  nevada power co 
and sierra pacific power co 
the proposal was filed october  if a final proposal emerges  it must be approved by the ferc  the boards of directors of the filing companies and regulators in various states 
the companies decision to move forward with the formation of transconnect will ultimately depend on the economics and conditions related to the formation of transconnect  as well as the economics and conditions related to the regulatory approval process 
the north american electric reliability council and the western systems coordinating council wscc have undertaken initiatives to establish a series of security coordinators to oversee the reliable operation of the regional transmission system 
accordingly  avista utilities  in cooperation with other utilities in the pacific northwest  established the pacific northwest security coordinator pnsc  which oversees daily and short term operations of the northwest sub regional transmission grid  and has limited authority to direct certain actions of control area avista corporation operators in the case of a pending transmission system emergency 
avista utilities executed its service agreement with the pnsc in september state level further competition may be introduced by state action 
competition for retail customers is not generally allowed in avista utilities service territory 
while the energy act precludes the ferc from mandating retail wheeling  state regulators and legislators could open service territories to full competition at the retail level 
legislative action at the state level would be required for full retail wheeling and customer choice to occur in washington and idaho 
for the past several years  the legislatures and public utility commissions in washington and idaho have conducted a series of hearings and several studies regarding electric industry restructuring 
issues such as unbundling  deregulation  reliability and consumer protection have been examined 
impacts on customer service quality and system reliability generation  transmission and distribution have been considered on a macro basis under various restructuring scenarios 
public policy makers in washington and idaho continue to examine other states experiences with restructuring  while cognizant that the pacific northwest generally benefits from the lowest electric rates in the country 
although there is currently no action surrounding deregulation in washington or idaho  activities related to california s deregulation have affected wholesale power prices in the west  including the company s service territory 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information about the california energy situation 
environmental issues the company is subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which avista utilities has an ownership interest have been designed to comply with all environmental laws presently applicable 
furthermore  the company conducts periodic reviews of all its facilities and operations to anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has an environmental committee to deal specifically with these issues 
air quality the most significant impact of the clean air act caa and the clean air act amendments caaa was on the centralia power plant  which is classified as a phase ii coal plant under the caaa 
obligations under the caa were assumed by transalta when the sale of centralia was completed in may colstrip  which is also a phase ii coal fired plant under the caaa  is not expected to be required to implement any additional so mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations 
avista utilities other thermal projects also are subject to various caaa standards 
every five years each project requires an updated operating permit known as a title v permit which addresses  among other things  the compliance of the plant with the caaa

avista corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview avista corporation avista corp 
or the company operates as an energy  information and technology company with a regional utility operation and subsidiary operations located in the pacific northwest 
the company s operations are organized into four lines of business avista utilities  energy trading and marketing  information and technology  and avista ventures 
avista utilities  which is an operating division of avista corp 
and not a separate entity  represents the regulated utility operations 
avista capital  a wholly owned subsidiary of avista corp  owns all of the subsidiary companies engaged in the other lines of business 
as of december   the company had common equity investments of million and million in avista utilities and avista capital  respectively 
in addition to providing electricity and natural gas distribution and electric transmission services  avista utilities is responsible for electric generation and production 
avista utilities owns and operates eight hydroelectric projects  a wood waste fueled generating station and two natural gas fired combustion turbine ct generating units 
it also owns a share in a two unit coal fired generating facility and leases and operates two additional natural gas fired ct generating units 
in addition  avista utilities has a number of long term power purchase and exchange contracts that increase its available resources 
with this diverse energy resource portfolio  avista utilities remains one of the nation s lowest cost producers of electric energy services 
avista utilities sells and purchases electric capacity and energy at wholesale to and from utilities and other entities under firm long term contracts having terms of more than one year 
in addition  avista utilities engages in short term sales and purchases in the wholesale market as part of an economic selection of resources to serve its retail and firm wholesale loads 
avista utilities makes continuing projections of future retail and firm wholesale loads based on  among other things  forward estimates of factors such as customer usage and weather as well as historical data and contract terms and resource availability based on  among other things  estimates of streamflows  generating unit availability  historic and forward market information and experience 
on the basis of these continuing projections  avista utilities makes purchases and sales of energy on a quarterly  monthly  daily and hourly basis to match actual resources to actual energy requirements  as it operates the lowest cost resources to serve its load requirements  and sells any surplus at the best available price 
this process includes hedging transactions 
in the second quarter of  certain wholesale transactions contributed to significant losses in avista utilities  as more fully discussed below in results of operations 
the energy trading and marketing line of business excludes the regulated utility operations  avista utilities  and is comprised of avista energy  inc avista energy  avista power  inc avista power and avista steag  llc avista steag 
avista energy is an electricity and natural gas trading and marketing business  operating primarily in the western systems coordinating council wscc

the avista ventures line of business includes avista ventures  inc avista ventures  and several other minor subsidiaries 
this line of business is responsible for investing in business opportunities that have potential value in the lines of business in which the company is already involved 
significant changes in energy markets avista corporation regulatory  political  economic and technological changes have brought about the accelerating transformation of the utility and energy industries  presenting both opportunities and challenges 
these changes have had a significant effect on energy markets 
historically  the price of power in wholesale markets has been affected primarily by production costs and by other factors including streamflows  the availability of hydro and thermal generation and transmission capacity  weather and the resulting retail loads  and the price of coal  natural gas and oil for thermal generating units 
any combination of these factors that resulted in a shortage of energy or increased cost of production generally caused the market price of power to move upward 
now  however  wholesale power market prices appear to react more independently from traditional cost driven and supply and demand factors 
significant emerging factors include the gradual depletion of excess generating capacity in the wscc  increasing instances of transmission congestion and increased ownership of generating facilities by entities which are not traditional public utilities 
wholesale power markets have been affected by the restructuring of electric utility regulation at the state and federal levels 
wholesale power prices rose dramatically starting in the second quarter of and remain significantly above historic levels in the pacific northwest and throughout the wscc 
federal and state officials  including the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the california public utility commission cpuc  commenced reviews to determine the cause of the market changes 
additionally  president bush has appointed vice president cheney to chair an energy policy task force at least in part as a response to the extreme market pressures and power shortages that have affected california and other parts of the wscc 
the governors of washington  oregon and idaho have also become involved in seeking to stabilize power market prices and the availability of power in the region 
california energy crisis 
during  particularly in the fourth quarter  the changes in western energy markets resulted in an energy supply shortage that particularly affected power availability in california 
power shortages  coupled with california s power market structure  led to the two largest of california s three investor owned utilities ious  southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric pg e  issuing warnings of their impending inability to meet payment commitments 
in the first quarter of  sce and pg e defaulted on several hundred million dollars of payment obligations owed to various creditors 
because of regulatory changes that were adopted by california law in  california s ious were required to divest ownership of much of their owned power generation capacity  to sell output from their remaining generating plants into a power market  to reduce retail customer prices and hold them at a fixed level until certain transition charges were amortized  and to buy all requirements for customers needs through short term purchases from the newly created california power exchange calpx  california independent system operator caliso  automated power exchange apx and other specified entities 
as demand began to outstrip supply in california  the price of power skyrocketed and these ious bought power at much higher prices than they sold it to end users 
they exhausted their credit and capital capacity early in the pg e and sce defaults resulted in subsequent defaults by calpx  caliso and apx in amounts the latter three parties owed to avista energy 
there were approximately participants in the calpx at the end of avista energy participated in transactions with the calpx and caliso  primarily as a seller 
the calpx tariff  approved by the ferc  includes a provision that permits backcharges to calpx participants under certain circumstances to keep its settlement accounts whole in the event of a default by a participant 
the calpx tariff specifies that collateral and contracts of the defaulting parties be liquidated to provide funds to cover their defaults  followed by liquidation of a performance bond posted by participants collectively  before backcharges will be levied 
the calpx did not obtain sufficient collateral from sce or pg e to assure their performance  even when signals of their financial difficulties were gaining attention from rating agencies  from the press  and from reports filed by sce and pg e with the securities and exchange commission 
when sce and pg e defaulted  the governor of california obtained a temporary restraining order tro to block the calpx from liquidating the sce and pg e contracts 
when the tro expired and an injunction was not granted  the governor invoked emergency executive powers to seize those contracts 
the calpx began levying backcharges by withholding amounts payable to participants and sending invoices for additional amounts 
in january  the calpx gave notice that it was suspending its block forward and day ahead market operations 
several of the calpx participants  including pg e  have protested the backcharges through filings with the ferc and the courts 
avista energy is among the entities seeking to have the backcharge provisions ruled inoperable by the ferc 
in its second round of backcharges in february  the calpx backcharged remaining participants for the increasing cascade of defaults  leading to the possibility that  if backcharges were continued and additional parties either could not or would not pay amounts so invoiced  the last remaining participant might bear the entire market s settlement obligation 
on february   avista energy obtained a tro in federal court in the central district of california that suspended the backcharges and preserved avista energy s  letter of credit posted to the calpx for assurance of performance  on march   the court issued a preliminary injunction that continued the relief granted by the tro and required the escrowing of amounts received by the calpx 
avista energy joined in a group of nine complainants to file with the ferc to take action to declare the backcharge practices to be contrary to the tariff s avista corporation purpose  to declare the backcharges to be inoperable because of the removal of the sce and pg e contracts  and to invoke jurisdiction over the calpx in winding up its affairs 
the court action and the ferc complaint are continuing 
avista energy participated in the california power market as part of its western us business focus 
at december   avista energy had net accounts receivable of million from calpx  caliso and apx and had a special bad debt reserve of million against that amount 
avista energy received million in january and february of against the million balance  with million being due in march avista energy also has forward contracts with affiliates of sce s parent corporation  edison international eix  through its edison mission energy eme unit and with affiliates of pg es parent corporation  pg e corp 
pgc  through entities in its national energy group neg 
eix and pgc have taken steps collectively referred to as ring fencing to protect eme and neg  respectively  and their subsidiaries from creditors of their utility business units  sce and pg e  respectively 
the cpuc and certain customer groups have initiated investigations into the transactions between regulated units of eix and pgc and their affiliates 
avista energy is continuing to monitor the situation with respect to eme and neg counterparties and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of its positions with these entities 
avista energy does not believe these conditions will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations or its financial position 
the company s operations are exposed to risks  including legislative and governmental regulations  the price and supply of purchased power  fuel and natural gas  recovery of purchased power and purchased natural gas costs  weather conditions  availability of generation facilities  competition  technology and availability of funding 
in addition  the energy business exposes the company to the financial  liquidity  credit and commodity price risks associated with wholesale sales and purchases 
the company expects avista utilities electric and natural gas business to earn between and per share for  based on current streamflow and weather projections  anticipated purchased power prices and the continued ability to defer excess purchased power costs 
avista corp 
s consolidated earnings for will reflect continued support of the information and technology subsidiaries and the expectations for a reduced contribution from avista energy as it continues to manage the size and risk of the business 
consolidated earnings per share could be significantly less than the to anticipated from the avista utilities business segment 
results of operations overall operations compared to overall diluted earnings per share for were  compared to in the primary reason for the increase was earnings of million recorded by the energy trading and marketing line of business  after a loss of million in recorded by this business segment 
avista energy benefited in from a well positioned portfolio in the volatile pacific northwest and western energy markets 
the loss from avista energy in related to expenses associated with the downsizing and restructuring of the business  as well as operational losses 
the positive earnings from avista energy in were partially offset by losses from the other lines of business 
in february  the company converted all the remaining outstanding shares of its series l preferred stock back into common stock  which resulted in a one time charge of million to preferred dividend requirements 
in addition  avista utilities operations recorded losses  which were primarily the result of significantly higher purchased power costs that were compounded by short positions related to wholesale trading activity at the utility during the second quarter of see paragraphs below for additional information about the higher energy prices and short positions 
net income available for common stock increased million in over energy trading and marketing s contribution to income available for common stock increased to million over  for earnings of per diluted share in compared to a loss of per share in  due primarily to the volatile energy market discussed above 
avista utilities contribution to income available for common stock decreased million from due to the conversion costs associated with the convertible preferred stock discussed above  higher purchased power expenses and wholesale trading activities  for a loss of per diluted share in compared to a contribution of in information and technology s contribution to income available for common stock decreased million from  for a loss of per diluted share in compared to a loss of in  as these businesses continued to grow their operations 
the contribution to income available for common stock from the avista ventures line of business decreased million in  for a loss of per avista corporation diluted share in compared to a contribution of in the earnings included transactional gains recorded by pentzer that totaled million  or per share  from the sale of two groups of portfolio companies 
total revenues increased million in over  but there were large changes within the individual lines of business 
avista utilities revenues increased  primarily due to increased prices of both electricity and natural gas 
revenues at avista energy decreased due to decreased sales volumes of electricity and natural gas from the restructuring and downsizing of the business  offset by sharply higher prices 
revenues from the information and technology companies increased to million as these companies continued to grow their businesses 
intersegment eliminations represent the transactions between avista utilities and avista energy for commodities and services 
the large increase in over was primarily due to an entire year of activity under the agency agreement whereby avista energy serves as agent for avista utilities  managing its pipeline transportation contract rights and natural gas storage assets  as well as purchasing natural gas for avista utilities retail customers 
resource costs decreased million in total 
avista utilities resource costs increased  primarily due to electric and natural gas commodity prices 
avista energy s resource costs decreased  due to decreased energy trading volumes but offset by the increased prices of commodities 
intersegment eliminations also increased due to an entire year of activity under the agency agreement between avista utilities and avista energy 
operations and maintenance  administrative and general  and depreciation and amortization expenses were all primarily impacted by the information and technology and avista ventures lines of business 
all three categories of expenses increased at the information and technology companies as they continued to grow their businesses 
all three categories of expenses decreased at the avista ventures line of business as a result of the sales of portfolio companies by pentzer during interest expense increased million in over  primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt during the year 
during  million of long term debt was issued  while million of long term debt matured and million of preferred trust securities were repurchased 
long term debt and short term borrowings outstanding at december  were million higher than at the end of income taxes increased million in over  primarily due to increased earnings recorded by the energy trading and marketing line of business and gains on the sale of the centralia power plant centralia recorded by avista utilities 
income taxes in were lower than normal primarily as a result of the operational losses and restructuring charges incurred by avista energy 
preferred stock dividend requirements increased million in over due to the conversion costs and dividends paid associated with converting the convertible preferred stock  series l  into common stock in february compared to overall diluted earnings per share for were  compared to in the primary reason for the decrease was a million after tax loss recorded by the energy trading and marketing line of business  due to a million after tax charge recorded by avista energy related to the downsizing and restructuring of the business  and million of after tax operational losses due to warmer than normal weather across the nation  soft national energy markets and a lack of volatility within those markets 
the restructuring charge includes a charge for impairment of assets from the purchase of vitol in february and reserves for severance and other related expenses 
in december  the company exchanged  shares of its common stock for shares of convertible preferred stock  series l  which resulted in an increase of million in preferred stock dividend requirements in over in addition  the utility operations recorded charges of approximately million related to the impairment of utility assets  which were partially offset by the reversal of certain environmental reserves 
these charges were partially offset by the million of transactional gains recorded by pentzer due to the sales of two groups of portfolio companies 
net income available for common stock decreased million in from avista utilities income available for common stock decreased million from due to the increased preferred stock dividend associated with the convertible preferred stock  contributing per diluted share for  compared to in energy trading and marketing s income available for common stock decreased million from  for a loss of per diluted share in  as compared to a contribution of per share in  due primarily to the restructuring charges and operational losses discussed above 
information and technology s income available avista corporation for common stock decreased million from  for a loss of per share in  compared to a loss of in  due primarily to continued start up and expansion costs 
income available for common stock from the avista ventures line of business increased million in and contributed to diluted earnings per share in  compared to per share in transactional gains recorded by pentzer totaled million  or per share  and million  or per share  in and  respectively 
total revenues increased billion in over  primarily due to the growth of avista energy s business as a result of its acquisition of vitol 
resource costs increased billion  again primarily as a result of the growth in avista energy s business 
intersegment eliminations represent the transactions between avista utilities and avista energy for commodities and services 
the large increase in over was primarily due to an agreement whereby avista energy serves as agent for avista utilities  managing its pipeline transportation and natural gas storage assets  as well as purchasing natural gas for avista utilities retail customers 
gross margins for avista utilities decreased million primarily due to larger increases in purchased power costs than in the associated wholesale revenues 
avista energy s gross margin decreased million to a negative million  primarily due to losses on positions taken in anticipation of certain weather patterns in particular areas of the country which did not occur 
operations and maintenance expenses decreased million  primarily due to decreased expenses as a result of the sales of portfolio companies by pentzer 
administrative and general expenses decreased million primarily due to decreased expenses as a result of the sales of portfolio companies by pentzer  partially offset by increased salary expenses from the growth in avista energy s business and the purchase of vitol  which added significantly to staffing levels  and increased start up costs at the information and technology companies 
interest expense decreased million in  as compared to  primarily due to lower levels of outstanding debt during the year 
during  million of long term debt was issued  while million of long term debt matured or was redeemed 
at december   million of notes payable were outstanding  compared to no balances at december  long term debt outstanding at december  was million lower than at the end of income taxes decreased million  or  in from  primarily due to losses and restructuring charges incurred by the energy trading and marketing line of business  which were partially offset by higher taxes resulting from the transactional gains from the sales of the portfolio companies by pentzer 
preferred stock dividend requirements increased million in over due to the exchange of shares of common stock for shares of convertible preferred stock  series l  which occurred in december and the redemption of the final million of preferred stock  series i in june avista utilities compared to avista utilities pre tax income from operations was million in  or a decrease of million from the loss resulted primarily from significantly higher electric energy prices in wholesale markets  compounded by a short position related to wholesale trading activity 
the results for include a million after tax gain recorded as a result of the sale of its interest in centralia 
the balance of the total after tax gain of million from the sale of centralia was deferred and has been or will be returned to avista utilities customers through rates 
avista utilities operating revenues and expenses increased million and million  respectively  in over during  avista utilities purchased energy in order to meet system obligations to serve retail and wholesale customers 
unprecedented sustained peaks in electric energy prices throughout the wscc beginning in may  compounded by a wholesale short position discussed below  contributed to significant losses recorded by avista utilities in the second quarter of the cost of these power purchases was significantly higher than the amounts currently being recovered from customers 
the increased purchased power prices caused a reduction in gross margin of approximately million in from based on historical trends  avista utilities business plan had forecast on peak power prices of approximately per megawatthour for may and june of on peak power costs in the market averaged per megawatthour in may and over per megawatthour in june  with hourly spikes as high as  per megawatthour 
avista corporation on august   the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc approved avista utilities request for deferred accounting treatment for certain power costs related to increases in short term power prices beginning july  and ending june  the specific power costs deferred include the changes in power costs to avista utilities from those included in base retail rates  related to three power cost components the net effect of changes in short term wholesale market prices on short term wholesale purchases and sales  the effect on power costs from changes in the level of hydroelectric generation  and the net effect on power costs from changes in the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices 
the deferrals each month are calculated as the difference between the actual costs to avista utilities associated with these three power cost components  and the level of costs included in avista utilities base retail rates 
the power costs deferred are related solely to the operation of avista utilities system resources to serve its system retail and wholesale load obligations 
on january   the wutc approved a modification to the deferral mechanism to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  effective december  the wutc also required avista utilities to file a proposal by mid march that will address the prudency of the incurred power costs  the optimization of company owned resources to the benefit of retail customers  the appropriateness of recovery of power costs through a deferral mechanism  a proposal for cost of capital offsets to recognize the shift in risk from shareholders to ratepayers and avista utilities plan to mitigate the deferred power costs 
avista utilities also plans to file for an extension of this deferred accounting treatment beyond june on january   avista utilities filed an application with the idaho public utilities commission ipuc seeking proposed modifications to the existing power cost adjustment pca mechanism 
due to extremely high short term power prices  avista utilities is requesting to recover power supply costs associated with meeting increased retail and wholesale system load requirements  as well as to recover replacement power costs associated with possible thermal plant forced outages 
during  avista utilities deferred million in power costs in washington and million in idaho under the pca mechanism currently in place 
based on avista utilities views of streamflows  historic market prices and energy availability in the second quarter of  avista utilities entered into contracts and sold call options for fixed price power for delivery through the remainder of  without making matching purchases at the same time  and also made certain short term sales at fixed prices which were offset by purchases at prices indexed to the market price at the time of delivery 
certain of these wholesale trading positions were outside normal operating guidelines 
avista utilities was required to buy additional power not only to meet its obligations to its retail and long term wholesale customers  as described above  but also to cover its wholesale trading positions 
an orderly process to complete the necessary power purchases was impeded by the rapid escalation of market prices and lack of liquidity in the power markets 
these purchases were made at fixed prices significantly higher than the related selling prices and at index  which settled at unprecedented levels in june 
the pricing of these purchases caused the majority of avista utilities loss for the second quarter 
avista utilities short position was compounded by the may sale of its interest in centralia  which reduced its system capacity by megawatts 
based on historical trends and avista utilities views on power prices and availability of power for may and june  avista utilities did not seek to replace the centralia generation for those two months with firm commitments 
avista utilities entered into a three and one half year contract to purchase megawatts from transalta beginning in july on september   the wutc ordered a million  or  reduction in electric rates and a million  or  increase in natural gas rates 
avista utilities had filed a request with the wutc in october for a general electric rate increase of million  or  subsequently revised to million  and a general natural gas rate increase of million  or 
the wutc also ordered that avista utilities annual rate of return on investment for both electricity and natural gas be reduced from to 
avista utilities had requested a rate of return 
avista utilities filed a petition for reconsideration before the wutc requesting that the commission reconsider certain portions of its order 
on november   the commission slightly modified the original order by reducing the electric reduction from million to million and increasing the natural gas increase from million to million 
retail electric revenues increased million in over due primarily to increased prices  as well as greater sales volumes due to customer growth and increased usage due to weather 
wholesale electric revenues increased million  or  while sales volumes decreased in compared to  reflecting average sales prices higher in wholesale sales volumes decreased due to management s decision in mid year to reduce power imbalance volume limits the difference between projected load obligations and projected resource availability  based on the emergent market price volatility  and to focus primarily on energy transactions necessary avista corporation to efficiently manage power resources to meet retail customer loads and wholesale obligations 
the extent of future wholesale transactions will be determined based on resource additions or changes and load obligations and contract commitments 
wholesale transactions continue to be an integral tool in efficiently managing and economically dispatching avista utilities power resource availability to meet supply obligations within the coordinated pacific northwest power grid 
natural gas revenues increased million in over retail natural gas revenues increased million  primarily due to increased natural gas prices  but were offset by a million decrease in non retail sales 
non retail natural gas sales are sales of natural gas commodity and related services outside of the avista utilities distribution system to other utilities and large industrial customers 
revenues from these sales are offset by like increases in purchased gas expense  and margins from these transactions are credited back to retail customers through rate changes approved by state regulators for the cost of natural gas 
non retail sales have decreased since mid primarily due to the agency agreement between avista utilities and avista energy mentioned above 
avista energy will make the majority of these sales in the future  if it is optimal to managing the natural gas portfolio 
the utility commissions of washington  idaho and oregon have approved benchmark incentive mechanisms that allow avista utilities and its customers to share some of the benefits of avista energy s resource optimization activities 
purchased power volumes were lower in primarily due to decreased wholesale sales  but purchased power prices averaged higher  resulting in a million  or  increase in purchased power expense in over the million deferral of power costs pursuant to the wutc accounting order and the million deferred under the idaho pca partially offset purchased power expense recognized in streamflows in were of normal compared to in fuel for power generation expense increased million due to increased generation at the thermal plants as a result of increased demand for power and increases in natural gas commodity prices 
purchased natural gas costs increased million in  primarily due to increased prices for the commodity  increased volumes of sales due to customer growth and increased usage due to weather 
operations and maintenance expenses increased million  or  due to a variety of items  including increased distribution expenses  higher fees associated with the increased amount of customer accounts receivables sold  increased accruals for uncollectible accounts and other expenses related to customer accounting services 
compared to avista utilities pre tax income from operations decreased million in from operating revenues and expenses increased million and million  respectively  during retail electric revenues increased million due to increased kwh sales of due to customer growth of and slightly cooler weather in avista utilities service area in than in wholesale electric revenues increased million  primarily due to prices greater and sales volumes higher in over natural gas revenues decreased million primarily as a result of decreased non retail sales  partially offset by increased retail sales due to customer growth and increased customer usage as a result of slightly cooler weather in avista utilities service area in purchased power volumes increased and prices were higher than the previous year  which resulted in a million  or  increase in purchased power expense in over this increase accounted for the majority of the increase in avista utilities operating expenses 
operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in from as a result of fewer storms  resulting in less storm damage  and realizing the benefit of preventive maintenance programs such as cable replacement  pole test and treat  and tree trimming 
administrative and general expenses decreased million due to increased expenditures during associated with the change in executive officers and the corporate name change 
avista utilities also recorded charges of approximately million related to impairment of assets  which primarily included items such as deferred charges now deemed unrecoverable through rates and a defective inventory software system 
energy trading and marketing energy trading and marketing includes the results of avista energy  avista power  and avista steag 
avista power and avista steag operations had minimal impact on earnings in  or avista energy maintains an energy trading portfolio that it marks to fair market value on a daily basis mark to market accounting  and which may cause earnings variability in the future 
market prices are utilized in determining the value of the electric  natural gas and related derivative commodity instruments 
for longer term positions  in addition to market prices  a model based on forward price curves is also utilized

avista corporation compared to energy trading and marketing s income available for common stock for was million compared to a loss of million in avista energy s operations in were positively affected by a well positioned portfolio in the volatile pacific northwest and western electric markets 
avista energy s operations were negatively impacted by losses from the liquidation of its eastern electric book and associated operating costs to close its eastern operations in houston and boston 
in november  avista energy began redirecting its focus away from national energy trading toward a more regionally based energy trading and marketing effort in the west 
its more narrowly focused operations in the west are backed by contracts for energy commodities and by the output of specific facilities available under contracts 
the change in strategy followed significant changes in the overall energy trading and marketing industry that created low margins while requiring higher levels of investment  credit commitments and value at risk limits 
by late  mergers and consolidations within the industry reduced the number of firms and increased the remaining firms typical size  leaving a marketplace where liquidity and volatility were not favorable 
avista energy shut down its operations in houston and boston during the first and second quarters of and reduced its workforce by approximately positions 
the eastern electric book was sold at a million after tax loss in early the remaining eastern natural gas contracts  primarily for transportation and storage  are being managed out of the spokane office until the last of the contracts expire in energy trading and marketing s revenues and operating expenses decreased million and million  respectively  in from the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes  partially offset by increased prices 
the decreased expenses primarily resulted from decreased volumes of transactions  partially offset by increased resource costs due to increased commodity prices  and the closure of avista energy s eastern operations and refocusing the business to the west 
the volume of power and natural gas sales decreased significantly as avista energy s focus was redirected to the wscc 
electric sales volumes decreased  while natural gas sales decreased 
the exception to this was the comparatively minor coal sales  which increased in volume in over however  after the houston and boston offices were closed  no more coal sales were made and the remaining contracts expired by the end of  so there will be no more coal sales or revenues to the future 
energy trading and marketing s balance sheet increased billion from december to december avista energy s energy commodity assets and liabilities increased primarily as a result of significant price increases for both natural gas and power during this period 
trade receivables and payables increased due to higher market prices on current positions 
compared to energy trading and marketing income available for common stock for was an after tax loss of million compared to earnings of million in the primary reason for the decrease was a million after tax charge recorded by avista energy related to the downsizing and restructuring of the business  and million of after tax operational losses due to warmer than normal weather across the nation  soft national energy markets and a lack of volatility within those markets 
the restructuring charge consisted of a million after tax charge for the write off of goodwill from the purchase of vitol in february and a million after tax reserve for severance payments and other related expenses 
avista energy recognized losses on positions taken in anticipation of certain weather patterns in particular areas of the country  which lost value when the expected patterns did not occur  and on options  also taken in anticipation of certain weather patterns in particular areas of the country  which expired unexercised when the expected patterns did not occur 
since its inception in  avista energy developed and expanded its business and added experienced traders and staff 
this growth continued in with avista energy s purchase of vitol in the first quarter 
vitol  located in boston  massachusetts  was one of the top energy marketing companies in the united states 
late in the second quarter of  avista energy added a significant number of energy professionals in its spokane and houston offices 
the integration of vitol operations into avista energy began during the second quarter with the consolidation of back office support  improvements in accounting and trading processes and personnel  and continued enhancements in risk management systems across avista energy

in august  the company announced a dividend restructuring plan that reduced the company s annual common stock dividend from per share to per share  a reduction  which was effective with the payment of the common stock dividend paid on december  at the same time  an exchange offer was made whereby shareholders were provided the opportunity to exchange their shares of common stock for depositary shares  also known as recons return enhanced convertible securities 
each recons represented a one tenth ownership interest in one share of mandatorily convertible series l preferred stock 
each recons paid an annual dividend of for a period of about three years and after three years would automatically convert back to common stock  unless the company exercised its option to convert the series l preferred stock prior to the end of the three year period 
shareholders who chose not to participate in the exchange offer retained their ownership in avista corp 
common stock 
the annual savings resulting from the dividend restructuring were approximately million for the periods that the preferred stock was outstanding  increasing to about million annually after the conversion of the preferred shares back to common stock 
the savings assisted in funding a portion of the company s capital expenditures  maturing long term debt and preferred stock sinking fund requirements 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information about the convertible preferred stock 
on february   the company exercised its option to convert all the remaining outstanding shares of series l preferred stock back into common stock 
the recons were also converted into common stock on the same conversion date  and each of the recons was converted into the following shares of common stock  representing the optional conversion price  plus shares of common stock  representing the optional conversion premium  plus the right to receive in cash  representing an amount equivalent to accumulated and unpaid dividends up until  but excluding  the conversion date 
cash payments were made in lieu of fractional shares 
in march  the company began issuing new shares of common stock to the employee investment plan rather than the plan purchasing shares of common stock on the open market

the combined repurchases of these two securities represent of outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents 
there was no activity under this plan during the company funds capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates annually 
cash provided by operating activities remains the company s primary source of funds for operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures 
the company s cash flows have been affected because of the higher power and natural gas costs  as well as cash collateral required for counterparties and trading at avista energy 
the higher power and natural gas prices are expected to continue to affect cash flows during the purchased power and natural gas costs incurred to serve the utility s retail customers are generally recovered or expected to be recovered in retail rates  however  there is a lag between the time the costs are incurred by the company and the time they are collected from customers 
as more fully described in note of notes to the financial statements power cost deferrals and power and natural gas adjustment provisions  costs in excess of those included in rates are deferred as an asset on the balance sheet 
deferral balances at the end of totaled million 
costs during are expected to continue to exceed the levels included in rates and  as a result  deferral balances are expected to increase during because of the continuing high level of power and natural gas prices  a significant change in company resource availability such as hydro generation or customer demand could have a significant positive or negative impact on expected deferrals and cash flows 
on an interim basis  the company uses its revolving line of credit to fund these costs to the extent that they exceed the cash flows available from operations 
the company expects to issue longer term debt during to pay down balances outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
this will provide additional liquidity needed to fund the deferral balances 
the company intends to file applications with regulatory commissions during to address timing of recovery of the deferred costs 
if the commissions approve the company s requests  the deferral balances are expected to begin being recovered starting in or the company s existing lines of credit are expected to be adequate to meet the current needs 
under normal water conditions and loads  avista utilities own generation plants and long term contracts would be able to provide approximately of its forecasted native load energy requirements in  and thereof in and the balance would be covered through short term contracts 
avista utilities has covered essentially all of its electric energy requirements in the forward markets for current forecasts show streamflow conditions for hydroelectric generation for  estimated at of normal  to be among the worst five years on record 
in response to the reduced hydroelectric generation  avista utilities has made additional fixed price purchases of energy  and expects to receive the necessary local  state and federal approvals to increase the energy output of its natural gas fired thermal generation to cover its firm retail and wholesale load requirements for  with minimal additional purchases expected from the high cost short term wholesale market 
however  if hydroelectric conditions further deteriorate  its thermal plants do not operate as planned  or weather conditions cause retail loads to increase  avista utilities would incur increased costs from increased purchases in the short term wholesale energy market 
higher volatility in in power and natural gas prices and significant increases in average price levels have resulted in the need for energy trading counterparties to provide one another adequate assurances of their future performance on energy transaction obligations 
the adequate assurance demands are satisfied through various means  including letters of credit  cash deposits or prepayments  parent entity guaranties  contract terms and portfolio management 
as mentioned earlier  the company is currently in the process of obtaining separate financing for construction of the coyote springs project 
the company is seeking to finance a majority of the costs during construction with a term loan that would match the construction period 
the project would serve as collateral for the term loan 
if the company does not complete a separate financing for this project  there would be a need to issue other debt or equity securities during and to provide the funding 
the california energy crisis discussed earlier has had an impact on banks willingness to extend credit to energy and utility companies 
banks are particularly concerned with the credit of companies in california and those in the west with exposure to california or the potential to be impacted by what ultimately happens in california 
this may impact avista corporation the company s ability to obtain financing from traditional sources 
however  the company currently expects that it will be able to obtain financing required to meet its capital and operating needs on reasonable terms 
capital expenditures are financed on an interim basis with short term borrowings or notes payable due within one year

as of december   avista capital had loaned million to avista energy to support its short term cash and collateral needs 
these loans are subordinate to any obligations to the banks under the credit agreements 
rising prices in power and natural gas beginning in the second quarter of and continuing beyond the end of triggered additional collateral requirements with counterparties 
avista energy is managing the collateral calls by providing letters of credit  providing guarantees from avista capital and offsetting transactions with counterparties 
in addition to the letters of credit and other items included above  cash deposited with counterparties totaled million as of december   and is included in the consolidated balance sheets in prepayments and other 
the posted collateral will be returned to avista energy depending on the effect of changing market values of forward contracts or as forward positions settle 
avista energy held cash deposits from other parties in the amount of million as of december   and such amounts are subject to refund if conditions warrant because of continuing portfolio value fluctuations with those parties

the capital expenditures are expected to be million  and million in debt maturities will also occur 
during the next three years  internally generated cash and other debt obligations are expected to provide the majority of the funds for these capital expenditure requirements 
the decrease in these projected capital expenditures is primarily related to the change in pentzer s focus beginning in at december   this line of business had million in cash and cash equivalents and temporary investments  with million in long term debt outstanding

the capital expenditures by avista capital includes funding of coyote springs  which will be transferred to avista utilities 
funding of avista capital by avista corp 
includes both equity investments and notes payable 
the company s total common equity increased million to million at the end of the increase was primarily due to the conversion of convertible preferred stock into common stock and the earnings recorded by avista energy 
the company s consolidated capital structure at december   was debt  preferred securities including the preferred trust securities and common equity as compared to debt  preferred securities including the preferred trust securities and common equity at year end had the convertible preferred stock been converted into common stock  the company s consolidated capital structure at december   would have been debt  preferred securities including the preferred trust securities and common equity 
additional financial data at december   the total long term debt of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries  as shown in the company s consolidated financial statements  was approximately million 
of such amount  million represents long term unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the company  and million represents secured indebtedness of the company 
the balance of million represents indebtedness of subsidiaries 
consolidated long term debt does not include the company s subordinated indebtedness held by the issuers of company obligated preferred trust securities 
an additional million of the company s short term debt outstanding under or backed by the committed lines of credit is secured 
future outlook business strategy avista corporation avista utilities seeks to maintain a strong  low cost utility business focused on delivering efficient  reliable and high quality service to its customers 
the utility business is expected to grow modestly  consistent with historical trends 
expansion will primarily result from economic growth in its service territory 
avista energy scaled back operations to the wscc during  and will continue to focus on reducing the size and the risk associated with its energy trading and marketing activities 
avista energy s marketing efforts are expected to be driven by its base of knowledge and experience in the operation of both electric energy and natural gas physical systems in the region  as well as its relationship focused approach to its customers 
avista power will continue to pursue opportunities to develop new generation to support the growing power requirements in the northwest 
the company also intends to focus on its investments in the information and technology subsidiaries as part of its overall plans for generating shareholder value  which could include finding equity partners to assist in financing the continued growth of the businesses 
competition avista utilities competes to provide service to new retail electric customers with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to its service territories 
alternate sources of power may compete for sales to existing avista utilities customers  including new market entrants as a result of deregulation 
competition for available electric resources has become more critical to utilities as surplus power resources have been absorbed by load growth 
avista utilities natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources but natural gas continues to maintain a price advantage compared to heating oil  propane and other fuels  provided that the natural gas distribution system is proximate to prospective customers 
the avista capital subsidiaries  particularly the information and technology companies  are subject to competition as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies in these emerging industries may mean challenges for a company to be the first to market a new product or service to gain the advantage in market share 
in order for these new businesses to grow as planned  one significant challenge will be the availability of funding and resources to meet the capital needs 
other challenges will be rapidly advancing technologies  possibly making some of the current technology quickly obsolete  and requiring continual research and development for product advancement 
in order for some of these subsidiaries to succeed  they will need to reduce costs of these emerging technologies to make them affordable to future customers 
business risk the company s operations are exposed to risks  including legislative and governmental regulations  the price and supply of purchased power  fuel and natural gas  recovery of purchased power and purchased natural gas costs  weather conditions  availability of generation facilities  competition  technology and availability of funding 
challenges facing avista utilities electric operations include  among other things  changes in the availability of and volatility in the prices of power and fuel  generating unit availability  legislative and governmental regulations  weather conditions  and the ability to recover increased costs of purchased power 
avista utilities believes it faces minimal risk for stranded utility assets resulting from deregulation due to its low cost generation portfolio and because of the slower and more cautious approach to regulatory changes that have been under consideration in washington and idaho 
in a deregulated environment  however  evolving technologies that provide alternate energy supplies could affect the market price of power  and certain generating assets could have capital and operating costs above the adjusted market price 
in addition  the energy trading and marketing business exposes the company to the financial  liquidity  credit and commodity price risks associated with wholesale sales and purchases 
natural gas commodity prices increased dramatically during however  market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for residential  commercial and industrial customers 
proven reserves and future natural gas development opportunities lead the company to believe that natural gas should sustain its market advantage 
significant growth has occurred in the natural gas business in recent years due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction 
challenges facing avista utilities natural gas operations include  among other things  volatility in the price of natural gas  changes in the availability of natural gas  legislative and governmental regulations  weather conditions  conservation and the timing for recovery of increased commodity supply costs 
avista utilities natural gas business also faces the potential for large natural gas customers to by pass its natural gas system 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  avista utilities prices its natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price its transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
avista utilities has long term transportation contracts with seven of avista corporation its largest industrial customers  which reduces the risks of these customers by passing the system in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk 
both avista utilities and avista energy are subject to commodity price risk 
historically  the price of power in wholesale markets has been affected primarily by production costs and by other factors including streamflows  the availability of hydro and thermal generation and transmission capacity  weather and the resulting retail loads  and the price of coal  natural gas and oil to thermal generating units 
any combination of these factors that resulted in a shortage of energy generally caused the market price of power to move upward 
now  however  market prices appear to be affected by other factors as well 
these factors include the gradual elimination of excess generating capacity in the wscc and the effects of the restructuring of the electric utility business at the state and federal levels and the deregulation of wholesale energy markets 
price risk is  in general  the risk of fluctuation in the market price of the commodity needed  held or traded 
in the case of electricity  price movements are correlated to adequacy of generating reserve margins  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric production  the price of thermal generating plant fuel  and disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities 
demand changes caused by variations in the weather and other factors are also correlated to price movements 
price risk also includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments such as options and forward contracts 
price risk may also be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
as discussed earlier  market prices for power and natural gas in the western us and western canada were significantly higher in than at any time in history  with unprecedented levels of volatility 
the extreme price volatility experienced in suggests that other factors  including unexplained influences  also affect market prices 
credit risk 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that avista utilities and or avista energy would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to deliver energy and make financial settlements 
credit risk includes not only the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances which relate to other market participants which have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
avista utilities and avista energy seek to mitigate credit risk by applying specific eligibility criteria to existing and prospective counterparties and by actively monitoring current credit exposures 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties occur from time to time 
avista energy has experienced payment receipt defaults from certain parties impacted by the california energy crisis and ultimate collection is not known at this time 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant changes in energy markets california energy crisis and note of notes to financial statements for more information about credit reserves 
credit risk also involves the exposure that counterparties perceive related to performance by avista utilities and avista energy to perform deliveries and settlement of energy resource transactions 
these counterparties seek assurance of performance in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits  and  in the case of avista energy  parent company performance guaranties 
in periods of price volatility  the level of exposure can change significantly  with the result that sudden and significant demands may be made against the company s capital resource reserves credit facilities and cash 
other operating risks 
in addition to commodity price risk  avista utilities commodity positions are also subject to operational and event risks including  among others  increases in load demand  transmission or transport disruptions  fuel quality specifications and forced outages at generating plants 
some of these factors have been addressed in the recent changes to the washington deferred power accounting adjustment and the idaho pca 
interest rate risk 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business 
the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio and the fair value of notes payable at december  approximated carrying value 
given the short term nature of these instruments  market risk  as measured by the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates  is immaterial 
the company manages interest rate risk by taking advantage of market conditions when timing the issuance of long term financings and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
a portion of the company s capitalization consists of floating rate pollution control bonds  of which the interest rate resets periodically  and company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred trust securities  of which the interest portion of the million series b resets on a quarterly basis  both reflecting current market avista corporation conditions 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an immaterial change in the company s cash flows related to the increased interest expense associated with these floating rate securities 
foreign currency risk 
the company has investments in several canadian companies through avista energy canada  ltd 
and its acquisition of coast pacific management  inc see note for additional information about this acquisition 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risk was immaterial to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position in and is not expected to change materially in the near future 
risk management risk policies and oversight 
avista utilities and avista energy use a variety of techniques to manage risks 
the company has established risk management oversight for these risks for each area of the company s energy related business 
the company has established a risk management committee composed of senior management separate from the units that create such risk exposure and overseen by the audit and finance committee of the company s board of directors  to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
avista utilities and avista energy have adopted policies and procedures to manage the risks  both quantitative and qualitative  inherent in their businesses 
the company s risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and monitors compliance with the company s risk management policies and procedures on a regular basis 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  and other factors may result in losses in earnings  cash flow and or fair values 
avista utilities hired williams energy marketing trading company in july to advise on risk management  risk analysis and power resource optimization issues for all system requirements 
the work was completed and the contract ended in the fourth quarter of quantitative risk measurements 
avista utilities has established volume limits for its imbalance between projected loads and resources 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
avista utilities uses the wholesale power markets to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected in the month forward planning horizon 
any imbalance is required to remain within limits  or management action or decisions are triggered to address larger imbalance situations 
volume limits for forward periods are based on monthly and quarterly averages  which may vary materially from the actual load and resource variations within any given month or operating day 
future projections of resources are updated as forecasted streamflows and other factors differ from prior estimates 
forward power markets may be illiquid  and market products may only be available to approximate avista utilities desired transaction size and shape 
therefore  open imbalance positions exist at any given time 
during  as market prices and volatility rose to unprecedented levels  the risk management committee decreased the size of avista utilities forward power imbalance limits 
avista energy measures the risk in its power and natural gas portfolio daily utilizing a value at risk var model and monitors its risk in comparison to established thresholds 
var measures the worst expected loss over a given time interval under normal market conditions at a given confidence level 
avista energy also measures its open positions in terms of volumes at each delivery location for each forward time period 
the extent of open positions is included in the risk management policy and is measured with stress tests and var modeling 
the risk management committee adopted a revised avista energy risk policy in early to reflect the change in focus from a national operation to the western energy markets 
the revised risk policy also reduced targeted levels of risk compared to the prior policy 
the var computations are based on an historical simulation  which utilizes price movements over a specified period to simulate forward price curves in the energy markets to estimate the unfavorable impact of price movement in the portfolio of transactions scheduled to settle within the following eight calendar quarters 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across avista energy s continually changing portfolio 
var represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses in earnings that would be recognized on its portfolio assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
avista energy s var computations utilize several key assumptions  including a confidence level for the resultant price movement and holding periods of one and three days 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments held for trading purposes and excludes the effects of written and embedded physical options in the trading portfolio 
avista corporation at december   avista energy s estimated potential one day unfavorable impact on gross margin was million  as measured by var  related to its commodity trading and marketing business  compared to million at december  the average daily var for was million  compared to million in  primarily due to avista energy s restructuring 
changes in markets inconsistent with historical trends or assumptions used could cause actual results to exceed predicted limits 
market risks associated with derivative commodity instruments held for purposes other than trading were not material at december  for forward transactions that would settle beyond the immediate eight calendar quarters  avista energy applies other risk measurement techniques  including price sensitivity stress tests  to assess the future market risk 
volatility in longer dated forward markets tends to be significantly less than near term markets 
economic and load growth avista utilities expects economic growth to continue in its eastern washington and northern idaho service area 
avista utilities  along with others in the service area  is continuing its efforts to facilitate expansion of existing businesses and attract new businesses to the inland northwest 
although agriculture  mining and lumber were the primary industries for many years  today health care  education  electronic and other manufacturing  tourism and the service sectors are becoming increasingly important industries that operate in avista utilities service area 
avista utilities also anticipates moderate economic growth to continue in its oregon service area 
avista utilities anticipates residential and commercial electric load growth to average approximately annually for the next five years  primarily due to increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the number of electric customers is expected to increase and the average annual usage by residential customers is expected to remain steady 
a public utility regulatory policies act of purpa contract with avista utilities largest customer expires in the customer is expected to self generate at that time  which will reduce the load to this customer by the amount avista utilities has been purchasing and then reselling to them 
avista utilities anticipates natural gas load growth  including transportation volumes  in its washington and idaho service area to average approximately annually for the next five years 
the oregon and south lake tahoe  california service areas are anticipated to realize growth annually during that same period 
the anticipated natural gas load growth is primarily due to expected conversions from electric space and water heating to natural gas  and increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory 
the forward looking projections set forth above regarding retail sales growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail sales growth are also based upon various assumptions including  without limitation  assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns and internal business plans  and an assumption that avista utilities will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in the underlying assumptions can cause actual experience to vary significantly from forward looking projections 
environmental issues since december  a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act esa 
thus far  measures which have been adopted and implemented to save the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of avista utilities hydroelectric dams 
avista utilities does  however  purchase power from four projects on the columbia river that are being directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on avista utilities at this time 
it is currently not possible to accurately predict the likely economic costs to the company resulting from all future actions 
the company received a new ferc operating license for the cabinet gorge and noxon rapids hydroelectric projects on february  that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement reached with signatories 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  in particular bull trout  is a principal focus of the agreement 
bull trout are native to this area and were listed as threatened in under the esa 
a collaborative bull trout recovery program with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana is underway on the lower clark fork river 
the new ferc license establishes a plan for bull trout restoration  including annual budget estimates 
avista corporation the company continues to study the issue of high dissolved gas levels downstream of cabinet gorge during spill periods  as agreed to in the settlement agreement for relicensing of cabinet gorge 
to date  intensive biological studies in the lower clark fork river and lake pend oreille have documented minimal biological effects of high dissolved gas levels on free ranging fish 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will develop an abatement and or mitigation strategy in see note of notes to financial statements for additional information 
lake coeur d alene decision on july   the united states district court for the district of idaho issued its finding that the coeur d alene tribe of idaho owns portions of the bed and banks of lake coeur d alene and the st 
joe river lying within the current boundaries of the coeur d alene reservation 
the disputed bed and banks comprise approximately the southern one third of lake coeur d alene 
this action had been brought by the united states on behalf of the tribe against the state of idaho 
while the company is not a party to this action  which has been appealed by the state of idaho to the ninth circuit court of appeals  the company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of this decision on the operation of its hydroelectric facilities on the spokane river  downstream of lake coeur d alene 
the state of idaho filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court  which petition was granted 
the company expects that the matter will be heard and decided by july other the board of directors considers the level of dividends on the company s common stock on a continuing basis  taking into account numerous factors including  without limitation  the company s results of operations and financial condition  as well as general economic and competitive conditions 
the company s net income available for dividends is derived from avista utilities operations
