during the fiscal year ended march   the company exited all outlying retail mortgage and construction markets and as a result  the community bank recognized a related one time pre tax charge of  the initiative to discontinue these product lines in outlying markets will enable the company to focus on its metropolitan atlanta franchise and to emphasize deposit relationships with its loan customers thereby potentially reducing the cost of funds 
in conjunction with the company s decision to exit its lending activities in outlying markets  the community bank subsequently decided to sell  in non accrual single family residential loans  the majority of which were originated outside of metropolitan atlanta

the loans sold consisted primarily of first mortgage loans on single family residences that were originated between and  and represented percent of the  in loans originated by the company during that time period 
because of collateral coverage and mortgage insurance  management historically has been able to minimize losses from delinquent single family mortgages

during the year ended march   management analyzed the efficiencies of each mortgage loan function and eliminated excess staff 
the company also consolidated many functions to achieve lower break even levels for each office 
after further evaluation of various alternatives to improve profitability  management recommended and the board of directors approved the exit of all lending activities outside of metropolitan atlanta 
the company recorded restructuring charges associated with the sale of it wholesale lending operation of  and  related to exiting outlying retail mortgage markets 
these charges included employee severance and termination costs  leasehold and other contract termination cost  asset impairment costs and transaction fees

interest rate and market risk the normal course of business activity exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset and liability framework for the company 
the principal objectives of asset and liability management are to guide the sensitivity of net interest spreads to potential changes in interest rates and to enhance profitability in ways that promise sufficient reward for recognized and controlled risk 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
the company employs sensitivity analysis in the form of a net interest income simulation to help characterize the market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
in addition  fluctuations in interest rates usually result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the company s interest rate risk position is managed by alco 
alco s objective is to optimize the company s financial position  liquidity and net interest income  while remaining within the board of director s approved limits 
the company uses a simulation modeling process to measure interest rate risk and evaluate potential strategies 
the company s net interest income simulation includes all financial assets and liabilities 
this simulation measures both the term risk and basis risk in the company s assets and liabilities 
the simulation also captures the option characteristics of products  such as caps and floors on floating rate loans  the right to pre pay mortgage loans without penalty and the ability of customers to withdraw deposits on demand 
these options are modeled through the use of primarily historical customer behavior and statistical analysis 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth  asset and liability mix  pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheets 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
simulation results quantify interest rate risk under various interest rate scenarios 
management then develops and implements appropriate strategies 
the board of directors regularly reviews the overall interest rate risk position and asset and liability management strategies 
the company uses three standard scenarios rates unchanged  rising rates  and declining rates in analyzing interest rate sensitivity 
the rising and declining rate scenarios cover a basis points upward and downward rate ramp 
the company closely monitors each scenario to manage interest rate risk 
management estimates the company s annual net interest income would increase approximately  or percent  and decrease approximately  or percent in the rising and declining rate scenarios  respectively  versus the projection under unchanged rates 
a fair market value analysis of the company s balance sheet calculated under an instantaneous basis point increase in rates over march   estimates a  or percent decrease in market value 
the company estimates a like decrease in rates would decrease market value  or percent 
these simulated computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
in fiscal  the company will continue to face term risk and basis risk and may be confronted with several risk scenarios 
if interest rates rise  net interest income may actually increase if deposit rates lag increases in market rates 
the company could  however  experience significant pressure on net interest income if there is a substantial increase in deposit rates relative to market rates 
a declining interest rate environment might result in a decrease in loan rates  while deposit rates remain relatively stable which could also create significant risk to net interest income

the bank s alco has primary responsibility for managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
alco s subcommittee  the pricing committee  meets weekly to establish interest rates on loans and deposits and review interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period of time is commonly referred to as gap 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities  a negative gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over interest rate sensitive assets 
the company s gap position is evaluated and reviewed continuously 
the company has a negative one year gap of percent as of march  the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at march  the gap analysis is prepared using either actual repricing intervals or maturity dates when stated

in keeping with the company s strategic plan to exit outlying mortgage and construction lending markets  the company s construction loan and acquisition and development loan portfolio shrank 
in fiscal  it is the company s intent to grow its commercial loan portfolio and to continue to grow its portfolio of home equity loans 
in addition  the company intends to increase the non residential real estate mortgage portfolio slightly during the upcoming year  while maintaining the residential first mortgage loan portfolio at substantially the same level 
in accordance with the company s business plan  the volume of construction and acquisition and development lending increased over the previous four years 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company exited all construction lending markets outside of metropolitan atlanta  decreasing the level of originations and outstanding commitments in construction loans 
the company had construction loan offices in five markets outside of the metropolitan atlanta area 
the company had total commitments of approximately  in construction loans in these markets at the end of december and at march   total commitments decreased to  while it is the company s intent to increase the volume of construction and acquisition and development loans in the metropolitan atlanta area  the company expects the construction and acquisition loan portfolio to decline from the march  level 
the company understands the risks inherent in interim construction financing and has designed an efficient organization to properly mitigate those risks through strict underwriting and close monitoring of the process 
the company s underwriting criteria consider  among other things  the equity investment of the borrower  the track record and financial condition of the builder  the demand for the type of house to be constructed including a marketing survey of inventory levels of unsold homes by price range and location  the feasibility of house plans and costs  the growth prospects for the economy and the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company closely monitors construction progress and draws throughout the process 
in addition  no single customer accounted for more than percent of the company s loans in fiscal  or in  the company began a leasing operation  which purchased leases from approved lessors 
each credit was underwritten based upon the lessee s cash flow  business prospects and ability to make rental payments

management and the aqc consider numerous factors in identifying potential problem loans including  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific loan problems  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  past payment experience  general market conditions and such other factors as management or the aqc believes should be considered under existing circumstances 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments with regard to information available to them at the time of the examination 
management is not aware of any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful or substandard that i have not been disclosed and ii either a represent or result from trends or uncertainties  which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or b represent material credits in which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management believes that the bank s credit review and loan monitoring processes are adequate to evaluate and monitor these risks and that the bank s allowance for probable loan losses is adequate in relation to the composition of its loan portfolio 
although the company s non accrual loans as a percentage of loans receivable  net  plus reserves  was percent at march   there is a risk that the quality of the company s loan portfolio could decline 
construction and acquisition and development loans comprise the largest component of the company s loan portfolio 
construction loans frequently involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans principally due to i the potential risks associated with securing permanent financing  and ii general market conditions in the housing industry 
management and the aqc  along with regulators  closely monitor total exposure to each market area and price range in determining the appropriate concentrations of construction loans 
the office of thrift supervision the ots also monitors and comments on the adequacy of the bank s provision for loan losses in conducting its examinations of the bank 
non performing assets historically  loans were placed on non accrual when payments have been in default for days 
during fiscal  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  the company elected to change the method used from number of days in default to number of payments missed when placing amortizing real estate loans on non accrual 
this change provides a more consistent method for placing loans on non accrual by eliminating the volatility associated with the number of days in each month 
real estate loans are now placed on non accrual when four payments are missed 
all prior periods presented have been restated to reflect this change in method 
at march   the company had non accrual loans of  compared to  at march  interest income not recognized on non accrual loans amounted to  during and  during at march    or percent of the non accrual loans were mortgage loans secured by residential real estate

non accrual construction and acquisition and development loans grew to  or percent at march   from  or percent at march  the non accrual construction and acquisition and development loans at march  are attributable to five relationships 
three of these borrowers are located outside of the metropolitan atlanta area in lending markets the bank exited during the fourth quarter of fiscal the board of directors established a strategic task force to evaluate the future business focus of the company and to ensure that the company was prepared for a softening economy 
this task force evaluated the asset quality and allowance for loan loss adequacy at the bank  including the level of problem assets 
the task force presented a plan to the board in december that included the exit of the retail mortgage operation and a strong recommendation that the bank negotiate a sale of certain non accrual single family real estate mortgages related to the retail mortgage portfolio 
the board did not approve the sale of loans at that time and management consequently recommended recognition of impairment by specific addition to the provision 
a final sales contract was presented to the board of directors in its february meeting and approved 
the sale was completed on february  and a loss of  was charged to the allowance for loan losses

impaired loans exclude residential mortgages  construction loans secured by first mortgage liens  and groups of small homogeneous loans 
specific allowances for loan losses are allocated for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price  or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
at march  and  the valuation allowance related to these impaired loans was  and  respectively  which is included in the allowance for loan losses as presented in the following tables

the company uses either the cash or cost recovery method to record cash receipts on impaired loans that are on non accrual 
under the cash method  contractual interest is credited to interest income when received 
this method is used when the ultimate collectibility of the total principal is not in doubt 
loans on the cost recovery method may be changed to the cash method when the application of the cash payments has reduced the principal balance to a level where collection of the remaining recorded investment is no longer in doubt 
allowance for loan losses the company set aside  and  respectively  of additional allowances for probable loan losses during the years ended march  and approximately  of this provision charge was taken as a specific reserve to reflect impairment of a portfolio of non accrual residential mortgage loans with a principal balance of approximately  upon completion of the sale of these loans  a loss of  was charged to the allowance for loan losses 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition non performing assets 
in the december quarter  a strategic task force recommended that the bank exit the retail mortgage operation and construction lending activities outside the primary market of metropolitan atlanta during the march quarter 
at the time  the company had construction loan offices and residential mortgage origination offices in five markets outside of the metropolitan atlanta area 
based on the recommendation  there would no longer be loan officers in those markets to actively manage these credits  management determined that there was increased risk associated with the existing construction loans in these markets 
although construction loans are secured by real property  the nature of these loans creates greater exposure to losses in the event of foreclosure 
additional provision expense was recognized to account for the greater loss estimates on problem loans outside of metropolitan atlanta 
as a result of exiting outlying construction markets the bank evaluated the collectibility of the credits within these markets and recorded a charge to the loan loss provision of  in determining the amount of coverage adequate to absorb losses related to this portfolio  management took into consideration  among other things  the size of the portfolio  market concentrations  credit ratings in the portfolio  and specific non performing loans 
the company had approximately  in construction loans in these markets at the end of december and approximately  at march  approximately  or percent of the company s exposure in non accrual residential construction loans was outside of metropolitan atlanta at december  and  or percent at march  during the march quarter  the bank foreclosed on seven construction loans to two borrowers located in chattanooga  tennessee 
total outstanding balances on these seven loans totaled  one borrower had four construction loans totaling  and one borrower had three construction loans totaling  the bank charged off a total  related to these loans prior to transferring the properties to the real estate owned portfolio 
in addition  the bank increased the provision for loan losses during fiscal  due to an increase in charge offs 
at march   the allowance represented percent of average loans receivable  net  outstanding during the period  an increase as compared to percent at march  net charge offs in fiscal were  versus  in fiscal  an increase of percent 
without the one time charge of  taken in conjunction with the sale of the  non accrual loan portfolio discussed earlier  net charge offs in fiscal would have been  an increase of percent over fiscal in fiscal  net charge offs represented percent of average loans receivable  net  versus percent for fiscal loan loss allowance totaled  and  respectively  at march  and loan loss allowance to total problem assets increased to percent at march  compared to percent at march  non accrual loans were also on the rise at march  as compared to march  without the sale of approximately  in non accrual single family residential mortgages  non accrual real estate mortgage loans at march  would have exceeded the march  level 
as noted in the previous discussion of non performing assets  non accrual construction loans increased  also considered in management s determination of the level of allowance for loan losses  was the increase in the bank s concentration of non residential mortgage loans and home equity and second mortgages 
non residential mortgage loans and home equity and second mortgages involve greater risks than residential first mortgage loans 
at march   non residential mortgage loans and home equity and second mortgages increased  or percent to  compared to  at march  residential first mortgage loans decreased  or percent to  at march  from  at march  this change in loan concentration is reflected in the level of allowance for loan losses and in the reallocation of the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  the increased risk associated with the construction and acquisition and development loans and the increase in charge offs in consumer loans are reflected in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses  as presented in the following table 
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the probability of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
although other relevant factors are considered  the allocation is primarily based on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional allowance amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the allowance for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
management believes that the allowance for losses on loans are adequate based upon management s evaluation of  among other things  estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and composition of the company s loan portfolio

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the bank s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management alco manages the company s liquidity needs to ensure there is sufficient cash flow to satisfy demand for credit and deposit withdrawals  to fund operations and to meet other company obligations and commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
deposits provide a significant portion of the company s cash flow needs and continue to provide a relatively stable  low cost source of funds 
the company s other primary funding source is provided by advances from the federal home loan bank 
under current regulations  the bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to assure its safe and sound operation 
the requirement to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets  established by regulation  has been eliminated 
currently  there is no standard or guidelines regarding the application of the regulatory requirement 
at march   the company had commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans of approximately  with terms of up to thirty years and interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
there were no commitments to originate variable rate mortgage loans 
the company had commitments to sell mortgage loans of approximately  at march  the company is committed to loan funds on unused variable rate lines of credit of approximately  at march  in addition  the company has issued approximately  in letters of credit at march  the company s funding sources for these commitments include loan repayments  deposits and fhlb advances 
beginning april   the bank formed an operating subsidiary  prime eagle 
prime eagle generates revenues by originating permanent mortgage loans 
substantially all fixed rate permanent mortgage loans are sold to investors 
permanent mortgage loan originations decreased  or percent to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the company manages the short term funding requirements of these loans primarily with short term advances from the fhlb and deposits 
as part of the company s strategic initiative to focus on atlanta and concentrate on core banking activities  the bank will no longer originate mortgage loans though prime eagle 
the bank will continue to offer a competitive mortgage product line for its core atlanta market from the existing branch banking network 
expenses associated with mortgage origination will be reduced and the activity will no longer be a significant element of the company s performance 
cash flow from operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was  compared to  in fiscal the primary reason for this fluctuation is timing differences from the sale of loans held for sale versus origination of loans held for sale 
in fiscal  the company originated  of loans held for sale and sold  of loans held for sale 
this resulted in a  source of cash 
this compares to fiscal  when the company originated  of loans held for sale and sold  of loans held for sale  resulting in a  source of cash 
cash flow from investing activities in fiscal  cash provided by investing activities was  compared to uses of  for the prior year

cash flow from financing activities cash used from financing activities during fiscal  was  compared to cash provided of  during fiscal the decrease in proceeds from fhlb advances and other borrowings was the most significant factor

capital the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia established five capital categories for financial institutions 
the ots places each federally chartered thrift institution into one of five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
these classifications are based on the bank s level of risk based capital  leverage ratios and its supervisory ratings 
fdicia defines well capitalized banks as entities having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or higher  a tier one risk based capital ratio of percent or higher and a leveraged ratio of percent or higher 
at march   the bank was classified as well capitalized under the ots regulations that implement the fdicia provisions described above 
the bank s risk based capital ratio at march  was percent or percent above the minimum required to be considered well capitalized 
the following table reflects the bank s minimum regulatory capital requirements  actual capital and the level of excess capital by category 
the bank has historically maintained capital substantially in excess of the minimum requirement 
if necessary  to ensure the bank maintains a well capitalized status and the holding company has sufficient liquidity  the company would consider cessation of the dividend to common shareholders  participation of certain mezzanine loans  seeking additional equity partners or additional credit facilities
