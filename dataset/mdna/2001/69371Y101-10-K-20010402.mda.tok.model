item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pac west is a rapidly growing provider of integrated communications services in the western united states 
our customers include internet service providers  small and medium sized businesses and enhanced communications service providers  many of which are communications intensive users 
our predecessor  also known as pac west telecomm  inc  began selling office phone systems in and reselling long distance service to small and medium sized businesses and residential customers in beginning in  our predecessor began offering paging and telephone answering services to its customers 
effective september   our predecessor transferred its telephone and answering service divisions to us 
prior to september   we did not conduct any operations and  since that time  we have disposed of the answering service division and have focused our business strategy on operating as a provider of integrated communications services 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we acquired the customer base and certain assets of napa valley telecom napa telecom in january  acquired all of the oustanding stock of installnet  inc and two related companies collectively  installnet in february  acquired the customer base and certain assets of btc corp baron telecommunications in september  and acquired the customer base and assets of communications specialists  inc csi in november each of these acquisitions has been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
for the years ended december  and  recognizing compensation from other communications companies for completing their customers calls only to the extent such compensation was actually received in cash  or collectibility was reasonably assured  we had net revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  and adjusted ebitda of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had  lines in service  a increase from december  for the year ended december   our minutes of use were billion  an increase of over factors affecting operations revenues 
we derive our revenues from monthly recurring charges  usage charges  amortization of initial non recurring charges and telephone equipment sales and service 
monthly recurring charges include the fees paid by customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines  as well as equipment collocation services 
usage charges consist of fees paid by end users for each call made  fees paid by incumbent local exchange carriers as reciprocal compensation for completion of their customers calls through pac west  and access charges paid by carriers for long distance traffic terminated by pac west 
initial non recurring charges are paid by end users  if applicable  for the initiation of our service 
initial non recurring charges include payments received for installation services 
the company s adoption of sab changed the timing of when revenue is recognized for non refundable up front payments received for installation services 
historically  these amounts have been recognized in the period received 
under the revised revenue recognition policy  these payments  and related costs up to the amount of revenues  are recognized as revenue and expense ratably over the the term of the service contracts  generally to months 
any costs in excess of recognized revenues are expensed in the current period 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from reciprocal compensation paid by incumbent local exchange carriers with which we have interconnection agreements 
reciprocal compensation revenues increased significantly in recent fiscal quarters as a result of increasing inbound call volume from our internet service providers and other customers 
for the years ended december   and  recorded reciprocal compensation accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues 
from through  two incumbent local exchange carriers with which we have interconnection agreements  pacific bell and gte  refused to pay that portion of reciprocal compensation due under their prior agreements that they estimated was the result of inbound calls terminating to internet service providers 
these incumbent local exchange carriers contended that such internet service provider calls are not local calls within the meaning of their respective interconnection agreements and claimed that no reciprocal compensation was therefore payable 
the total reciprocal compensation withheld by pacific bell and gte and not included in revenues was million for the year ended december  pacific bell discontinued withholding amounts as of june  and gte discontinued withholdings as of october  the amounts withheld in prior to these dates aggregated million 
on september   pac west entered into a settlement agreement with pacific bell regarding all of our outstanding claims for unpaid reciprocal compensation under our prior interconnection agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  pacific bell agreed to pay million to pac west and million to certain stockholders of pac west as of the date of the recapitalization in settlement of those claims 
as a result of these payments  the terms of our september recapitalization requiring additional distributions to certain of our shareholders have been satisfied 
in october  gte paid all amounts withheld totaling  on june   the california public utilities commission adopted a decision in an arbitration proceeding between us and pacific bell which held that reciprocal compensation would be payable for internet service provider calls under our new interconnection agreement with pacific bell which became effective on june  pacific bell has paid the full amount of our billings for calls since the effective date of the new agreement 
on august   we  along with the commissioners of the california public utilities commission and others  were named as a defendant in an action filed by gte california 
the action challenges the legality of the california public utilities commission s decision regarding reciprocal compensation as discussed above 
we intend to seek dismissal of the action or otherwise contest the claims of gte california 
the obligation of gte or other local exchange carriers to pay this reciprocal compensation under its current agreement is currently under review by both state and federal regulators 
while the incumbent local exchange carriers have been paying us the full amount of our reciprocal compensation billings since the latter half of  some of these payments may be subject to a reservation of rights to appeal and incumbent local exchange carriers may contest or seek subsequent reimbursement of amounts previously paid by them for reciprocal compensation 
we expect that reciprocal compensation will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
we are currently negotiating and implementing new interconnection agreements and the terms of the related reciprocal compensation 
the per minute reciprocal compensation rate we receive from pacific bell under our current agreement is significantly lower than it was under our previous agreement 
based on current market conditions  we expect the per minute reciprocal compensation rate will continue to decline from historic rates under interconnection agreements in the future 
operating costs 
operating costs are comprised primarily of leased transport charges  usage charges for long distance and intrastate calls and  to a lesser extent  reciprocal compensation related to calls that originate with a pac west customer and terminate on the network of an incumbent local exchange carrier or other competitive local exchange carrier 
our leased transport charges are the lease payments we incur for the transmission facilities used to connect our customers to our switch and to connect to the incumbent local exchange carrier and other competitive local exchange carriers 
our strategy of leasing rather than building our own transport facilities results in our operating costs being a significant component of total costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our recurring selling  general and administrative expenses include network development  administration and maintenance costs  selling and marketing  customer service  information technology  billing  corporate administration and personnel 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of operations as a percentage of revenues for pac west for the years ended december   and selling  general and administrative expenses and income from operations for the year ended december  include million of one time transaction bonuses and consultant s costs

depreciation and amortization expense income from operations net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the same period ended in  which included settlement payments totaling million received in connection with previously withheld reciprocal compensation 
the increase in revenues is primarily attributed to an increase of million in paid local interconnection revenues  an increase of million in switched access charges  an increase of million and million in recurring charges and installation charges billed directly to internet service providers and business customers  respectively  an increase of million in local and long distance usage revenues  an increase of million in dedicated transport revenues and million in product and service revenues from installnet  which we acquired in february in  we activated a new higher capacity switch in oakland  installed a second switching system at our los angeles facility  while continuing to expand the switching capacity of the existing los angeles facility  and completed construction of a switching facility in las vegas and near seattle  washington

the million increase in outbound local and long distance revenues  including number and travel card calls  represented a increase in over this increase is directly related to internal growth and the acquisition of napa telecom customers  acquired in january the company continues to focus on providing services to high volume  telecommunication intensive users and to small and medium sized businesses 
the million  or  increase in dedicated transport revenues primarily relates to increased data networking services for private corporate networks 
our consolidated operating costs for increased million to million from million in this increase in costs was primarily due to an increase in network operations associated with a higher level of telecommunications activity 
in addition  we continued to make significant investments in our telephone infrastructure to accommodate the future growth of our communications services 
excluding the reciprocal compensation settlement of million in  costs of sales and operating costs represented of revenues for both years 
our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million to million from million in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of additional payroll expenses incurred in connection with the retention of employees acquired from acquisitions and the hiring of additional employees to accommodate growth in our business  including additional employees in our sales and marketing departments  additional network employees  additional service technicians  additional customer service representatives  and additional employees in other administration and information technology functions

the local telecommunications service business is capital intensive 
our operations have required  and will continue to require  substantial capital investment for the design  acquisition  construction and implementation of our network 
capital expenditures  including amounts financed under capital leases  were million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
of the million of capital expenditures during  not including the capital lease facility of  million was included in projects in progress as of december  and therefore is not being depreciated until placed in service in our business plan  as currently contemplated  anticipates capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  of approximately million in the actual cost of our planned expansion will depend on a variety of factors  including the cost of the development of our network in each of our new markets  the extent of competition and pricing of the telecommunications services in such markets  and the acceptance of our services 
accordingly  our actual capital requirements may exceed  or fall below  the amounts described above 
our senior credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of million for working capital and other general corporate purposes  and bears interest  at our option  at the base rate  as defined in our senior credit facility  or the libor rate  as defined in the senior credit facility  plus between and 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under this facility and the borrowing rate would have been approximately 
any borrowings under our senior credit facility will be secured by substantially all of our assets 
the senior credit facility has a three year term expiring june in  the company secured a lease facility of up to million to be used exclusively for the acquisition of networking equipment and related services sold by cisco systems  inc as of december  the company purchased approximately million of equipment under this facility  which is being accounted for as a capital lease 
our principal sources of funds for and are anticipated to be current cash and short term investment balances  cash flows from operating activities  and if necessary  borrowings under the senior credit facility 
we believe that these funds will provide us with sufficient liquidity and capital resources for us to fund our business plan through no assurance can be given  however  that this will be the case 
the foregoing statements do not take into account additional acquisitions which  if made  are expected to be funded through a combination of cash and equity 
depending upon our rate of growth and profitability  and or if we pursue any significant acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing to meet our working capital requirements or capital equipment needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on terms satisfactory to us 
our senior credit facility and the senior notes indenture contain financial and other covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets 
such limitations could limit corporate and operating activities  including our ability to respond to market conditions to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our business over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the sec s rule related to market risk disclosure requires that we describe and quantify our potential losses from market risk sensitive instruments attributable to reasonably possible market changes 
market risk sensitive instruments include all financial or commodity instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to future changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other market factors 
we are not exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments nor do we hold securities for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had million of fixed rate notes outstanding  and consequently we currently have no risk exposure associated with increasing interest rates on our debt 
in addition  we have a line of credit with a variable interest rate tied to libor  however  there were no amounts outstanding at december  we are  however  exposed to changes in interest rates on our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments are in money market funds that hold short term investment grade commercial paper  treasury bills or other us government obligations 
currently this reduces our exposure to long term interest rate changes 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point decline in short term interest rates would reduce the annualized earnings on our million of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  by approximately
