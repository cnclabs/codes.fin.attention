in addition  the increase in these expenses was due to the impact of having a full year of esgc costs in compared to a half year in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets declined million  or million in compared to million in 
the decrease in these expenses was due to the write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets during the third quarter of the goodwill is being amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of seven years 
the other intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from six months to seven years 
impairment loss in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment loss of million  as determined in accordance with sfas  relating to the write down to fair value of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets acquired in the acquisitions of agi and sri 
the impairment loss consisted of the write off of million of goodwill  million of intangible assets and million of property  plant and equipment 
no such loss was incurred in in addition to continued losses at agi  the impairment loss was the result of the following additional circumstances i delays in product introductions for the accelgalaxy tm  e s lightning tm and the multiple controller graphics subsystems product line  ii the developer of the chip used on the accelgmx tm acquired a board company and entered the graphics accelerator market in direct competition with the accelgmx  and iii introduction of lower end products by competitors which can perform many of the functions of the higher end d graphics cards 
furthermore  the company determined that a manufacturer of a chip to be used in various new board products was unable to manufacture a designed chip with agreed upon specifications 
restructuring charge in the third quarter of  the company initiated a restructuring plan focused on reducing the operating cost structure of its realimage solutions group 
as part of the plan  the company recorded a charge of million relating to employee terminations 
no such charge was incurred in acquired in process technology in the second quarter of  the company recognized million of expense to write off acquired in process technology related to the acquisitions of agi and sri 
no such expense was recognized in other income expense  net other income expense  net decreased million  or million in compared to million in 
interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is primarily due to the decrease in the average cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances in as compared to during  the company recognized a gain of million as a result of the sale of its investment in sense corporation 
the company recognized a loss due to the write down of its investment securities of million and million in and  respectively 
the write downs were necessary as management believed that the decline in market value of these investments below cost were other than temporary 
other was million income in and million expense in increase in other income is due to foreign currency transaction gains and other miscellaneous items in compared to foreign currency transaction losses in and other miscellaneous items 
income taxes the effective tax rate was of pre tax loss in and was of pre tax income excluding the write off of acquired in process technology in the change in the effective tax rate is due to the company incurring a pre tax loss in and the benefit of research and other tax credits 
the company expects the effective income tax rate in to approximate the rate in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to working capital of million at december  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
during  the company used million of cash in its operating activities  used million of cash in its investing activities and generated million of cash in its financing activities 
cash from operating activities of the company was provided by a million decrease in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million increase in accounts payable 
the decrease in net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was due to the achievement of billing milestones during the year and the adjustment to revenue on percent complete contracts due to the change in estimated actual costs to complete the contracts 
cash used in the company s operating activities included a net loss adjusted for non cash expenses and income for the year of million  a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory 
the company s investing activities included purchases of property  plant and equipment of million  proceeds from sales of property  plant and equipment of million  proceeds from the sale of certain assets of its digital video business of million and proceeds from sale of investment securities of million 
the company s financing activities during the year included net borrowings of million  proceeds from issuances of common stock of million  increase in restricted cash of million and payments of debt issuance costs of million 
on march   the company entered into a secured credit facility the zions facility with zions first national bank 
the zions facility provided for borrowings of up to million  which included a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
in december  the company entered into a secured credit facility the foothill facility with foothill capital corporation foothill 
in connection with the foothill facility  additional borrowings under the zions facility were terminated in december and outstanding letters of credit were secured through the issuance of a letter of credit from wells fargo bank  national association  the parent of foothill 
the foothill facility provides for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the foothill facility expires in december borrowings under the foothill facility bear interest at the wells fargo bank national association prevailing prime rate plus to  depending on the amount outstanding 
the foothill facility provides foothill with a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of the company s assets  including  but not limited to  all of the company s intellectual property 
pursuant to the terms of the foothill facility  all cash receipts of the company must be deposited into a foothill controlled account 
the foothill facility  among other things  i requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year  ii restricts the company s ability to incur debt or liens  sell  assign  pledge or lease assets  merge with another company  and iii restricts the payment of dividends and repurchase of any of the company s outstanding shares without the prior consent of the lender 
the company is currently in compliance with its financial covenants and ratios  although a continuation of recent negative trends could impact future compliance with such covenants 
should the need arise  the company will negotiate with foothill to modify and expand various financial ratios and covenants  however no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow the company to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to the company 
as of december   the company has million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under the foothill facility 
evans sutherland computer limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of evans sutherland computer corporation  has a million overdraft facility the overdraft facility with lloyds tsb bank plc lloyds 
borrowings under the overdraft facility bear interest at lloyds short term offered rate plus per annum 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the overdraft facility 
the overdraft facility is subject to reduction or demand repayment for any reason at any time at lloyds discretion and expires on november  evans sutherland computer limited executed a letter of negative pledge in favor of lloyds whereby it agreed not to sell or encumber its assets  except in the ordinary course of business 
covenants contained in the overdraft facility restrict dividend payments from evans sutherland computer limited and require maintenance of certain financial covenants 
in addition  at december   the company has million of cash on deposit with lloyds in a restricted cash collateral account to support certain obligations that the bank guarantees 
at december   the company has unsecured letters of credit totaling approximately million outstanding with us bank  us that expire between march and june as of december   the company had approximately million of convertible subordinated debentures due in the debentures 
the debentures are unsecured and are convertible at each bondholder s option into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of or  shares of the company s common stock  subject to adjustment 
the debentures are redeemable at the company s option  in whole or in part  at par 
on february   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock  including the  shares still available from the repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on november  on september   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
subsequent to february  through december  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  leaving  shares available for repurchase as of march  the company did not repurchase any shares of the company s common stock in stock may be acquired in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
under the program  repurchases may be made from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price  and other factors 
the company also maintains trade credit arrangements with certain of its suppliers 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the various borrowing facilities of the company or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operations 
in the event the company s various borrowing facilities were to become unavailable  the company were unable to timely deliver products pursuant to the terms of various agreements with third parties  or certain of the company s contracts were adversely impacted for failure to meet delivery requirements  the company may be unable to meet its anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures  and current debt service obligations on a short term and long term basis 
management believes that existing cash  cash equivalents  borrowings available under its various borrowing facilities  other asset related cash sources and expected cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital needs  routine capital expenditures and current debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
the foothill facility expires in december and the overdraft facility expires on november  there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in renegotiating its existing borrowing facilities or obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
the company s cash and cash equivalents  subject to various restrictions previously set forth  are available for working capital needs  capital expenditures  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  stock repurchases and other potential cash needs as they may arise 
acquired in process technology in connection with the acquisitions of agi and sri  the company made allocations of the purchase price to various acquired in process technology projects 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges in the quarter ended june  because the acquired in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  has had a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment loss of million consisting of a write off of million of goodwill  million of intangible assets and million of property  plant and equipment 
actual sales  operating profits and cash flows attributable to acquired in process technology have been significantly lower than the original projections used to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions 
on going operations and financial results for the acquired technology and the company as a whole are subject to a variety of factors which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such acquisitions  and the estimates discussed below should not be considered the company s current projections for operating results for the acquired businesses or the company as a whole 
following is a description of the acquired in process technology and the estimates made by the company for each of the technologies 
mid range professional graphics subsystem 
this technology is a graphics subsystem with built in vga core and integral dma engines 
this technology provides superior graphics performance over previous technologies  and includes features such as stereo and dual monitor support and various texture memory configurations 
the technology is used in the accelgalaxy product  which was completed and began shipping to customers in late third quarter of the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million  million over the budgeted amount and was funded by working capital 
the project was also completed a month later than scheduled 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
cad focused professional graphics subsystem 
this technology is a graphics subsystem with lower costs compared to the mid range technology  resulting in a more cost effective graphics solution for the end user 
it provides the cost sensitive user with adequate graphics performance  with few features and a single texture configuration option 
the technology is used in the e s lightning product  which was completed in march and began shipping to customers in april the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million  million over the budgeted amount and was funded by working capital 
this project was completed five months later than originally projected 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
multiple controller graphics subsystems 
this technology is a high end graphics subsystem involving the parallel use of two or four controllers 
this technology is aimed at super users in the graphics area who need significant increases in performance and features to accomplish their tasks and are willing to pay the increased price necessary to support those requirements 
during the third quarter of  the company determined the technology and graphics subsystem  as originally designed  would not be a viable product in the workstation marketplace 
the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million 
the project was completed in the fourth quarter of  approximately months later than planned 
this project was funded by working capital 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
on board geometry engine graphics subsystem accelgmx 
this technology is a mid range graphics subsystem with a geometry engine on board 
this technology is aimed at the performance intensive graphics end user 
it has fewer features than the mid range professional technology  but faster geometry performance compared to the mid range professional technology on pentium ii processors 
this technology was completed in the third quarter of and the accelgmx product that uses this technology began shipping to customers at that time 
the cost to complete this project subsequent to the acquisition of agi was million and was funded by working capital 
the assigned value for this acquired in process technology was million 
the accelgalaxy performed below sales estimates due to the delay in product introduction by the company and a delayed design win at one major oem 
these delays  in addition to increased competition  caused an erosion of approximately of the projected average selling price for the accelgalaxy and a loss of projected unit sales 
subsequent to the company s acquisition of agi  the developer of the chip used on the accelgmx also acquired a board company and entered the graphics accelerator market in direct competition with the accelgmx 
due to the advantage of producing the chip  the competitor can produce a comparable product at a lower cost  thus  the accelgmx has performed below sales estimates and the company no longer expects to generate significant sales from this product 
the e s lightning performed below sales estimates due to the delay in product introduction by the company 
as a result of the delay in product introduction  most oems selected a competing product 
the expected sales volume and average selling price of the e s lightning have been significantly reduced 
the company periodically reviews the value assigned to the separate components of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets through comparison to anticipated  undiscounted cash flows from the underlying assets to assess recoverability 
the assets are considered to be impaired when the expected future undiscounted cash flows from these assets do not exceed the carrying balances of the related assets 
based on the events described above and in accordance with sfas during the third quarter of the company recorded an impairment loss of million related to the acquisition of agi and sri 
the impairment loss consisted of the write off of million of goodwill  million of intangible assets and million of property  plant and equipment 
effects of inflation the effects of inflation were not considered material during fiscal years  and  and are not expected to be material for fiscal year outlook looking forward  the company expects sales to increase in the increase in expected sales is due primarily to higher anticipated sales in the simulation and application groups offset by lower anticipated sales in the realimage solutions group 
sales in the simulation group are expected to increase in as compared to as orders and backlog continue to grow in those businesses 
as of december  the company s orders backlog was million 
we believe the company s main challenge is the completion of the company s significant contracts 
the company is in the process of completing certain contracts  which include the harmony image generator 
certain of these contracts were to be completed and integrated during and consequently  as of december   in accordance with original contractual provisions  the company incurred liquidated damages and late delivery penalties totaling million 
the company paid million of this amount in the company is investing considerable resources in capital equipment  human resources and other research and development expenses to develop harmony related products 
the near term success of the company is dependent in large part on the successful execution of these programs 
the company is currently evaluating various business arrangements of its realimage solutions group and its e s rapidsite business in order to enhance the value of these businesses  including  but not limited to  transferring the assets of each of these businesses to wholly owned subsidiaries and seeking outside investment to assist with the development of the products of these businesses 
the foregoing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act of  as amended  including  among others  those statements preceded by  followed by or including the words estimates  believes  expects  anticipates  plans  projects  and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements include projections of sales and net income and issues that may affect sales or net income  projections of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  financing needs or plans  plans relating to the company s products and services  plans to enter into various arrangements to enhance the value of realimage solutions group and the e s rapidsite business and assumptions relating to the foregoing 
forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  some of which cannot be predicted or quantified 
future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in  contemplated by  or underlying the forward looking information 
in addition to the other risks described below in the factors that may affect future results  important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include risk of product demand  market acceptance  economic conditions  competitive products and pricing  difficulties in product development  product delays  commercialization and technology 
in light of these risks and uncertainties  there can be no assurance that the events contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report will  in fact  occur 
factors that may affect future results evans sutherland s domestic and international businesses operate in highly competitive markets that involve a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
while we are optimistic about our long term prospects  the following discussion highlights some risks and uncertainties that should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
e s s business may suffer if our competitive strategy is not successful our continued success depends on our ability to compete in an industry that is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving products in both price and performance 
as most market areas in which we operate continue to grow  we are experiencing increased competition  and we expect this trend to continue 
in recent years  we have been forced to adapt to domestic and worldwide political  economic  and technological developments that have strongly affected our markets 
under our current competitive strategy  we endeavor to remain competitive by growing existing businesses  developing new businesses internally  selectively acquiring businesses  increasing efficiency  improving access to new markets  and reducing costs 
although our executive management team and board of directors continue to review and monitor our strategic plans  we have no assurance that we will be able to continue to follow our current strategy or that this strategy will be successful 
e s s stock price may be adversely impacted if our sales or earnings fail to meet expectations our stock price is subject to significant volatility and will likely be adversely affected if sales or earnings in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations 
our sales and earnings may fail to meet expectations because they fluctuate and are difficult to predict 
our earnings during and fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
one of the reasons we experience such fluctuations is that the largest share of our sales and earnings is from our simulation group  which typically has long delivery cycles and contract lengths 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale commercial or government contracts may affect the timing and amount of sales that can be recognized  thus  causing our periodic operating results to fluctuate 
our results may further fluctuate if united states and international governments delay or even cancel production on large scale contracts due to lack of available funding 
our earnings may not meet either investor or internal expectations because our budgeted operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and even a small sales shortfall may cause a period s results to be below expectations 
such a sales shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including o delays in the availability of products  o delays from chip suppliers  o discontinuance of key components from suppliers  o other supply constraints  o transit interruptions  o overall economic conditions  and o customer demand 
another reason our earnings may not meet expectations is that our gross margins are heavily influenced by mix considerations 
these mix considerations include the mix of lower margin prime contracts versus sub contracts  the mix of new products and markets versus established products and markets  the mix of high end products versus low end products  as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
future margins may not duplicate historical margins or growth rates 
our significant debt could adversely affect our financial resources and prevent us from satisfying our debt service obligations we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or have future borrowings available to us  sufficient to pay our debt 
at december   total indebtedness was million and our total stockholders equity was million 
our ability to make debt payments or refinance our indebtedness depends on future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth  management believes that available cash flow  together with available credit  will be adequate to meet our financial needs 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing of debt would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including  but not limited to  the following i the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or other purposes may be impaired or unavailable  ii a portion of cash flow will be used to pay interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  iii a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or an increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and force us to modify operations  iv we may be more highly leveraged than our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  v our substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or in the economy generally  and vi some of our existing debt contains financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  acquire and dispose of assets  and pay cash dividends 
a portion of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
any increase in interest rates will reduce funds available to us for our operations and future business opportunities and will exacerbate the consequences of our leveraged capital structure 
covenants and restrictions in our credit documents limit our ability to take certain actions our credit documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants include  among others  restrictions on our ability to o declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock  o incur certain additional debt  o grant liens  o make certain payments and investments  o sell or otherwise dispose of assets  and o consolidate with other entities 
we must also meet certain financial ratios and tests  including a minimum tangible net worth that adjusts each quarter and a limitation of million of aggregate capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
failure to comply with the obligations contained in the credit documents could result in an event of default  and possibly the acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing debt that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we are currently in compliance with our financial covenants  although a continuation of recent negative operating trends could impact our future compliance with such covenants 
should the need arise  we will negotiate with our lenders to modify and expand various financial covenants  however  no assurance can be given that such negotiations will result in modifications that will allow us to continue to be in compliance or otherwise be acceptable to us 
delays in the timely delivery of our products may prevent us from invoicing our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
in accordance with accounting for long term contracts  we record an asset for our costs and estimated earnings that exceed the amount we are able to bill our customers on uncompleted contracts 
at december   million of our costs and estimated earnings that exceeded our billings on uncompleted contracts related to five contracts with five different customers 
we are not able to bill these amounts unless we meet certain contractual milestones related to the delivery and integration of our harmony image generators 
our failure to achieve these contractual milestones by timely delivering and integrating our harmony image generators may significantly impact our ability to recover our costs and estimated earnings that exceeded our billings on uncompleted contracts  which could severely impact our cash flow 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our name recognition efforts and ability to compete effectively currently  we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards including trade secret protection 
to protect our intellectual property rights in the future  we intend to continue to rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and common law safeguards  including trade secret protection 
we also rely on restrictions on use  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees  affiliates  customers  alliance partners and others 
the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary information 
a third party could obtain our proprietary information or develop products or technology competitive with ours 
we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services to the same extent as in the united states 
failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm or even destroy our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively 
further  enforcing our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and may not prove successful 
we could incur substantial costs defending our intellectual property from claims of infringement the industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding copyright  patent and other intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that our own intellectual property rights are invalid 
claims of infringement could require us to reengineer or rename our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products 
licensing or royalty agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
even if successfully defended  claims of infringement could also result in significant expense to us and the diversion of our management and technical resources 
e s s significant investment in research and development may not be realized we have no assurance that our significant investment in research and development will generate future sales or benefits 
we currently make and plan to continue to make a significant investment in research and development 
total spending for research and development was million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in this investment is necessary for us to be able to compete in the graphics simulation industry 
developing new products and software is expensive and often involves a long payback cycle 
while we have every reason to believe these investments will be rewarded with sales generating products  customer acceptance ultimately dictates the success of development and marketing efforts 
e s may not continue to be successful if we are unable to develop  produce and transition our products our continued success depends on our ability to develop  produce and transition technologically complex and innovative products that meet customer needs 
we have no assurance that we will be able to successfully continue such development  production and transition 
the development of new technologies and products is increasingly complex and expensive  which among other risks  increases the risk of product introduction delays 
the introduction of a new product requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design and manufacturing teams within e s as well as teams at outside suppliers of key components 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our new products to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish and the market demands 
as the variety and complexity of our product families increase  the process of planning and managing production  inventory levels  and delivery schedules also becomes increasingly complex 
there is no assurance that acceptance of and demand for our new products will not be affected by delays in this process 
additionally  if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to the penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts  and termination of our contracts 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
our short product life cycles require our ability to successfully manage the timely transition from current products to new products 
in fact  it is not unusual for us to announce a new product while its predecessor is still in the final stages of its development 
our transition results could be adversely affected by such factors as o development delays  o late release of products to manufacturing  o quality or yield problems experienced by production or suppliers  o variations in product costs  o excess inventories of older products and components  and o delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of the introduction of new products 
in the event e s suffers further product delays  e s may be required to pay certain customers substantial liquidated damages the variety and complexity of our high technology product lines require us to deal with suppliers and subcontractors supplying highly specialized parts  operating highly sophisticated and narrow tolerance equipment in performing highly technical calculations 
the processes of planning and managing production  inventory levels and delivery schedules are also highly complex and specialized 
many of our products must be custom designed and manufactured  which is not only complicated and expensive  but can also require a number of months to accomplish 
slight errors in design  planning and managing production  inventory levels  delivery schedules  or manufacturing can result in unsatisfactory products that may not be correctable 
if we are unable to meet our delivery schedules  we may be subject to penalties  including liquidated damages that are included in some of our customer contracts 
during the fourth quarter of  we accrued million for payments of liquidated damages and penalties due to product delays 
as of december   we have paid million in connection with liquidated damages 
during  we accrued an additional million for late delivery penalties that is expected to be settled in there is no assurance that we may not incur substantial liquidated damages in the future in connection with further product delays 
e s may not maintain a significant portion of our sales if we fail to maintain our united states government contracts in  of our sales were to agencies of the united states government  either directly or through prime contractors or subcontractors  for which there is intense competition 
accordingly  we have no assurance that we will be able to maintain a significant portion of our sales 
these sales are subject to the inherent risks related to government contracts  including uncertainty of economic conditions  changes in government policies and requirements that may reflect rapidly changing military and political developments  and unavailability of funds 
these risks also include technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and dependence on annual congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in the past  some of our programs have been delayed  curtailed  or terminated 
although we cannot predict such uncertainties  in our opinion there are no spending reductions or funding limitations pending that would impact our contracts 
other characteristics of the government contract market that may affect our operating results include the complexity of designs  the difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work  and the speed with which product lines become obsolete due to technological advances and other factors characteristic of the market 
our earnings may vary materially on some contracts depending upon the types of government long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  and the achievement of other performance objectives 
furthermore  due to the intense competition for available united states government business  maintaining or expanding government business increasingly requires us to commit additional working capital for long term programs and additional investments in company funded research and development 
our dependence on government contracts may lead to other perils as well because as a united states government contractor or sub contractor  our contracts and operations are subject to government oversight 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of our contract performance and cost accounting 
these investigations may lead to claims against e s 
under united states government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts  a conviction could result in debarment for a specified period of time 
e s s sales may suffer if we lose certain significant customers we currently derive a significant portion of our sales from a limited number of non us government customers 
the loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were dependent on four of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales and three of our non us government customers for approximately of our consolidated sales in and  respectively 
we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales in the foreseeable future 
we have no assurance that sales from this limited number of customers will continue to reach or exceed historical levels in the future 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our significant customers 
e s s sales will decrease if we fail to maintain our international business any reduction of our international business could significantly affect our sales 
our international business accounted for of our sales 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our overall business in the foreseeable future 
our international business experiences many of the same risks our domestic business encounters as well as additional risks such as exposure to currency fluctuations and changes in foreign economic and political environments 
despite our exposure to currency fluctuations  we are not engaged in any material hedging activities to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the ongoing economic crisis affecting the asian markets is an example of a change in a foreign economic environment that could affect our international business 
any similar economic downturns may also decrease the number of orders we receive and our receivable collections 
our international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from stringent contractual terms and conditions and widely differing legal systems  customs  and standards in foreign countries 
in addition  our international sales often include sales to various foreign government armed forces  with many of the same inherent risks associated with united states government sales identified previously 
future losses could impair our ability to raise capital or borrow money and consequently affect our stock price although we recorded net sales of million for the twelve months ended december   we incurred a net loss of million in we have incurred net losses totaling million over the past three years 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in future periods 
losses in future periods could impair our ability to raise additional capital or borrow money as needed  could decrease our stock price and could cause a violation of certain covenants in our credit facility 
if e s s commercial simulation business fails  e s s sales will decrease we have no assurance that our commercial simulation airline business will continue to succeed 
our commercial simulation business currently accounts for approximately to of our sales 
this business is subject to many of the risks related to the commercial simulation market that may adversely affect our business 
the following risks are characteristic of the commercial simulation market o uncertainty of economic conditions  o dependence upon the strength of the commercial airline industry  o air pilot training requirements  o competition  o changes in technology  and o timely performance by subcontractors on contracts in which e s is the prime contractor 
we may make acquisitions that are unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources from more profitable operations we intend to consider acquisitions  alliances  and transactions involving other companies that could complement our existing business 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counterparties 
also  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to complete any such transaction or consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate acquisitions  our operating expenses may increase 
this increase would affect our net earnings  which could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities 
moreover  these types of transactions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
these transactions involve numerous other risks as well  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
our contemplated business arrangements to enhance the value of our realimage solutions group and rapidsite business may not be successful 
we are considering various business arrangements relating to our realimage solutions group and our rapidsite business in order to enhance the value of these businesses  including  but not limited to  transferring the assets of each of these two businesses to wholly owned subsidiaries and seeking outside investment to assist with the development of the products of these businesses 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable parties  joint venture candidates  or transaction counterparties 
also  even if we can identify suitable parties  we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to complete any such transaction or consummate these transactions on terms that we find favorable 
these transactions involve numerous other risks as well  including the diversion of management attention from other business concerns and entry into markets in which we have had only limited experience 
occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on us 
e s s shareholders may not realize certain opportunities because of the anti takeover effect of state law we may be subject to the utah control shares acquisition act which provides that any person who acquires or more of the outstanding voting shares of a publicly held utah corporation will not have voting rights with respect to the acquired shares unless a majority of the disinterested shareholders of the corporation votes to grant such rights 
this could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or other advantages that large accumulations of stock would provide because anyone interested in acquiring e s could only do so with the cooperation of our board of directors
