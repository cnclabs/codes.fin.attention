this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the company s future operating results and financial position 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding sales  acquisitions  gross margin  workers compensation costs  communication costs  selling and administrative expenses  depreciation expenses  interest expense  income taxes  capital expenditures  capital resources  management information systems and medical operations 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the forward looking statements included herein are also subject to a number of other risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to demand for the company s services  the competition within its markets  the loss of a principal customer and the company s ability to increase the productivity of its existing offices  to control costs  to expand operations  the availability of sufficient personnel  including the employment and retention of a qualified chief executive officer  and the ability of the company to complete the realization of the remaining medical assets 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future period the company s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in addition  the company s results of operations have historically been subject to quarterly and seasonal fluctuations 
demand for temporary staffing is historically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter  due largely to the planning cycles of many of the company s customers  and typically lower in the first fiscal quarter  due  in part  to national holidays as well as to plant shutdowns during and after the holiday season 
these and other risks and uncertainties related to the company s business are described in detail in factors affecting future operating results 
overview the company provides temporary staffing services primarily in suburban and rural markets secondary markets  as well as in the downtown areas of major urban centers primary markets  in the united states and selected international markets 
through its network of company owned  franchise agent and licensed offices  the company offers a wide range of temporary staffing solutions  including replacement  supplemental and on site programs to businesses and government agencies 
the company has over years of experience in the staffing industry and operates over business services offices in states  the district of columbia and five foreign countries 
the company differentiates itself from other large temporary staffing companies by primarily focusing on recruiting and placing essential support personnel in secondary markets 
essential support personnel often fill clerical  light industrial and light technical positions such as word processing  data entry  reception  customer service and telemarketing  warehouse labor  manufacturing  assembly and lab assistance 
these assignments can support either core or non core functions of the customer s business  but are always essential to daily operations 
the general level of economic activity and unemployment in the united states and the countries in which the company operates significantly affects demand for the company s staffing services 
companies use temporary staffing services to manage personnel costs and staffing needs 
when economic activity increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
during these periods of increased economic activity and generally higher levels of employment  the competition among temporary staffing firms for qualified temporary personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that during these periods the company will be able to recruit the temporary personnel necessary to fill its customers job orders in which case the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition may be adversely affected 
as economic activity slows  many companies reduce their utilization of temporary employees before releasing full time employees 
in addition  the company may experience less demand for its services and more competitive pricing pressure during periods of economic downturn 
therefore  any significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
recent developments on may   the company announced that a recapitalization agreement signed on march  was terminated by mutual consent of all parties 
in connection with the termination  michael k 
phippen  then president and chief executive officer  resigned and w 
robert stover  chairman of the board of directors  assumed the position of interim president and chief executive officer 
as a result of the recapitalization termination  the company incurred  in pre tax charges during the second quarter of fiscal and recorded additional pre tax charges of million in the third fiscal quarter ended july  discontinued operations in november  the company announced its plan to sell western medical 
as a result of this decision  the company has classified its medical operations as discontinued operations and  accordingly  has segregated the net assets of the discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in connection with the decision to discontinue the medical operations  the company recorded an after tax loss in fiscal of million or per share 
this loss was related primarily to reduced revenues in connection with medicare s interim payment system enacted as part of the balanced budget act of  reduced revenues as a result of settlement of a prior year medicare audit  additional reserves for medicare accounts receivable  increases in allowances for doubtful accounts and other charges 
in addition  during fiscal the company recorded an after tax charge on the planned disposal of its medical operations of million or per share 
this included an estimated charge for the write down of assets to estimated net realizable value  estimated costs to sell the operations and estimated operating losses during the disposal period 
during fiscal  the company sold certain of its franchise agent and company owned medical offices and entered into a termination agreement with one of its medical licensees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the sale of the remaining medical business 
under the terms of the sale  the company retained the trade and medicare accounts receivable balances as well as the due from licensee balances 
in fiscal  the company recorded after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of million or per share 
these losses primarily represented reserves for trade and medicare accounts receivable and due from licensee balances  and also included additional operating losses resulting from the extended period required to close the sale and a reduction in the estimated proceeds from the sale 
during fiscal  the company recorded additional after tax losses relating to discontinued operations of  or per share 
this charge was primarily due to lower than expected settlements of medicare cost reports 
the company has appealed a number of cost report settlements and hopes to recover additional funds in the future  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its appeals 
as of october   the company has received million in cash proceeds from the sale of its medical operations with an additional million due on the balance of the purchase price 
the million balance due  plus interest thereon  is owed to the company under a guaranteed promissory note  which is in default 
see item legal proceedings 
the amount of the estimated loss on disposal of the medical operations is based on a number of assumptions 
these include the estimated costs and write offs required to collect the remaining medicare accounts receivable and due from licensee balances and estimated costs to be incurred in filing and settling all remaining medicare cost reports 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the collection of the remaining medicare accounts receivable and due from licensee balances on terms and costs similar to those estimated by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in collecting the remaining million outstanding purchase price balance due on the sale of the medical business 
should actual costs differ materially from those estimated by management  the company would record additional losses or gains in future periods 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of sales of services and license fees 
fiscal year sales of services license fees total sales of services and license fees costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income from continuing operations interest expense interest income income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
sales of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal average bill rates increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  while billed hours declined slightly 
same store sales increased by for fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of services increased for domestic business services and for international business services 
fiscal domestic sales of services have been adversely affected by competitive pressures for the supply of temporary staff as a result of the low unemployment rates in the united states economy during fiscal as well as more recent decreasing demand for temporary staffing services in some sectors of the economy 
recent trends in the united states economy are indicating a possible slowdown in economic activity 
depending upon the extent of the economic slowdown  the company currently estimates that its sales will decline during at least the first quarter of fiscal  and quite likely beyond 
continued declines in foreign currency exchange rates have negatively impacted the international results as reported 
excluding the effect of these rate fluctuations  fiscal international sales of services increased as compared to fiscal acquisitions did not have a significant effect on the increase in fiscal sales of services 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees 
fiscal acquisitions were limited to buy backs and conversion of six of the company s franchise agents operations to company owned offices 
license fees are charged to licensed offices based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the licensed offices 
license fees decreased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company purchased the operations of one of its licensees  two licensees converted to the company s franchise agent program  and two licensees essentially closed operations 
the company is currently in negotiations with two of its licensees who wish to purchase the company s interest in their licensed operations 
license fees for these two licensees in fiscal were approximately million 
if these negotiations are successful  the company would recognize a gain on the sale at the date of the closing  however  future license fee income from these operations would cease 
cost of services 
costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to higher workers compensation costs and lower license fees 
additionally  the company has expanded its on location program accounts which generally carry lower margins than traditional service accounts  and is experiencing increased downward pressures on margins due to competition 
the company will continue its efforts to improve gross margin where feasible  however  within the current business climate and with increased workers compensation costs  the company believes that there are fewer opportunities available to increase gross margin 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in either increasing or maintaining gross margin 
workers compensation costs were of payroll for fiscal and for fiscal as a result of increases in the company s actuarially estimated ultimate losses for all open policy years  the company recorded an additional charge for workers compensation costs of million  or per share  net of taxes  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company currently estimates that the accrual rates for workers compensation costs will be in the range of to of direct labor for fiscal these rates may change depending upon the results of actuarial estimates 
the company will review interim actuarial estimates throughout fiscal to ensure that accrual rates remain appropriate in light of the company s loss trends 
there can be no assurance that the company s programs to control workers compensation expenses will be effective or that loss development trends will not require a charge to costs of services in future periods to increase workers compensation accruals 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of sales or of gross profit generated by the franchise agents operation 
franchise agents share of gross profit increased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit increased from during fiscal to for fiscal selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal as noted in recent developments above  fiscal includes million in pre tax charges as a result of the terminated recapitalization 
fiscal also reflects increased costs for bad debts  increased communication costs in connection with the company s wide area network  higher depreciation and outside services costs for on going management information system initiatives see item business management information systems and increased foreign currency transaction losses due to the effect of declining exchange rates with the company s international operations 
additionally  selling and administrative expenses for fiscal were lower as a result of domestic gross receipt tax refunds and united kingdom advance corporation tax refunds 
the company has moved aggressively to tighten the controls over credit granting and collections  however  there can be no assurance that such actions will result in a reduction in bad debt levels in the future 
as noted above  selling and administrative expenses are impacted by the company s management information systems 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company replaced its back office financial reporting systems  implemented a new billing and activities management system and implemented a wide area network to allow for enhanced communication and data transmission capabilities among the field and corporate offices 
the company has also been rolling out a new branch office search and retrieval and remote data capture module 
as of october   domestic offices were live on the front office system 
the company expects to complete the initial roll out of the front office system by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the company is currently working on system upgrades and functional enhancements for its financial and billing systems and is developing plans to convert its current temporary payroll system to a new system in fiscal the company is also working with its key software vendor to build additional functionality within the core product that will better serve the needs of the temporary staffing industry 
as a result of these system initiatives  the company incurred increased costs for communications  depreciation and system maintenance during fiscal and fiscal as the wide area network is fully deployed  the company expects communications costs for fiscal to be similar to fiscal furthermore  the company s temporary payroll system is now fully depreciated 
accordingly  depreciation expense for fiscal is expected to decrease as compared to fiscal the company continues to invest in efforts to upgrade and improve the functionality  performance and utility of its systems 
furthermore  the company s temporary payroll system is critical to the success of the company and the planned conversion to the new system will be key to enhancing the performance and functionality of the payroll process 
there can be no assurance that the company will meet anticipated completion dates for its system initiatives  that such systems will be completed in a cost effective manner or that such systems will support the company s future growth or provide significant gains in efficiency and productivity 
the failure of these systems to meet these expected goals could result in increased system costs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of higher average borrowings for domestic business services 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal reflecting the decrease in pre tax income from continuing operations of million 
the effective income tax rate was for both fiscal years 
the company currently estimates that the effective income tax rate for fiscal will be approximately 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales of services and license fees 
sales of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase resulted from a increase in billed hours and a increase in average billing rates per hour 
billed hours increased primarily due to acquisitions  increased demand for the company s services in existing offices and new office openings 
same store sales increased approximately for fiscal as compared to fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increase in sales of services 
sales of services for fiscal increased and  respectively  for domestic business services and international business services as compared to fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations  sales of services increased for international business services 
the increase in average billing rates reflects changes in the company s overall business mix and inflationary factors 
license fees increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to internal growth and to conversions of franchise agents to the license program 
during fiscal  nine franchise agents converted to the license program and two licensees purchased the company s interest in their licenses and became independent 
cost of services 
costs of services increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin was in both fiscal and fiscal gross margin for domestic business services increased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margin for international business services decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily due to lower margins in australia in connection with a large contract with fees based on productive output  which had not yet achieved its targeted productivity levels 
workers compensation costs were of payroll for fiscal and for fiscal these costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical staffing and light industrial staffing 
franchise agents share of gross profit 
franchise agents share of gross profit increased  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  franchise agents share of gross profit declined from during fiscal to for fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of franchise conversions to the license program in fiscal as noted above 
selling and administrative expenses including depreciation and amortization 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  selling and administrative expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of services and license fees was primarily due to higher costs incurred in connection with the company s management information system initiatives see fiscal compared to fiscal selling and administrative expenses and item business management information systems  increased bad debts  higher medical plan costs and higher amortization costs resulting from acquisitions 
the increased costs associated with the company s information system initiatives include higher communication costs in connection with the implementation of the company s wide area network  increased depreciation costs and higher maintenance costs associated with the new software products 
the relative volume of franchise business also affects the overall selling and administrative costs 
as the proportion of franchise sales and gross profit declines relative to total sales due to conversions from franchise agent offices to licensed offices or company owned offices  franchise agents share of gross profit declines as a percentage of sales of services and license fees  and selling and administrative costs tend to increase as a percentage of sales of services and license fees

the company s principal use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of growth and  in relatively recent years  for management information systems initiatives 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
as a result of seasonal fluctuations  accounts receivable balances are historically higher in the fourth fiscal quarter and are generally at their lowest during the first fiscal quarter 
accordingly  short term borrowings used to finance accounts receivable generally follow a similar seasonal pattern 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  increased net cash flows were primarily provided by net deferred tax benefits realized on the discontinued medical operations  increases in the provision for bad debts  changes in due from licensees due to changes in the number of licensees and collection of receivables  and changes in other asset balances 
fiscal cash flows provided by operating activities included million provided by discontinued operations  primarily due to the collection of receivables 
in fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities were reduced by million as a result of medical business operating losses and the estimated loss on the disposal of these operations 
cash used for capital expenditures  which are primarily for management information systems initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively

during fiscal  the company reduced borrowings by a net million

direct advances under the revolving credit agreement are limited by outstanding irrevocable standby letters of credit of up to a maximum amount of million 
total advances are also limited under formulas based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and total debt to total capitalization

the company s debt facilities contain certain financial and other covenants  the most restrictive of which is a total debt to capitalization ratio 
the company was in compliance with these covenants as of october  based on current projections  the management believes there is a possibility that the company may be out of compliance with one of its credit facility s financial covenants in the first quarter of fiscal the company has been out of compliance with one or more covenants in the past and has received waivers and amendments with respect to such covenants from its bank lenders 
the management believes that in the event the company is out of compliance with the covenant  it will be able to obtain a waiver or amendment  however  there can be no assurance that the company s bank lenders would grant one

the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies have been fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies being removed from circulation between january and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage
