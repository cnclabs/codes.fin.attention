item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview aether systems  inc was originally formed as aeros  llc in january we changed our name to aether technologies international  llc effective august and to aether systems llc effective september immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering of common stock on october   the limited liability company was converted into a delaware corporation and our name was changed to aether systems  inc development of our business 
from our inception until march  we primarily provided wireless engineering services  including the development of wireless software applications for customers 
in march  we began offering services that provide the users of wireless handheld devices access to real time financial information 
during  we made a strategic decision to focus a significant portion of our engineering resources on the development of these and other wireless data services and systems  including our aether intelligent messaging aim package of wireless messaging software and software development tools 
in and  we continued to develop financial information services as well as financial transaction services internally and through our acquisition of mobeo  inc in  we also completed our initial public offering and began to expand our service offerings to areas other than financial information and transactions 
in  we continued our expansion into other vertical markets  including the transportation and logistics vertical market through our acquisitions of locusone and motient s retail transportation business unit  the mobile government vertical market through the acquisitions of cerulean and sunpro  and the healthcare vertical market through investments and our own service offerings 
we broadened our software offerings through our purchase of riverbed and rts wireless 
also in  we moved into the european marketplace with our acquisition of ifx  and the related formation of sila 
we entered the general wireless and internet messaging services market through strategic relationships with rim and others and through our own service offerings 
we began to report our financial results by segment as of the first quarter of our current segments are vertical markets  software products  wireless services and european operations 
during  our reportable segments have changed and we expect them to continue to change as our operating structure  business and the market in which we operate evolve 
each of our segments has distinct management teams 
in and  all of our revenue was generated from what is now reported as our vertical market segment 
factors affecting comparability our results of operations in and  have been affected by acquisitions  investments and the formation of sila 
in addition  a combination of factors have resulted in operating losses that we expect will continue for some time 
the factors identified below have had a significant impact on our operations and should be considered in comparing our results of operations in to those in and in comparing our results of operations in to those in acquisitions we have acquired companies to expand our product offerings and geographic markets and to acquire additional engineering resources to develop products 
from september through december   we have acquired businesses or parts of businesses for an aggregate consideration not including contingent payments that had not yet been earned of million and equity of billion  consisting of  shares of our common stock and  replacement options 
these acquisitions included the following during  we acquired mobeo for a purchase price and related expenses of million in cash and  options valued at in early  we acquired locusone  netsearch  and ifx for purchase prices aggregating approximately million 
on march   we acquired riverbed for  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of billion 
in connection with our acquisition of riverbed  we incurred costs totaling approximately million 
in september  we acquired cerulean  sunpro and sinope for purchase prices and related expenses aggregating approximately million and  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of million 
on november   we acquired motient s retail transportation business unit for million in cash and related expenses plus an additional sum of up to million depending on whether certain revenue and other incentive targets are met in on december   we acquired rts for a purchase price of million in cash and related expenses plus  shares of our common stock and  options with an aggregate value of million 
our acquisitions increase our operating revenues and expenses from the date of acquisition 
in the discussion of results below  we quantify the effects of acquisitions on our revenues and expenses 
acquisitions also increase depreciation and amortization significantly as we amortize the value of acquisition intangibles 
amortization related to acquisition intangibles was  in and million in finally  acquisitions affect non cash compensation when we issue options to employees at the time of an acquisition 
the related costs were  in and million in we discuss below under investments charges we may need to take in the future to write down the carrying values of our acquisitions 
investments we have made investments through aether capital  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to promote the development of new technologies that are compatible with the services we offer or that we may wish to integrate into our services 
since august  we have invested million in companies 
these investments include in august  we formed a new company called opensky  which was renamed omnisky in october we have invested a total of million in omnisky 
we formed omnisky with com to pursue opportunities in the emerging consumer and business mass markets for wireless e mail  internet access and other electronic transactions applications 
as of december   we owned approximately of omnisky after completion of omnisky s initial public offering 
we account for our investment in omnisky under the equity method of accounting 
in march  we acquired a interest in inciscent in the form of preferred stock for a purchase price of million 
we formed inciscent with metrocall  psinet  and hicks  muse  tate furst and other investors to develop wireless e mail  internet access and other applications for the small office and home office markets 
we account for our investment in inciscent under the equity method of accounting 
in july  we entered into a non binding agreement with sylvan to establish mindsurf  a new company focused on educational services 
we have committed to acquire a interest in mindsurf for million in cash 
sylvan has also committed to acquire a interest for million in cash while the remaining will be owned by other minority investors 
as of december   we have funded million of our commitment to mindsurf 
we account for our investment in mindsurf under the equity method of accounting 
in july  we acquired a interest in veristar for million in cash 
veristar enables access to accounts and content through internet and wireless technology 
we account for investment in veristar under the equity method of accounting 
we also have invested million in five publicly traded companies including million in metrocall  million in datacritical corporation  and million in novatel 
we account for these five investments at fair value based on quoted market prices 
as of december   the carrying value of these investments was million 
net unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from income and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
subsequent to year end  the market values of these investments have decreased significantly 
finally  we have also invested million in eleven private companies including million in strategy 
com  million in ephones  million in parkstone medical information systems  inc  and million in juniper financial corp 
in january  we invested an additional million in strategy 
com 
we account for these investments at cost unless circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
at the time of our acquisitions and investments  market valuations and the availability of capital for such companies were at historically high levels 
since the end of  stock prices and market valuations in our industry and similar industries have fallen substantially in response to a variety of factors  including a general downturn in the economy  a curtailment in the availability of capital and a general reduction in technology expenditures 
the market valuations of those publicly traded companies in which we have invested  and of other companies similar to those we have acquired or invested in  have declined substantially since december  we are currently evaluating the recent decline in the valuation of our acquisitions and investments to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
we believe that if market valuations of similar companies remain at their current levels or decline further  it is likely that we will determine the market decline to be other than temporary and record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangibles related to our acquisitions and our investments to fair value 
although we cannot determine the amount of any charge we may decide is necessary until we complete our evaluation  any such charge is likely to be substantial 
formation of sila on may   we formed sila with reuters to extend our operations to the european market 
we contributed our ifx subsidiary which we purchased for million shortly before forming sila  plus million in cash to acquire a interest in sila 
reuters contributed cash of approximately million and futures pager limited  a european paging company  for the remaining interest 
the results of sila are consolidated in our financial statements 
factors producing operating losses since our inception  we have invested significant capital to build our customer service and network operations center 
additionally  we have incurred significant operating costs to develop our software platforms and other software applications  and to grow our business 
as a result  we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
part of our strategy is to continue to invest in business development  research and development  and marketing and advertising 
in addition  our past acquisitions will continue to result in option and warrant expense and significant amortization of intangible assets  as will any acquisitions we make in the future 
accordingly  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
operating revenues and expenses we describe below the components of our operating revenues and expenses 
subscriber revenue and expenses we derive recurring revenue from subscribers in the vertical markets  wireless services  software products and european operations segments 
subscriber revenue may consist of a one time non refundable activation fee  which we recognize ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship  monthly per subscriber service fees  which we recognize as services are provided  monthly per subscriber exchange fees for access to financial information from the securities exchanges and markets  which we recognize as services are provided  and monthly fees for providing access to our network operations center  which we recognize as services are provided 
we also generate revenue by providing our subscribers the option to purchase wireless handheld devices from us at or near cost  which we bill either up front or over the initial term of the contract 
for certain of our products  our subscribers monthly fee includes the use of a wireless handheld device 
contracts with our wireless data subscribers are generally for a one year period and include a termination penalty if cancelled by the subscriber before the one year period expires 
these contracts are generally renewable at the option of the subscriber for additional one year periods or otherwise continue on a monthly basis until cancelled by the subscriber 
cost of subscriber revenue consists primarily of airtime costs  financial data costs  wireless handheld device costs and securities exchange and market fees 
our airtime costs are determined by agreements we have with several wireless carriers 
typically  we have one year contracts to buy data network capacity either for an agreed amount of kilobytes at a flat fee or on a cents per kilobyte basis 
the subscription products we offer fall into three distinct categories enterprise asp isp services 
these services wirelessly connect critical functions of a business to end users within the business or to third parties such as customers 
through our enterprise asp isp services  we provide a full wireless solution to the end user  including product development  fulfillment  network hosting  customer service and carrier connections between the business and wireless carriers 
for this type of product  we typically receive revenue from the sale of hardware and a monthly recurring fee for the full range of services between and per month per subscriber 
premium information and commerce services 
these services provide the end user with information critical to their business  such as market information or sales inquiries 
premium information products are packaged with fulfillment  customer service and carrier connections between the business and wireless carriers 
for this type of product  we typically receive revenues such as activation fees and a monthly recurring fee for the full range of services between and per month per subscriber 
network hosting services 
these services connect businesses and wireless carriers 
hosting services may be charged per subscriber or on a usage basis 
average revenue per subscriber typically ranges between and per month 
the nature of revenue and costs for these product categories is similar  regardless of the segment in which we offer them 
accordingly  we believe it is valuable to analyze our subscribers on the basis of these product categories 
the following table sets forth the number of subscribers for each of our product types as of december    and as of december  enterprise asp isp services  premium information commerce services   network hosting services total subscribers   a substantial portion of the growth in subscribers over this period is attributable to service offerings obtained through recent acquisitions and the remainder is due to the attraction of new subscribers to our services and the introduction of new services

research and development expenses  including in process research and development related to acquisitions  increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase in from was primarily due to the hiring of additional engineers and consultants for increased research and development activities associated with the development of our software products  mobile computing platforms and wireless data services 
in addition  we incurred charges of million for in process research and development in connection with our acquisitions of riverbed  cerulean  rts wireless  and ifx in the increase in from was primarily due to the hiring of additional engineers for increased research and development activities associated with the development of our software products and wireless data services 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as we expand our product offerings 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to additional personnel and consultants performing general corporate activities  additional facilities and our acquisitions since the prior year 
the increased scope of our business has required additional personnel and other expenses  such as consulting and facilities  in all areas including customer service  network operations  project management  legal and accounting

we anticipate continued increases in our general and administrative expenses as we expand our operations 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from  for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotion costs  which increased from  to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  including a nationwide broadcast and print branding campaign  as well as increases in the number of sales and marketing personnel primarily obtained through acquisitions 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from  for the year ended december  this increase in was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles and goodwill relating to the acquisition of riverbed  which accounted for million of the expense in  while million related to our other acquisitions 
the increase in was primarily due to amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the mobeo acquisition 
we expect this expense to increase in as a result of a full year of amortization on several of our acquisitions made late in option and warrant expense 
option and warrant expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  and increased from  for the year ended december  the decrease between and was due to our general policy subsequent to our initial public offering of granting shares to employees at their fair value  partially offset by options granted in connection with acquisitions at exercise prices less than fair value on the date of grant 
the increase between and was due to expenses associated with options granted to the selling stockholders of mobeo for consulting and employee services 
the increase was also due to an increase in the number of options that vested during the period in connection with our initial public offering with exercise prices less than the fair value on the date of grant resulting in an expense of million in in january  we canceled million options granted to its employees and issued approximately  shares of restricted stock to a number of employees holding options with exercise prices higher than our then current market value 
we expect to record million of expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock grants 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from an expense of  for the year ended december  interest income was  for the year ended december  the increase between and was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents following the completion of our secondary offering on march  the decrease between and primarily relates to interest and related expense of a loan that funded the purchase price of mobeo  partially offset by interest earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering

vertical markets segment 
in and  all of our revenue was from operations that are now included in our vertical markets segment 
as we operate in a wide variety of vertical markets  our vertical markets segment can have subscriber revenue  engineering services revenue and software and related services revenue depending on the needs of the customer 
revenue in the vertical markets segment increased from million in to million in and gross profit in that segment increased from million in to million in the increase in this segment was primarily the result of sales of product and service offerings obtained in connection with acquisitions and their subsequent growth which contributed million and million to revenue and gross profits  respectively

our wireless services segment can derive revenue from subscribers and from engineering services related to setting up and servicing these subscribers 
all of the increase in revenue and gross profit in the wireless services segment was a result of new product and service offerings  including our blackberry by aether and wireless enterprise isp services 
european operations segment 
our european operations segment consists of sila and generates revenue from subscribers  engineering services and from the sale of software and related services 
sila was formed in may liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of our equity securities 
through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately billion including the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments including restricted cash of million and working capital of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in each of these periods was to fund our losses from operations

while not a measure under generally accepted accounting principles  ebitda is a standard measure of financial performance in our industry 
ebitda means earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and option and warrant expense 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income loss  income loss from operations  cash flows from operating activities  or any other measure of performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
cash expenditures for various long term assets  interest expense and income taxes have been  and will be  incurred which are not reflected in the ebitda presentations 
ebitda losses in increased from million in the first quarter  to million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
the increases from quarter to quarter were due to increases in operating expenses as a result of acquisitions and our continued growth 
we expect to continue to use cash to fund operations as we continue to develop our products and markets 
the time at which our operating revenues will exceed operating expenses  if ever  depends on a wide variety of factors including general business trends  development of our markets  the progress of and changes in our research and development activities and the effect of potential future acquisitions 
given our current cash resources and our ability to control some of the factors that will affect when operating revenues may exceed operating expenses  we believe we have substantial flexibility to continue operations and still have funds available for our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
for fiscal year  we expect to have the following expenditures we are committed to purchase  rim handheld devices 
depending on the mix of products ordered  we estimate the cost will be between and million 
through  we will spend million for debt service on our convertible subordinated notes 
we may be required to pay million for purchase earn outs related to certain acquisition related activities 
in accordance with our agreement with mindsurf  we have committed to invest an additional million in mindsurf in in january  we invested an additional million in strategy 
com 
we are committed to provide additional funding of up to million to sila in in addition to the specific expenditures identified above  we expect to continue to invest cash on other capital expenditures  including acquisitions and other strategic opportunities  additional leasehold improvements  network operations centers and associated furniture and equipment 
factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including those described below 
we have historically incurred losses and these losses may increase in the future 
we reported net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our amortization of intangible assets has grown significantly as a result of recent acquisitions 
in addition  we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  systems development and administrative expenses 
therefore  we will need to generate significant revenue to become profitable and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we may not be able to recover the full value of goodwill recorded on some of our acquisitions and investments 
during and  we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions and made investments in other companies of approximately million 
consideration for some of our acquisitions was partially or fully funded through the issuance of shares of our common stock at a time when our stock price was at historically high prices 
most of the companies we acquired or invested in were start up or newly formed entities 
most of these companies were privately held and their fair values are highly subjective and not readily determinable 
at december   the market value of the public companies in which we have invested exceeded our cost of acquiring those investments 
our policy is to review the value of all our acquisitions and investments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at the time of our acquisitions and investments  market valuations and the availability of capital for such companies were at historically high levels 
since the end of  stock prices and market valuations in our industry and similar industries have fallen substantially in response to a variety of factors  including a general downturn in the economy  a curtailment in the availability of capital and a general reduction in technology expenditures 
the market valuations of those publicly traded companies in which we have invested and of other companies similar to those we have acquired or invested in have declined substantially since december  we are currently evaluating the recent decline in the valuation of our acquisitions and investments to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
we believe that if market valuations of similar companies remain at their current levels or decline further  it is likely that we will determine the market decline to be other than temporary and record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangibles related to our acquisitions and our investments to fair value 
although we cannot determine the amount of any charge we may decide is necessary until we complete our evaluation  any such charge is likely to be substantial 
our future results are uncertain because our historical revenue was derived from services other than those we expect to be the focus of our business in the future 
we only have a limited history selling our current services  by which you can evaluate our business  financial condition and operating results 
although we commenced operations in january  until march  all of our revenue came from engineering services and not from monthly service subscriptions or software licensing which we now provide and which will be our focus in the future 
in addition  our monthly service subscriptions have come primarily from subscriptions to our financial data  wireless internet and messaging and online trading services 
our strategy includes development of other services in other industries 
because of this change in focus and our recent acquisitions  you should not rely on our past performance to evaluate our future performance 
there is no established market for our services  we may not be able to sell enough of our services to become profitable 
the markets for wireless data and transaction services are still emerging 
continued growth in demand for  and acceptance of  these services remains uncertain 
current barriers to market acceptance of these services include cost  reliability  functionality and ease of use 
we cannot be certain that these barriers will be overcome 
we are currently developing services for some of our business customers pursuant to preliminary agreements  and expect to develop other aether products 
we cannot assure you that these parties will enter into contracts for our services or that products developed for future sale will result in revenue 
our competitors may develop alternative wireless data communications systems that gain broader market acceptance than our systems 
if the market for our services does not grow  or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  we may not be able to attract customers for our services and our revenues would be adversely affected 
our customers include technology companies that may be experiencing shortages in capital 
this could result in reduced sales to these companies and difficulty in collecting outstanding receivables 
during and  a portion of our revenues came from newly formed technology based companies  including companies in which we have made investments 
revenues from companies in which we have investments  including omnisky  inciscent  mindsurf  ephones  and parkstone  were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accounts receivable from these companies at december  and were  and million  respectively 
all of our investments were made in participation with other unrelated investors at the same per share price as the other investors 
our investment policy generally limits our investments to companies that have completed at least two rounds of financing and generally requires that an unrelated investor lead the round of financing that we participate in 
newly formed technology based companies have a limited operating history and many have reported significant losses since inception 
they are subject to many of the risks and uncertainties that we are  including rapid changes in technology  no established markets for their products  and intense competition  among others 
in addition  many of these companies may require significant infusions of capital to continue operations 
the availability of such capital has been curtailed and some of these companies may not be able to raise sufficient funds to continue to operate  which could limit our ability to generate further revenues from such companies as well as to collect their outstanding receivables 
our recent acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances may not deliver the value we paid or will pay for them 
excessive expenses may result if we do not successfully integrate them  or if the costs and management resources we expend in connection with the integrations exceed our expectations 
we expect that our recent acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances and any acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances we may pursue in the future will have a continuing  significant impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the value of the companies that we acquired or invested in may be less than the amount we paid and our financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to assimilate the acquired assets with our pre existing business  we lose key employees of these companies or of aether as a result of the acquisitions  our management s attention is diverted by other business concerns  or we assume unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets 
in addition  the companies we have acquired or invested in or may acquire or invest in are subject to each of the business risks we describe in this section  and if they incur any of these risks the businesses may not be as valuable as the amount we paid 
further  we cannot guarantee that we will realize the benefits or strategic objectives we were seeking to obtain by acquiring or investing in these companies 
we may have to take actions that are disruptive to our business strategy to avoid registration under the investment company act of as part of our business strategy  we own minority and majority equity interests in a number of ventures 
while we believe we are not currently an investment company  our ownership of these securities could potentially subject us to registration under the investment company act of  which  absent an applicable exclusion or exemption  requires registration for companies that are engaged primarily in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities 
if we were required to register as an investment company  we would not be able to continue operating our business in accordance with our business plan 
accordingly  we intend to take all necessary steps to avoid being deemed an investment company 
these necessary steps might disrupt our business strategy of forming joint ventures with strategic partners and making equity investments in companies with whom we have a strategic relationship to develop new technology or extend the reach of existing products and services 
a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding of its total assets excluding cash items and government securities as defined in the investment company act  subject to certain exclusions and exemptions 
any acquisition or disposition of assets  or fluctuations in the value of our assets may require us to take steps to avoid registration under the investment company act 
in particular  a write down of the value of our acquisitions such as those that may occur as a result of the recent market downturn  could increase the percentage of our total assets accounted for by investment securities 
the steps required to avoid registration could include buying  refraining from buying  selling or refraining from selling securities in circumstances where we would not take these actions except to avoid registration under the investment company act 
for example  we may have to retain majority or controlling interests in our joint ventures after their initial public offerings  which would require us to expend significant amounts of capital that we might otherwise use to expand our products and services in other market segments 
moreover  we may incur tax liabilities if we are required to sell assets 
we may also be unable to purchase additional investment securities that may be important to our business strategy 
we have applied to the sec for an exemptive order declaring that we are not an investment company and are not required to register under the investment company act 
we may not ultimately be successful in receiving such an order 
we may not achieve profitability if we are unable to maintain  improve and develop the wireless data services we offer 
we believe that our future business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our current services and to develop new ones on a timely basis 
our services will have to achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our service offerings  major new wireless data services and service enhancements require long development and testing periods 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new services and service enhancements 
additionally  our new services and service enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
if we cannot effectively develop and improve services we may not be able to recover our fixed costs or otherwise become profitable 
if we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change  our services may become obsolete and we may lose sales 
the wireless and data communications industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  industry standards  customer needs and competition  as well as by frequent new product and service introductions 
our services are integrated with wireless handheld devices and the computer systems of our corporate customers 
our services must also be compatible with the data networks of wireless carriers 
we must respond to technological changes affecting both our customers and suppliers 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new services that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accomplish all of the following in a timely and cost effective manner effectively use and integrate new wireless and data technologies  continue to develop our technical expertise  enhance our wireless data  engineering and system design services  develop applications for new wireless networks  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes 
we depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers such as verizon wireless  bell south corporation  motient and at t wireless and on the reliability and security of their systems 
all of our services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties 
we depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and bug free service and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service 
in addition  our expenses would increase and our profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services 
our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one year terms 
some of these wireless carriers are  or could become  our competitors and if they compete with us they may refuse to provide us with their services 
our failure to develop recognition for the aether brand could prevent us from achieving a profitable level of sales 
our expenses related to sales and marketing activities were  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we intend to increase the market presence of our brand over time and continue to focus on generating leads and sales opportunities  which will require us to continue our increased spending on sales and marketing 
we have applied for  but have not received  federal trademark registrations for the names aether tm  and aether systems tm and as well as names of key products 
we may not be able to use these names effectively or at all if we fail to obtain such registrations due to conflicting marks or otherwise 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we expect to market our acquired products and services under their existing brands 
we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers if these brands are not well received by our customers  if our marketing efforts are not productive  if we are otherwise unsuccessful in increasing our brand awareness or if our competition has greater brand recognition 
we depend on third parties for the marketing and sales of some of our services 
if the marketing efforts of these third parties are not effective  we may not achieve a profitable level of sales 
we rely substantially on the efforts of others to market and sell some of our wireless data communications services  in particular the online trading services 
we also expect to rely on the marketing efforts of our strategic relationship partners for products under development in our other market segments such as healthcare and wireless commerce 
we cannot control whether or how these third parties who sell and market our services will perform their obligations to market our services 
if these third parties fail to market our services or their efforts fail to result in new customers  we may be unable to attract new customers and our revenue could be adversely affected 
we may fail to support our anticipated growth in operations  which could reduce demand for our services and materially adversely affect our revenue 
our business strategy is based on the assumption that the number of subscribers to our services  the amount of information they want to receive and the number of services we offer will all increase 
we must continue to develop and expand our systems and operations to accommodate this growth 
the expansion and adaptation of our customer service and network operations centers require substantial financial  operational and management resources 
we may be unable to expand our operations for one or more of the following reasons we may not be able to locate or hire at reasonable compensation rates qualified engineers and other employees necessary to expand our capacity  we may not be able to expand our billing and other related support systems  and we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional capacity from wireless carriers 
due to the limited deployment of our services to date  the ability of our systems and operations to connect and manage a substantially larger number of customers while maintaining superior performance is unknown 
any failure on our part to develop and maintain our wireless data services as we experience rapid growth could significantly reduce demand for our services and materially adversely affect our revenue 
we depend on recruiting and retaining key management and technical personnel with wireless data and software experience 
we may not be able to develop new products or support existing products if we cannot hire or retain qualified employees 
because of the technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete  our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees 
competition for qualified personnel in the wireless data and software industries is intense and finding qualified personnel with experience in both industries is even more difficult 
we believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills in the field of wireless data communication  and it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire and retain these persons 
competitors and others have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to recruit our employees 
each of our engineers has entered into a non competition agreement with us for a period of ten months after they leave aether 
these agreements will not prevent our engineers from leaving or working for competitors relatively soon after they leave us 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy for david s 
oros  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we do not maintain insurance policies for any of our other executive officers 
we may not have adequately protected our intellectual property rights  which could allow competitors to develop similar products using similar technology  thus reducing our sales and revenue 
we have attempted to protect our technology  including the technology we have obtained or will obtain in our acquisitions  through patent  trademark and copyright protection  as well as through trade secret laws and non competition and non disclosure agreements with all employees 
patents may infringe on valid patents held by third parties  or patents held by third parties may limit the scope of any patents we receive 
in particular  the patent we acquired in our acquisition of riverbed covers a technology that is similar to other patented technologies 
in addition  we have applied for but have as yet no international patent protection in this technology 
if we are not adequately protected  other companies with sufficient engineering expertise could develop competing products based on our intellectual property and reduce our sales and revenue 
we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur costs of defense and possibly royalties or lose the right to use technology important to providing our services 
the telecommunications and software industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of participants in our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us could increase 
intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  could require us to enter into costly royalty arrangements  could divert management attention from administering our business and could hinder us from conducting our business 
we may be subject to liability for transmitting information  and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from this liability 
we may be subject to claims relating to information transmitted over systems we develop or operate 
these claims could take the form of lawsuits for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other actions based on the nature and content of the materials 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
disruption of our services due to accidental or intentional security breaches may harm our reputation  potentially causing a loss of sales and an increase in our expenses 
a significant barrier to the growth of wireless data services or transactions on the internet or by other electronic means has been the need for secure transmission of confidential information 
our systems could be disrupted by unauthorized access  computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
if a third party were able to misappropriate our users personal or proprietary information or credit card information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our revenue and may result in the loss of customers 
any type of systems failure could reduce sales  increase costs or result in claims of liability 
our existing wireless data services are dependent on real time  continuous feeds from reuters selectfeed plus and others 
the ability of our subscribers to make securities trades  receive sales leads and receive critical business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers 
any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could result in delays in our subscribers ability to receive information or execute trades 
we cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience a hardware or software failure or if there is an earthquake  fire or other natural disaster  a power or telecommunications failure  intentional disruptions of service by third parties  an act of god or an act of war 
a failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data  and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business 
our ability to sell new and existing services at a profit could be impaired by competitors 
intense competition could develop in the market for services we offer 
we developed our software using standard industry development tools 
many of our agreements with wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers and data providers are non exclusive 
our competitors could develop and use the same products and services in competition with us 
with time and capital  it would be possible for competitors to replicate our services 
our potential competitors could include wireless network carriers such as verizon wireless and at t wireless  software developers such as microsoft corporation  solutions and openwave systems and systems integrators such as ibm 
many of our potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  competitors may develop a different approach to marketing the services we provide in which subscribers may not be required to pay for the information provided by our services 
competition could reduce our market share or force us to lower prices to unprofitable levels 
we may lose the opportunity to pursue desirable projects to inciscent  omnisky  sila and mindsurf and other companies in which we hold equity interests  because some of our directors and executive officers serve on the boards of directors of these companies 
david s 
oros  our chairman and chief executive officer  and some of our other executive officers and directors have been appointed to the boards of directors of companies in which we hold an equity interest  including omnisky  sila  mindsurf and inciscent 
these other companies may develop products that compete with our own products 
mr 
oros and the other directors and executive officers may learn of business opportunities that are appropriate for the boards on which they serve and mr 
oros and these other individuals may not be required to make those opportunities available to us 
if omnisky  sila  inciscent  mindsurf or any other joint ventures we may enter into pursue opportunities that we would have an interest in pursuing  our business may fail to grow or our existing business may suffer 
mr 
oros and these other directors and executive officers may also have other conflicts of interest with aether because of their positions with omnisky  sila  inciscent and mindsurf and omnisky s  sila s  inciscent s and mindsurf s contractual relationships with aether 
an interruption in the supply of products and services that we obtain from third parties could cause a decline in sales of our services  and products we purchase to avoid shortages may become obsolete before we can use them 
in designing  developing and supporting our wireless data services  we rely on wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers  content providers and software providers 
these suppliers may experience difficulty in supplying us products or services sufficient to meet our needs or they may terminate or fail to renew contracts for supplying us these products or services on terms we find acceptable 
any significant interruption in the supply of any of these products or services could cause a decline in sales of our services unless and until we are able to replace the functionality provided by these products and services 
rim is our primary provider of pager devices 
novatel and sierra wireless  inc are our only suppliers of wireless modems  which are an integral hardware component of our services 
it can be difficult to obtain these wireless modems and their parts 
although we have purchased a large supply of these modems  they may become obsolete before we are able to use them 
we also depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
in addition  we rely on the ability of our content providers including reuters  the new york stock exchange  inc  the chicago board of trade  the nasdaq stock market  inc 
and the options price reporting authority to continue to provide us with uninterrupted access to the news and financial information we provide to our customers 
the failure of third parties to meet these criteria  or their refusal or failure to deliver the information for whatever reason  could materially harm our business 
our sales cycle is long  and our stock price could decline if sales are delayed or cancelled 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating performance are exacerbated by the length of time between our first contact with a business customer and the first revenue from sales of services to that customer or end users 
because our services represent a significant investment for our business customers  we spend a substantial amount of time educating them regarding the use and benefits of our services and they  in turn  spend a substantial amount of time performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals before purchasing our services 
as much as a year may elapse between the time we approach a business customer and the time we begin to deliver services to a customer or end user 
any delay in sales of our services could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly from projected results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  we may spend a significant amount of time and money on a potential customer that ultimately does not purchase our services 
our sales of financial data and trading services could decrease if there is a decline in securities trading 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from services that provide financial information and wireless trading capability 
if there is a prolonged decline in the overall level of securities trading  or online trading in particular  our operating results may decline 
a prolonged decline in securities trading may result from loss of confidence in the reliability or security of online trading systems  government regulation of the securities industry or online trading  or a prolonged downturn or volatility in the stock market 
our software may contain defects or errors  and our sales could go down if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software 
our software products and platforms are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
we must develop our services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets 
software as complex as ours is likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
our software may not be free from errors or defects after delivery to customers has begun  which could result in the rejection of our software or services  damage to our reputation  lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased service and warranty costs 
new laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase our costs or reduce our opportunities to earn revenue 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses in general 
however  in the future  we may become subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
in addition  the wireless carriers who supply us airtime and certain of our hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the fcc and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services 
we conduct operations in a number of countries through sila and other subsidiaries and are subject to risks of international operations 
we currently operate outside the us through sila and other subsidiaries  which have operations throughout europe and asia 
we expect that sila s management will independently perform the day to day operations of our joint venture and will not be within our day to day control 
any failure by sila and other subsidiaries to successfully implement or maintain services could result in negative publicity and have an unfavorable impact on our ability to expand our products and services to europe and asia 
we face various risks in expanding outside the us  including difficulty and cost of monitoring our international operations  cultural differences in the conduct of business  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  and recessionary or inflationary environments in foreign economies  particularly in asian countries and in the financial services sector 
we cannot ensure that our international operations will contribute positively to our business  financial condition or result of operations 
our failure to manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in international markets 
in addition  our expanding operations outside the us are  in some instances  conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could cause currency exchange losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
as a result of the million of convertible subordinated notes due currently outstanding  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  primarily consisting of the notes 
as a result of this indebtedness  we are obligated to make principal and interest payments 
there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing arrangements will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
substantially all of our excess funds are invested in cash equivalents with maturities of less than ninety days 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term low risk instruments 
at december   we had million invested in money market  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
a rise in interest rates would have an adverse impact on the fair value of fixed rate securities 
if interest rates fall  floating rate securities may generate less interest income 
because of the short term nature of our cash equivalents  we do not believe that we are exposed to significant interest rate risks on these instruments 
at december   we have million in investments with maturities that range from less than one year to ten years 
while these instruments expose us to some risks  we do not believe that the amount of these investments is significant 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate subordinated convertible notes payable 
the fair value of this fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
if market rates decline  the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policy  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our risk of interest rate fluctuations 
we do not believe such risk is material to our results of operations 
since the acquisition of ifx and the related formation of sila and the commencement of us sales to foreign countries  we have been exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
all sales from the us to foreign countries have been denominated in us dollars 
since the revenue and expenses of sila generally are denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the us dollar will subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of sila as well as risks sometimes associated with international operations 
the countries in which sila has operations have traditionally had relatively stable currencies 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure 
we do not believe that our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is material at this time
