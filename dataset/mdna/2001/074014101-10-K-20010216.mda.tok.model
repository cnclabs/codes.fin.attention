item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the results discussed below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future periods 
general a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on three factors 
a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  
the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and 
the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
in  we generated of our revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff 
we generated of our revenues from national spot advertising in  which is purchased through independent  national advertising sales representatives by customers that want to advertise nationwide 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from promotional events and sales to broadcasting networks that purchase commercial airtime 
we include revenues recognized under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement for radio stations operated by us before acquiring the radio stations in net revenues  while we reflect operating expenses associated with these radio stations in station operating expenses 
consequently  there is no difference in the method of revenue and operating expense recognition between a radio station operated by us under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement and a radio station owned and operated by us 
for the periods discussed below  revenues and operating expenses under time brokerage agreements or similar sales agreements were not material for years subsequent to since  we have not operated any stations under time brokerage agreements or other similar sales agreements 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase listenership and arbitron ratings 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly in most of our markets  any increased ratings  and therefore increased advertising revenues  tend to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional spending 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our spot inventory  we minimize our use of trade agreements and during the past five years have held barter revenues under of our gross revenues and barter related broadcast cash flow under of our broadcast cash flow 
however  barter revenues increased as a percentage of our gross revenues and barter related broadcast cash flow increased as a percentage of our broadcast cash flow in fiscal due to our investments in etour  inc and findwhat 
com 
we calculate same station results by comparing the performance of radio stations operated by us at the end of a relevant period to the performance of those same stations  whether or not operated by us  in the prior year s corresponding period  including the effect of barter revenues and expenses 
same station results exclude wptp fm in the philadelphia market which changed formats during the fourth quarter of broadcast cash flow consists of operating income before corporate general and administrative expenses  equity appreciation rights  format change expenses  and depreciation and amortization  and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
same station broadcast cash flow is the broadcast cash flow of the radio stations included in our same station calculations 
for purposes of the following discussion  pro forma net income represents historical income before income taxes adjusted as if we were treated as a subchapter c corporation during all relevant periods at an effective tax rate of  applied to income before income taxes 
results of operations several factors have affected our results of operations in the year ended december  that did not affect our historical results of operations 
first  we redeemed  for cash  equity appreciation rights previously granted to some of our station managers  as we do not believe this form of compensation is well suited to public companies 
in connection with this redemption  we recorded an expense of approximately  and  in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively 
second  in connection with our reorganization on february   our net stockholders equity was reduced by approximately million to establish the net deferred tax liability resulting from the termination of our subchapter s status 
third  in connection with the format change at wptp fm in the philadelphia market on november   we recorded one time expenses of approximately million during the fourth quarter of finally  corporate general and administrative expenses have increased as we incur the additional reporting and compliance costs of operating as a public company 
additionally  we have one contract that will continue to negatively affect our operating results going forward 
in  we entered into contracts for the radio broadcast rights relating to the miami dolphins  florida marlins and florida panthers sports franchises 
these contracts grant wqam am the exclusive  english language rights for live radio broadcasts of the sporting events of these franchises for a five year term which began in the contracts require us to pay fees and to provide commercial advertising and other considerations 
as of december   remaining payments of fees are as follows million in and  in for the years ended december   and  the contract expense calculated on a straight line basis and other direct expenses exceeded related revenues by   and  respectively 
unless we are able to generate significantly more revenues under these contracts in the future  they are likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations on a going forward basis 
however  in light of the uncertainty regarding future revenues  the amount of any future loss cannot be determined at this time

liquidity and capital resources overview 
historically  we have used a significant portion of our liquidity to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions have been funded from one or a combination of the following sources 
our credit facility  
disposing of radio stations in transactions which are intended to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code  
internally generated cash flow  and 
advances to us from george g 
beasley  members of his family and affiliated entities 
other liquidity needs have been for debt service  working capital  distributions to equity holders and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
in the future  we expect that our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions of additional radio stations 
we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of bank borrowings  internally generated funds and our stock 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to pay down debt on our credit facility  which increased the availability of cash to fund future acquisitions  including the recently completed and pending acquisitions  and other general corporate purposes 
we also used approximately million of the proceeds of our initial public offering to repay the indebtedness owed to our chairman and chief executive officer  george g 
beasley  and affiliated companies 
that approximately million payment is net of the repayment at the closing of the initial public offering of approximately million owed to us by members of the beasley family 
as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and had million in availability under our credit facility we obtained on august   as described below 
we completed one acquisition on january  with an aggregate purchase price of million and we have one pending acquisition with an aggregate purchase price of million 
we believe that the cash available from operations as well as the availability from our credit facility should be sufficient to permit us to meet our financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
under our credit facility  we can currently borrow up to million  subject to compliance with financial ratios and other restrictive covenants 
net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively

lauderdale and west palm beach markets and expenditures for property and equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility incur interest at the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus additional basis points depending on the outstanding principal balance under the credit facility 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility 
we evaluate our exposure to interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest rates in the market place 
to manage interest rate risk associated with our credit agreement  we have entered into interest rate collar and swap agreements 
an interest rate collar is the combined purchase and sale of an interest rate cap and an interest rate floor so as to keep interest rate exposure within a defined range 
we have purchased four interest rate collars 
under these agreements  our base libor cannot exceed the cap interest rate and our base libor cannot fall below our floor interest rate 
in february  one interest rate collar was canceled and we purchased another interest rate collar 
an interest rate swap is a combined series of forward rate agreements calling for exchange of interest payments on a number of specified future dates 
we have purchased one interest rate swap 
under this agreement  we pay a fixed rate of  on the notional amount  and the other party pays to us a variable amount rate equal to the three month libor on a quarterly basis 
in february  our swap agreement was canceled 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
as of december  and february   the notional amount upon maturity of these collar and swap agreements  is approximately million and million  respectively
