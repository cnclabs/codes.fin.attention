item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction in management s discussion and analysis we explain our general financial condition and operating results  including what factors impact our business what our earnings and costs were in  and why these earnings and costs differed from year to year how our earnings and costs affect our overall financial condition what we expect our capital expenditures to be for the years through how we plan to pay for these future capital expenditures other items we believe may materially affect our financial condition or earnings as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
these statements show our operating results for  and in management s discussion and analysis  we analyze and explain the significant annual changes of specific line items in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
summary of significant activities net loss 
we incurred a net loss of million in a net loss of million excluding extraordinary gains of million  net of tax 
this net loss reflects a decline in revenues and substantial charges incurred by us for amortization of customer accounts and goodwill and interest incurred on indebtedness 
we do not expect to have earnings in the foreseeable future 
related party transactions 
on february   the company sold its european operations and certain investments to westar industries 
the consideration received was approximately million  comprised of approximately million in cash and certain of the company s outstanding debt securities westar industries had acquired in open market purchases for approximately million 
as part of the agreement  westar industries agreed to pay protection one a portion of the net gain  if any  on a subsequent sale of the business on a declining basis over the four years following the closing 
the cash proceeds of the sale were used to reduce the million outstanding balance under the million senior credit facility between the company and westar industries 
since westar industries is a related party  no gain or loss was recorded on the sale of our european operations and investments 
we increased additional paid in capital million to reflect the excess of the transaction price over carrying value on the sale of the european operations 
we reduced additional paid in capital million to reflect the excess of the carrying amount of the investments over the transaction price 
amendment to credit agreement with westar industries 
in december  our senior credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date to march  and to increase the interest rate to reflect current market conditions 
on february   the senior credit facility was further amended to  among other things  further extend the maturity date to january  extinguishment of debt and extraordinary gain 
during we reduced our debt by million primarily through the sale of our european operations and purchases of debt securities from westar industries 
we reduced outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility by million 
we reduced million in carrying value of our public debt by acquiring million face value of our bonds from westar industries and million face value of our bonds in open market purchases  all of which were retired 
an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax of million  was recorded on these retirements 
change in estimate of useful life of goodwill 
in january  we re evaluated the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated useful life of goodwill 
management concluded that due to continued losses  levels of attrition experienced in and other factors  the estimated useful life of goodwill should be reduced from years to years as of january  after that date  remaining goodwill  net of accumulated amortization is being amortized over its remaining useful life based on a year life 
the change in estimate resulted in additional goodwill amortization for the year ended december  of million 
the resulting reduction to net income for the year was million  or a decrease in earnings per share of impairment test 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed an impairment test of our customer accounts and related goodwill under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
paragraph of sfas indicates that an impairment loss should be recognized only if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the assets grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
after performing the test  we determined that there was not an impairment 
monthly recurring revenue 
at various times during the year  we measure all of the monthly revenue we are entitled to receive under contracts with customers in effect at the end of the period 
we had approximately million and million million excluding european operations of monthly recurring revenue as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of our net loss of  customers during in  we experienced a steady decline in our customer base 
we are unable to predict the amount of acquired monthly recurring revenue that will be realized in future periods or the impact of the losses of acquired accounts on our overall rate of customer loss 
our computation of monthly recurring revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and monthly recurring revenue should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to actual monthly revenue  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our monthly recurring revenue includes amounts billable to customers with past due balances 
we seek to preserve the revenue stream associated with each customer contract  primarily to maximize our return on the investment we made to generate each contract 
as a result  we actively work to collect amounts owed to us and to retain the customer at the same time 
in some instances  we may allow up to six months to collect past due amounts  while evaluating the ongoing customer relationship 
after we have made every reasonable effort to collect past due balances  we will disconnect the customer and include the loss in attrition calculations 
customer creation and marketing 
for the year ended december   our north america segment added  accounts  although our net number of customers decreased by  accounts net of  accounts acquired in the powercall acquisition 
the multifamily segment added  accounts  with its net number of customers increasing by  accounts 
while our previous customer acquisition strategy for north america relied primarily on our dealer program  our new customer acquisition strategy relies on a mix of internal sales  tuck in acquisitions  direct marketing and dealers 
the number of accounts being purchased through our dealer program decreased significantly from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  for the three months ended december   our dealer program produced  accounts  or approximately of the total number of north america accounts acquired during such period excluding the powercall acquisition of  accounts 
in february  we started a commission only internal sales program  with a goal of acquiring accounts at a cost lower than our external programs 
we currently have a commissioned sales force of over persons which we plan to expand in this program utilizes our existing branch infrastructure in approximately markets 
the internal sales program generated  accounts in we expect the number of accounts produced by this program to increase as it becomes more established 
we continually evaluate our customer creation and marketing strategy  including each respective channel for economic returns  volume and other factors and may shift our strategy or focus  including the elimination of a particular channel 
attrition 
like most monitored security companies  we invest significant amounts to generate new customers  and we seek to maintain long term relationships with our customers by providing excellent service 
we measure the loss of our customers to verify that our investment in new customers is generating a satisfactory rate of return and that our amortization policy is reasonable 
we define attrition as a ratio  the numerator of which is the number of lost customer accounts for a primarily given period  net of certain adjustments  and the denominator of which is the average number of accounts for a given period 
in some instances the company uses estimates to derive attrition data 
we make adjustments to lost accounts primarily for the net change  either positive or negative  in our wholesale base and for accounts which are covered under a purchase price holdback and are put back to the seller 
we reduce the gross accounts lost during a period by the amount of the guarantee provided for in the purchase agreements with sellers 
in some cases  the amount of the purchase holdback may be less than actual attrition experience we expect adjustments to lost accounts for purchase holdbacks will be lower in the future because we are purchasing fewer accounts in the types of transactions that create holdbacks and we have extinguished a substantial portion of our purchase holdback reserve 
our actual attrition experience shows that the relationship period with any individual customer can vary significantly 
customers discontinue service for a variety of reasons  including relocation  service issues and cost 
a portion of the acquired customer base can be expected to discontinue service every year 
any significant change in the pattern of our historical attrition experience would have a material effect on our results of operations 
we monitor attrition each quarter based on a quarterly annualized and trailing twelve month basis 
this method utilizes each segment s average customer account base for the applicable period in measuring attrition 
therefore  in periods of customer account growth  customer attrition may be understated and in periods of customer account decline  customer attrition may be overstated 
for the period ended december   our total company quarterly annualized and trailing twelve month attrition rates were and  respectively 
the table below shows the change in our total company customer base excluding the european segment including customer additions and attrited customers from to year ended december  beginning balance  january     additions    customer losses not guaranteed with holdback put backs   customer losses guaranteed with holdback put backs and other  ending balance  december     results of operation we separate our business into two reportable segments north america and multifamily 
north america provides security alarm monitoring services  which include sales  installation and related servicing of security alarm systems in the united states and canada 
multifamily provides security alarm services to apartments  condominiums and other multi family dwellings 
north america segment we present the table below to show how the north america operating results have changed over the past three years 
next to each year s results of operation  we provide the relevant percentage of total revenues so that you can make comparisons about the relative change in revenues and expenses 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues monitoring and related services   other    total revenues    cost of revenues monitoring and related services   other    total cost of revenues    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses  acquisition and transition expense   amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense  other charges    operating income loss    includes million and million of corporate expenses for and  respectively 
in  such expenses were not separately identified 
includes million of corporate expenses relating to a failed merger attempt in compared to we had a net decrease of  customers net of  customers acquired in the acquisition of powercall in as compared to a net increase of  customers in the average customer base was  for compared to  for the number of customers decreased primarily because our customer acquisition strategies were not able to generate accounts in a sufficient volume at acceptable cost to replace accounts lost through attrition 
we expect that this trend will continue until the efforts we are making to acquire new accounts and reduce attrition become more successful than they have been to date 
until we are able to reverse this trend  net losses of customer accounts will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our focus remains on the completion of our current infrastructure projects  the development of cost effective marketing programs  development of our commercial business and the generation of positive cash flow 
further analysis between the two years is discussed below 
beginning balance  january     additions    customer losses not guaranteed with holdback put backs   customer losses guaranteed with holdback put backs and other  ending balance  december     twelve month trailing attrition monitoring and related service revenues for decreased by million  or  to million from million for the decrease is primarily due to the decline in our customer base 
these revenues consist primarily of contractual revenue derived from providing monitoring and maintenance service 
other revenues increased by to million in  compared to million in these revenues consist primarily of outright sales of burglar alarms  closed circuit television  fire alarms and card access control systems 
cost of monitoring and related services revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for cost of monitoring and related services revenues as a percentage of the related revenues increased from in to in compensation costs for the monitoring stations increased by approximately million due primarily to an increase in personnel 
in addition  parts and materials costs increased by million and vehicle costs increased million 
these costs generally relate to the cost of providing monitoring service and include the costs of monitoring  billing  customer service and field operations 
cost of other revenues for decreased by million  or  to million from million in parts and materials decreased by million and labor costs increased by million 
these costs consist primarily of equipment and labor charges to install alarm systems  closed circuit televisions  fire alarms and card access control systems sold outright to our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased by million  or  to million from million in  but increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in selling expense increased million to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to an increase in sales commissions stemming from our increased emphasis on internal account growth which we believe will further increase as we continue to grow our internal sales force 
bad debt and collection expenses decreased approximately million primarily due to increased collection efforts in subcontract expense for outside information technology support increased approximately million due primarily to work performed in connection with the implementation of our new billing  collection and monitoring software 
acquisition expenses for decreased by million  or  to million from million in third party monitoring costs decreased by million  signs and decals expense decreased by million  printing expense decreased by million and compensation expense decreased by million 
these decreases are a direct result of the significant decline in the number of new accounts acquired from  in to  accounts acquired in this decline is primarily due to the restructuring of our dealer program 
the decrease in third party monitoring expense and associated increase in reprogramming expense are a result of our concentrated effort in late to move such accounts to our own monitoring stations 
additionally  in the third quarter of  million of costs relating to the termination of the lifeline merger were expensed 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense for increased by million  or  to million from million in subscriber amortization for and was million and million respectively  a decrease of million 
we changed the amortization method on most of our customer base from a year straight line method to a year declining balance method as of the third quarter in the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was approximately million including approximately million of additional amortization from the effect of the change on amortization in years prior to this change does not include our westinghouse customer pool for which we adopted an year accelerated amortization method from the date of the wss acquisition 
as discussed above  we also changed our estimate of the useful life of goodwill from years to years 
as a result  our goodwill amortization expense increased million from million in to million in additionally  in  depreciation expense increased million from million in to million 
this increase is due to accelerated depreciation of the general ledger and accounts receivable systems installed in in  we moved to another general ledger and accounts receivable system better suited to meet our needs 
other charges for consisted of officers severance costs of million and million in non recurring costs incurred to transition certain back office functions from irving  texas to topeka  kansas 
for these charges consist of million for officers severance  million for expenses relating to the sale of the european operations  and million in costs relating to the closing of our chatsworth  california and culver city  california offices 
interest expense  net for and was million and million  respectively 
this decrease is primarily a result of the reduction of approximately million in outstanding debt during compared to we had a net increase of  customers in as compared to a net increase of  customers in accordingly  results for include a full year of operations with the customers added throughout we believe this to be the primary reason for our increase in revenues and associated cost of revenues in as compared to further analysis between the two years is discussed below 
monitoring and related service revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for the primary reason for the increase in revenues is because we had a full year of revenues from the additional customers added throughout an increase in our base monitoring and service fees also increased revenue in other revenues which consist primarily of revenues generated from our internal installations of new alarm systems  decreased by to million in  compared to million in this decrease in revenues is due primarily to the reduction of our internal sales and installation activities that resulted from our reliance on the dealer program for residential customers in we continued our internal sales program and recorded installation revenues through the first half of  but then relied almost entirely on the dealer program to acquire new customers for the balance of and all of cost of monitoring and related services revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for cost of monitoring and related services revenues as a percentage of the related revenues decreased from during to during monitoring and related services expense for increased primarily due to a full year of operations of our three major service centers and three smaller satellite monitoring facilities acquired in we also incurred additional expense in relating to the addition of customer service representatives in the second quarter 
cost of other revenues for decreased by million  or  to million from million in this decrease corresponds with the decrease in the internal installations in other cost of revenues as a percentage of other revenues increased to in from in gross profit for increased by million  or  to million from million in contribution of new customers through our dealer program and acquisitions produced the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit was for compared to for the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues reflects cost savings from the consolidation of some of our monitoring operations  offset by a partial year of expense associated with additional customer service representatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase is attributable to costs associated with the overall increase in the average number of customers billed  additional bad debt expense of approximately million resulting from higher attrition  costs associated with year compliance  professional fees and salary increases 
acquisition expenses for increased by million  or to million from million in we aggregate expenses incurred in the acquisition and integration of customers in this line item 
these expenses include yard signs  the cost of monitoring acquired accounts by a third party  and the reprogramming of alarm panels for new customers 
the increase in is primarily attributable to costs of million associated with the restructuring of our dealer program and million of costs related to the unsuccessful merger with lifeline  offset by reduced transition expenses associated with acquisitions 
in we incurred million in additional customer transition expenses  primarily yard signs for wrsb customers related to the merger of wrsb and protection one 
we incurred expenses to develop and manage our dealer program  as well as to contact  assimilate and solicit acquired and new customers for new services 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense for increased by million  or  to million from million in in  we changed our amortization method for most of our north american customers from a year straight line method to a year declining balance method which substantially increased amortization expense 
another primary factor resulting in the increase is the full year of amortization expense on subscribers acquired during these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the amortization of the westinghouse customers under the year accelerated amortization method 
other charges for increased by million  to million from million in we incurred million for severance and relocation expenses associated with a reorganization of our operations in and million for such expenses in late interest expense  net for increased by million  or  to million from million in  reflecting our use of debt to finance a substantial portion of our customer account growth 
other non recurring income expense in totaled million of income compared to million of income in in  other income consisted primarily of a gain on the sale of our mobile services group of million and dividend income reduced by losses on sales of marketable securities of million 
in  we recognized a non recurring gain on the repurchase of customer contracts covered by a financing arrangement with new york life secured asset management company  ltd 
samco  a third party  of approximately million 
also during  we restructured our investment in a security monitoring company and recognized a non recurring gain of approximately million 
multifamily segment the following table provides information for comparison of the multifamily operating results for the periods presented 
next to each period s results of operations  we provide the relevant percentage of total revenues so that comparisons about the relative change in revenues and expenses can be made 
year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues monitoring and related services   other    total revenues    cost of revenues monitoring and related services   other    total cost of revenues    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses acquisition and transition expense amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense  operating income    compared to we had a net increase of  customers in as compared to a net increase of  customers in the average customer base was  for compared to  for the change in multifamily s customer base for the period is shown below 
year ended december  beginning balance  january     additions  net of holdback put backs    customer losses  net of holdback put backs    ending balance  december     twelve month trailing attrition the increase in the attrition rate for multifamily in is due to nonpayment of approximately  subscribers related to one developer 
had these accounts not attrited  the annualized attrition would have been approximately 
we are pursuing contractual remedies for nonpayment of these accounts 
monitoring and related services revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for multifamily s additional revenues in were primarily attributable to the increase in the subscriber base 
these revenues consist primarily of contractual revenue derived from providing monitoring and maintenance service 
other revenues decreased by 
million or to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in the number of outright sales installations 
cost of monitoring and related service revenues for increased by 
million  or  to million from million for monitoring and related service expenses  as a percentage of monitoring and related service revenues  increased to for from for this increase is primarily related to increased employment costs caused by the current competitive labor market and an increase in claims experience on a self funded medical insurance plan 
cost of other revenues decreased by 
million or to million from million in other cost of revenues  as a percentage of other revenues  decreased to in from in this decline is principally due to an increase in sales of access control contracts with greater installation margins than the standard alarm sale and the access control sales installed in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased 
million or to million in from million in primarily due to a temporary decline in the sales force 
acquisition expenses for were zero and 
million in we aggregate expenses incurred in the acquisition and integration of customers in this line item 
these expenses principally relate to the conversion of customer account data into multifamily s monitoring database from acquisitions made in amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense for increased by million  or to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the change in estimate of goodwill life from years to years resulting in an increase in goodwill amortization expense of million 
subscriber amortization increased by million due to the larger customer base being amortized 
compared to during over  accounts were acquired in two acquisitions that increased monthly recurring revenues by approximately  or million per year 
about  of these accounts were acquired in may with the balance acquired in september 
the results reflect a full year of operations with these acquired accounts which is the primary reason that revenues and associated expenses are higher in monitoring and related services revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for multifamily s additional revenues in were primarily attributable to the acquisitions 
cost of monitoring and related revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for monitoring and related services expenses as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenues increased to in from during the percentage increase is due primarily to the lower contracted recurring revenues on the accounts acquired in selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase resulted primarily from increased selling expense attributable to a increase in contract sales and increased general and administrative expenses principally associated with the acquisitions 
acquisition expenses for was million and zero in we aggregate expenses incurred in the acquisition and integration of customers in this line item 
these expenses principally relate to the conversion of customer account data into multifamily s monitoring database from the acquisitions 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense for increased by million  or  to million from million in we amortize customer accounts over years using a straight line method and goodwill over years using a straight line method 
liquidity and capital resources we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund future operations of our business through january  from a combination of revenue from our security monitoring customer base which generated million of positive ebitda  excluding our european operations  in and from borrowings under our existing senior credit facility  which had approximately million of availability at march  we will need to extend the maturity date of our senior credit facility with westar industries or refinance the facility with an unaffiliated lender to have sufficient cash to fund operations after january  see risk factors we will need to refinance our senior credit facility 
ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and is indicative neither of operating performance nor cash flows available to fund our cash needs 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
we believe that presentation of ebitda enhances an understanding of our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows because ebitda is used to satisfy our debt service obligations and our capital expenditures and other operational needs as well as to provide funds for growth 
in addition  ebitda is used by senior lenders and subordinated creditors and the investment community to determine the current borrowing capacity and to estimate the long term value of companies with recurring cash flows from operations 
our computation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
operating cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities provided net cash flows of million  an increase of million from this increase was primarily due to receipt of the and tax benefit payments from westar industries under our tax sharing agreement  offset by a decrease in deferred revenues 
the decline in deferred revenues was the result of a decline in our account base in as compared to an increase in our account base in we expect the tax benefit payments we will receive from western resources in will be smaller than the payments received in because of the extraordinary gains recognized in from the retirement of bonds which reduced the amount of our losses available to be utilized by western resources in its consolidated tax return 
investing cash flows during investing cash flows provided million of cash flow 
this was comprised of million of cash proceeds received from westar industries from the sale of our european operations and other investments  reduced by million used to acquire fixed assets  million used to acquire new customers and million related to the powercall acquisition 
financing cash flows during we used a net million in financing activities 
borrowings under our senior credit facility decreased by million 
we used the million in cash received from the sale of our european operations and other investments to reduce borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we paid an additional million to retire million carrying amount of other outstanding debt 
we also purchased million in treasury stock during the year 
borrowings under our senior credit facility in were at interest rates based on either the prime rate or a eurodollar rate 
at december  the facility had a weighted average interest rate of and an outstanding balance of million 
debt and equity repurchase plans 
we may from time to time purchase our debt and equity securities in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
the timing and terms of purchases  and the amount of debt or equity actually purchased  will be determined based on market conditions and other factors 
as of march   we had authority to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
material commitments 
we have future  material  long term commitments made in the past several years in connection with our growth 
we believe these commitments will be met through a combination of borrowings under our senior credit facility  refinancings and positive operating cash flows 
the following reflects these commitments as of december  in thousands debt security maturity date december  convertible senior subordinated notes a september  senior subordinated discount notes b june  senior unsecured notes august  senior subordinated notes january  senior credit facility c january  a these notes are convertible into protection one common stock at a price of per share  which is currently above the price at which our shares are traded in the public stock markets 
b does not include premium of million at december  c reflects amendments to the senior credit facility extending the maturity date to january  most of these debt instruments contain restrictions based on ebitda 
the definition of ebitda varies among the various indentures and the senior credit facility 
ebitda is generally derived by adding to income loss before income taxes  the sum of interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
however  under the varying definitions of the indentures  various and numerous additional adjustments are sometimes required 
our senior credit facility and the indentures relating to our public notes contain the financial covenants summarized below debt instrument financial covenant senior credit facility total consolidated debt annualized most recent quarter ebitda less than to a consolidated annualized most recent quarter ebitda latest four fiscal quarters interest expense greater than to b senior subordinated notes current fiscal quarter ebitda current fiscal quarter interest expense greater than to senior subordinated discount notes total debt annualized current quarter ebitda less than to senior debt annualized current quarter ebitda less than to a this covenant is reduced to to effective in the first quarter of b this covenant is increased to to effective in the first quarter of at december   we were in compliance with the covenants under the senior credit facility and the indentures relating to our public debt 
these debt instruments also restrict our ability to pay dividends to stockholders  but do not otherwise restrict our ability to fund cash obligations 
credit ratings 
on march  moody s downgraded their ratings on our outstanding securities and on march   moody s further downgraded these ratings citing concerns regarding our operations  leverage and liquidity over the intermediate term  with outlook remaining negative 
s p and fitch currently have our ratings on negative watch 
as of march  the ratings were as follows senior unsecured debt senior subordinated unsecured debt s p b b moody s b caa fitch b b capital expenditures 
we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million in of such amount  we plan to invest approximately million to acquire customer accounts and million for fixed assets 
capital expenditures for and are expected to be approximately million and million  respectively 
of these amounts approximately and million would be to acquire accounts with the balance for fixed assets 
these estimates are prepared for planning purposes and are revised from time to time 
actual expenditures for these and possibly other items not presently anticipated may vary from these estimates during the course of the years presented 
we believe that these capital requirements will be met in through the use of internally generated funds and drawings under our senior credit facility 
in subsequent years  we anticipate that these capital requirements will be met through the use of internally generated funds and external financings 
see risk factors we will need to refinance our senior credit facility 
subsequent events increase in senior credit facility 
in the first quarter of  pursuant to the terms of our senior credit facility  we requested and westar industries approved a million increase in the commitment under the facility 
retirement of additional debt 
in the first quarter of  we purchased from westar industries million face value of our bonds for million 
as a result of this transaction  an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax will be recognized in the first quarter of the debt securities purchased are shown below security carrying amount transaction price paid in capital gain loss in thousands senior subordinated discount notes   convertible senior subordinated notes   senior unsecured notes    senior subordinated notes    tax expense  extraordinary gain  net of tax  adjustments to paid in capital represent the difference in fair value of the bonds from the date westar industries made the open market purchases to the date we acquired them 
additionally  through march   we purchased million face value of senior subordinated notes in the open market for million which will result in an extraordinary gain of million in the first quarter of share repurchases 
from january  through march   we purchased  shares of our common stock for million of which  shares were purchased from westar industries for million 
the purchases from westar industries maintained its proportionate ownership of our outstanding common stock 
these shares are held as treasury stock

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in the market price  foreign currency exchange rates  equity instrument investment prices  as well as interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rates 
during  we acquired canadian operations with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as of december   the unrealized loss on currency translation  presented as a separate component of stockholders equity and reported within other comprehensive income was approximately million net of tax 
a change in the currency exchange rates would have an immaterial effect on other comprehensive loss 
interest rate exposure 
we have approximately million of long term variable rate debt as of december  a basis point change in the debt benchmark rate would impact net income by approximately million
