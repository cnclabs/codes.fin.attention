liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through a combination of cash from operations  private financings  an initial public offering of our common stock and cash obtained from our acquisition of erisco 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  including million in restricted cash 
in october  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  including  shares in connection with the exercise of underwriters over allotment option  at a price of per share  that raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
in addition  in connection with the offering   shares of common stock were sold by a selling stockholder at per share  for which we received no proceeds 
upon the closing of the offering  all of our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into approximately  shares of common stock 
cash used in operating activities in was million 
cash used during this period was primarily attributable to net losses of million  which was offset in part by depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  amortization of deferred stock compensation  write off of in process technology and other changes in operating assets and liability accounts 
these losses were principally related to increased research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the losses were generated by the expansion of our infrastructure to support growing demand of our recurring line of business 
the cash provided by investing activities of million in was primarily the result of million cash received in connection with the acquisition of erisco and net sales of million in short term and long term equity investments 
this increase was partially offset by our purchase of million in property and equipment and software licenses and million of payments related to our acquisitions of hme  erisco and rims 
the cash provided by financing activities of million in was primarily the result of million of proceeds from our line of credit and notes payable  million of proceeds from our equipment line of credit  and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee exercise of stock options and employee purchases of common stock 
the increase in cash from these proceeds was reduced by payments we made on the line of credit as well as principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations of million 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million which was amended in the fourth quarter to include erisco and rims as additional borrowers 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by all of our receivables and expires in september borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to and shall not exceed of qualified accounts as defined in the loan documents 
interest on the revolving credit facility is prime rate plus 
interest is payable monthly in arrears on the first business day of the month 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants  including minimum tangible net worth as defined  the generation of specified monthly net earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization  and minimum cash balances 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility of million 
in december  we entered into a lease line of credit with a financial institution 
this lease line of credit was specifically established to finance computer equipment purchases 
the lease line of credit had a limit of million and expired as scheduled in december borrowings under the lease line of credit at december  totaled approximately million  and are secured by the assets under lease 
in accordance with the terms of the lease line of credit  the outstanding balance is being repaid in monthly installments of principal and interest through june in march  we entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution 
in october  we entered into a subsequent agreement which increased the amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit has a total capacity of million and expires in december borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at prime plus and are collateralized by compensating cash balances on deposit 
interest is payable monthly as it accrues 
the line of credit agreement contains covenants that we must adhere to during the term of the agreement including restrictions on the payment of dividends 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
we have outstanding seven standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million which serve as security deposits for our capital leases 
we are required to maintain a cash balance equal to the outstanding letters of credit  which is classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
based on the our current operating plan  we believe existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances  cash forecasted by management to be generated by operations and borrowings from existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if events or circumstances occur such that the we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we may seek additional financing  which may include debt and or equity financing or funding through third party agreements 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas as amended by sfas and establishes methods of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for all quarters for all years beginning after june  it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the implementation of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in united states interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
the interest rate on our million revolving credit facility is prime plus 
the revolving credit facility expires in september as of december   we had outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit of million 
changes in interest rates have no impact on our other debt as all of our other notes have fixed interest rates between and 
we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and short term investments bearing variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
as a result  we do not believe that near term changes in interest rates will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows
