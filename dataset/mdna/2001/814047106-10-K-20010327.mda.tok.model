to analyze prospective loans  management assesses the company s objectives for both credit quality and interest rate pricing to determine whether to extend a loan and the appropriate rate of interest for each loan 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in various commercial  real estate and consumer loans to individuals and entities located in middle georgia 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of the loans is largely dependent upon economic conditions in the middle georgia area 
the local economy is generally stable

these securities provide snb with a source of liquidity and a stable source of income 
the investment portfolio provides a resource to help balance interest rate risk and credit risk related to the loan portfolio 
as of december   the securities portfolio totaled million  or percent of total assets  compared to million  or percent of assets at december  over recent years  the shrinkage in the size of the securities portfolio relative to total assets indicates that a higher proportion of earning assets have been deployed into the loan portfolio rather than in investment securities to produce greater yields 
the average tax equivalent yield on the portfolio  excluding the impact of sfas no 
market value adjustments for unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  was percent for the year versus percent in and percent in during the year  the investment securities portfolio  excluding unrealized gains and losses  represented percent of average earning assets and percent of average total assets 
during  the portfolio averaged percent of earning assets and percent of total assets 
this decrease is attributable to increased mortgage and commercial loan activity from the fairfield merger and general growth in overall earning assets at the two subsidiary banks

balances in nonearning assets are comprised of cash and correspondent bank balances  premises and equipment  foreclosed real estate  income receivable on loans and investments and other miscellaneous assets 
management works to minimize nonearning asset balances in order to maximize profit potential 
nonearning assets represented percent of the balance sheet as of december   and percent as of december  deposits deposits are snb s primary liability and funding source 
total deposits as of december  were million  up percent from million at december  average deposits in were million  up percent from million during the average cost of deposits  with noninterest checking accounts factored in  was percent during  up from percent during and percent in the increases are attributed to increases in rates paid on money market accounts and certificates of deposit to keep up with market competition and to attract additional funding for use in the new mortgage unit

snb holds no foreign deposits and has only minor balances of brokered deposits 
table maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more in thousands december as of the end of period months or less over months through months over months through months over months borrowed money other interest bearing sources of funds at december  totaled million 
the major component was million in various advance agreements from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb under the fixed and principal reducing credit programs 
interest rates on the fhlb notes range from percent to percent 
approximately million  or percent of the fhlb notes  matures in  million  or percent  matures in  and million  or percent  matures in under a blanket agreement and security agreement with the fhlb  residential first mortgage loans and investment securities are pledged as collateral for the fhlb advances outstanding 
outstanding advances from the fhlb averaged million during the year  with an average interest cost of percent 
for the year  fhlb advances averaged million with an average interest cost of percent 
fhlb borrowings have been used more extensively during to supplement traditional deposit sources and provide an additional funding source for higher activity levels in mortgage lending 
demand notes to the u 
s 
treasury of million at december  represented accumulated federal tax deposit payments through the treasury department s note option program 
these treasury deposit balances averaged million during  with an average interest cost of percent 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million at december   and a capital lease obligation totaled million 
reliance on other borrowed money as a funding source increased on average from million during to million during due to an increase in the use of fhlb notes to match against the company s growing mortgage volumes 
the cost of all nondeposit borrowed money components averaged percent in  up from percent in other interest bearing sources of funds at december  totaled million  up from million at december  of the year end balance  million consisted of fhlb notes  million was in treasury  tax and loan note balances  million was in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and million was in capital lease obligations 
part ii continued item continued other liabilities other liabilities of million at december  and million at december  consist of interest payable on deposits and borrowed funds  federal income taxes payable and other accrued but unpaid expenses 
liquidity snb  primarily through the actions of its subsidiary banks  engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals and credit commitments 
needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income  and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits or the renewal of maturing deposits 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits as needed 
through various asset liability management strategies  a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
balances held in cash and correspondent banks are reviewed daily to maximize the federal funds investment position 
internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the banks 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash without loss if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   snb held million in bonds  at amortized or accreted cost  in the available for sale portfolio  and million of these bonds mature  or are callable  within a one year period 
at december   the available for sale portfolio totaled million  with million maturing or callable within one year 
only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased 
the banks from time to time invest in short term cds at other banks  and generally maintain a net sold position in overnight federal funds 
management continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it relates to snb s liquidity posture 
snb had ratios of loans to deposits of percent as of december  and percent at december  the purchase of the fairfield mortgage company has increased management s emphasis on maintaining adequate resources for liquidity 
management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands 
the ratio of loans to all funding sources at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as the company s primary funding source 
the stability of the banks core deposit base is an important factor in the snb s liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
part ii continued item continued at december  and  the banks had million and million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
although these deposits represented percent and percent of respective total deposits  the majority of these large cds are stable deposits of local individuals and small businesses 
management works to avoid reliance on volatile deposits that might lead to liquidity pressures 
the parent company has an unsecured line of credit and the banks have established borrowing lines for federal funds through correspondent banks 
borrowing capacity also exists through the membership of the banks in the federal home loan bank program  and both banks have established access to national cd markets for deposit gathering through a bulletin board service if needed 
management believes that the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
capital resources and dividends snb has always placed emphasis on maintaining a strong capital base and continues to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements 
snb s equity capital of million at december  totals percent of total assets  compared to percent at december   and percent at december  on average  the equity capital was percent of assets during  compared to percent for and percent for the downward trend in the capital ratio reflects the company s strong balance sheet growth pattern  which has been most pronounced during the year information discussed below has been adjusted for stock splits 
in july   new shares of snb stock were issued in connection with the purchase acquisition of fairfield financial services  inc  producing million in additional capital 
in august   new shares of the company s common stock were issued for the pooling of interests stock swap merger with crossroads bancshares  inc additionally  marked the expiration of the outstanding stock warrants held by the company s organizing directors and executive officers 
during and  the holders completed the exercise of  warrants  generating a total of million in new capital 
there are no remaining founders warrants outstanding 
capital levels in and reflect an influx of million in proceeds from the issuance of new stock in two different events 
in september  snb issued a stock offering for the sale of  new shares of the company s common stock 
the issue  which generated million in new capital  was fully subscribed and successfully completed by february at the beginning of  snb issued an additional  shares of its common stock  primarily to newly elected directors and executive officers of the company 
this action produced million in new capital 
principal uses of the company s capital base in recent years have been a sustaining the capital adequacy of the banks as they continue to grow at a steady pace  b expanding the company s presence in macon and middle georgia with more physical locations and improved delivery systems  c expanding into contiguous houston county through the merger with sb houston and development of a mortgage loan division  d acquiring fairfield to broaden the company s mortgage services markets  and e enhancing corporate infrastructure support systems to manage snb s multi bank environment 
additional acquisitions may occur in the future 
part ii continued item continued regulators use a risk adjusted calculation to aid them in their determination of capital adequacy by weighting assets based on the degree of risk associated with on and off balance sheet assets 
the majority of these risk weighted assets for the company are on balance sheet assets in the form of loans 
small portions of risk weighted assets are considered off balance sheet assets comprised of letters of credit and loan commitments 
capital is categorized as either core tier capital or supplementary tier capital 
tier capital consists primarily of stockholders equity minus any intangible assets  while tier capital can consist of the reserve for loan losses up to certain limits  certain short term and other preferred stock and certain debt instruments 
current regulatory standards require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of percent  with at least percent of the capital consisting of tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent 
additionally  the regulatory agencies define a well capitalized bank as one that has a tier leverage ratio of at least percent  a tier capital ratio of at least percent  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent 
as of december   snb had a tier leverage ratio of percent  a tier capital ratio of percent  and a total risk based capital ratio of percent 
the company s total risk based capital ratio had fallen slightly below the well capitalized status at year end due to continuing strong growth trends in the balance sheet  management is currently assessing strategies to assure future capital adequacy 
the following table demonstrates capital ratio calculations as of december  and table capital ratios in thousands december as of end of period tier capital stockholders equity less intangible assets total tier capital tier capital eligible portion of reserve for loan losses subordinated and other qualifying debt total tier capital total risk based capital total net risk weighted assets regulatory requirement well minimum capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier capital ratio leverage ratio part ii continued item continued cash dividends of  or 
per weighted average common share  were declared and paid during  up from  or 
per share during  and  or 
per share in the ratios of cash dividends paid to net income for these years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
since the commencement of cash dividend payments in  the snb board of directors has consistently declared and paid dividends on a quarterly basis 
on june   a percent stock split was issued and effected in the form of a dividend  and on september   a percent stock split was issued and effected in the form of a dividend 
per share data for all periods presented have been retroactively restated to reflect the additional shares resulting from these stock splits 
management is not aware of any trends  events  or uncertainties that will have  or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on snb s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
further  management is aware of no current recommendations by regulatory authorities that  if they were to be implemented  would have such an effect 
acquisition on january   snb entered into an agreement and plan of merger with crossroads bancshares  inc in perry  georgia  pursuant to which crossroads would be merged with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of snb 
on august   the merger was completed in a percent stock pooling of interests transaction  and  shares of snb common stock were issued to effect the merger 
on june   the bank name was changed from crossroads bank to security bank of houston county 
sb houston operates four offices in houston county one in perry  georgia and three in warner robins  georgia 
the merger allowed snb to establish an immediate presence in its primary targeted market for expansion 
houston county is included in the same macon warner robins metropolitan statistical area as snb s principal bibb county market 
the warner robins air force base is the largest employer in the middle georgia area and helps to make the two counties a common market 
on july   sb bibb acquired fairfield financial services  inc fairfield  a well established mortgage loan company based in macon  georgia 
the purchase transaction involved a combination of snb stock and cash consideration 
fairfield has ten georgia locations  including offices in macon  columbus  warner robins  savannah  richmond hill  rincon  fayetteville and st 
simons island 
the company now functions as a subsidiary of sb bibb 
the company s percent growth rate in total assets from december  to december  is largely attributed to a the success of these two acquisitions in developing synergies and market cohesiveness in middle georgia  and b the community banking philosophies of the two subsidiary banks during a period of merger shake ups in the local markets 
part ii continued item continued expanded coverage of market area bibb county as the company grows  it continues to add physical office locations and delivery channels to serve its existing middle georgia market 
due to continuing growth trends  sb bibb has outgrown its current executive offices in macon and expects to build a new corporate center and banking office by mid additional space is also needed for operations and data processing functions  and the company expects to lease a larger facility by late snb is adequately capitalized to meet all anticipated capital expenditure needs 
during  the company introduced an internet banking product for its customers 
in  the hartley bridge road branch was constructed and opened in southwest bibb county by the lead bank 
this is sb bibb s sixth full service location in macon 
sb bibb purchased an existing facility and opened its fifth full service office at pio nono avenue in south macon in august sb bibb s existing shurling drive branch was relocated in to a larger and more convenient major intersection at shurling drive 
in february  the bank relocated its in house data processing facility and operational functions to a leased operations center on riverside drive near the bank s main office 
platformation and other improvements to the company s internal information technology were made in during  a remote atm night depository facility was established on forsyth road in northwest macon 
these additional fixed asset purchases were financed through the equity base and retained earnings of the company with no external borrowing 
houston county during the first quarter of  sb houston s fourth full service office in houston county was established on houston lake road in warner robins 
the mortgage division in houston county has now been merged into the fairfield administration and relocated from leased space into the new branch office on houston lake road 
mortgage division the acquisition of fairfield during brings ten georgia mortgage offices to sb bibb 
these offices  located in macon  columbus  warner robins  savannah  richmond hill  rincon  fayetteville  and st 
simons island  are well established and provide only mortgage services at this time 
snb management may consider converting one or more of the fairfield offices into full service banking offices in the future 
alternatively  management may consider additional expansion moves into the markets where fairfield offices are now located 
part ii continued item continued results of operations for the years ended december   and information for all prior periods in the following discussion has been retroactively adjusted for the pooling of interests combination with crossroads bancshares  inc  which occurred on august  snb s net income was   and  for the years  and  respectively

during   in one time pre tax expense was incurred for the acquisition in houston county and associated name changes for the banks 
additional overhead costs have been incurred for the periods shown for the establishment of a more extensive branch network and increased technological costs associated with setting up a multi bank data processing center 
net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and liabilities is the principal source of earnings for the company 
snb s average net interest rate margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  was percent in  percent in and percent in although the margin yield has exhibited a trend of decline  the company has been able to maintain reasonable margins per industry standards 
net interest income before tax equivalency adjustments in totaled  up percent from  in the net interest income was up percent from  posted in the following table presents interest income  adjusted to a tax equivalent basis  interest expense and the resulting average net interest rate margins for the past three years

compared to tax equivalent net interest income increased by  from to this increase in absolute dollars of margin in was driven by strong balance sheet growth 
the average margin yield declined by basis points  from percent in to percent in over the course of  the prime borrowing rate increased by basis points  from percent to percent by year end 
management was able to improve average loan yields by basis points in spite of intense local competition on loan pricing 
yields on the investment portfolio were also improved by basis points through repricing and purchases at current market rates 
the margin was also aided by a shift in balance sheet mix from the bond portfolio to the loan portfolio as the year proceeded 
however  the margin was negatively impacted by an increase in the overall cost of funds of basis points for the year 
management resorted to higher balances in more costly borrowed funds to support strong loan growth  and deposits repriced rapidly at higher market rates during the year 
balances in average interest earning assets rose by percent in over growth in higher yielding loan balances accounted for most of this increase 
average loan balances increased percent and represented percent of the average balance sheet in  up from percent of the average balance sheet in investment securities  on the other hand  declined from percent to percent of the average balance sheet 
the overall yield on average interest earning assets  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased by basis points from percent in to percent in at the same time  the overall average cost of interest bearing liabilities has increased by basis points  from percent in to percent in most deposit rates increased in over  due to increases in general market rates and strong competition for deposits 
average deposit balances also grew  increasing percent in over this growth is attributed to aggressive marketing in a period of flux for area super regional competition  growing consumer business due to the convenience of a larger branch network  increases in business deposit relationships from larger commercial credit lines  and fairfield cross selling synergies 
with the increased liquidity needs brought on by strong loan demand and the increased mortgage activity  average balances in other borrowing sources increased from million in to million in rates paid on these borrowings increased as well  from percent in to percent in compared to tax equivalent net interest income increased by  from to the increase is attributed to significant balance sheet growth and improvements in balance sheet mix 
the average margin yield declined by basis points  from percent in to percent in yields on average earnings assets declined by basis points  from percent in to percent in average interest earning asset balances increased by percent in over loans became a more dominant asset  representing percent of the average balance sheet in  up from percent in lower yielding investment securities and federal funds sold dropped to percent of average assets  down from percent during rates paid on deposits and other funding sources trended downward over the periods due to the declining rate environment at that time

b reflects taxable equivalent adjustments using the statutory federal income tax rate of percent in adjusting interest on tax exempt investment securities to a fully taxable basis 
part ii continued item continued interest rate risk management the management of interest rate risk is the primary goal of snb s asset liability management function 
snb attempts to achieve consistent growth in net interest income while limiting volatility from changes in interest rates 
management seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities 
snb s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect on net interest income of interest rate moves in either direction is not expected to be significant over time 
the principal tool used by snb to measure its interest rate sensitivity is a cumulative gap analysis model that seeks to measure the repricing differentials  or gap  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time horizons 
additionally  simulation modeling is used to estimate the impact on net interest income of overall repricing at various levels of increase or decrease in current market interest rates over a range of plus or minus basis points 
at december   the company estimates through simulation modeling that net interest income at its lead bank in bibb county would increase by  if interest rates increased by basis points  and decrease by if interest rates declined by basis points 
the following table reflects the gap positions of snb s consolidated balance sheet as of december  and at various repricing intervals 
this gap analysis indicates that snb s repricing abilities showed liability sensitive over a one year time horizon at december  and december   with negative cumulative one year gaps of percent at year end and percent at year end 
the projected deposit repricing volumes reflect adjustments based on management s assumptions of the expected rate sensitivity to current market rates for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts 
adjustments are also made for callable investment securities in the bond portfolio to place these bonds in call date categories

the reserve for loan losses on december  stood at percent of outstanding net loans  compared to percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be transferred to the reserve for loan losses to maintain a level that it considers adequate in relation to the risk of future losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
it is the policy of snb s subsidiary banks to provide for exposure to losses principally through an ongoing loan review process 
this review process is undertaken to ascertain any probable losses that must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of individually significant loans and of the portfolio in the aggregate 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers and the loan committees of the banks boards of directors  and also those of the regulatory agencies that review the loans as part of their regular examination process 
during routine examinations of banks  the primary banking regulators may  from time to time  require additions to banks provisions for loan losses and reserves for loan losses if the regulators credit evaluations differ from those of management 
part ii continued item continued in addition to ongoing internal loan reviews and risk assessment  management uses other factors to judge the adequacy of the reserve including current economic conditions  loan loss experience  regulatory guidelines and current levels of nonperforming loans 
management believes that the  balance in the reserve for loan losses at december   and the  balance at december  were adequate to absorb known risks in the loan portfolio at those dates 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the company s loan portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan becomes impaired  management calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded  through a charge to earnings  as an adjustment to the reserve for loan losses 
when management considers a loan  or a portion thereof  as uncollectible  it is charged against the reserve for loan losses

the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur

asset quality nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans restructured due to debtors financial difficulties  loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and still accruing  and real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossession 
nonaccrual loans are those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
restructured loans generally allow for an extension of the original repayment period or a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
loans  whether secured or unsecured  are generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal and or interest is days or more past due  or sooner if it is known or expected that the collection of all principal and or interest is unlikely 
any loan past due days or more  if not classified as nonaccrual based on a determination of collectibility  is classified as a past due loan 
other real estate is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated market value at the date of acquisition 
a provision for estimated losses is recorded when a subsequent decline in value occurs 
nonperforming assets at december  totaled  or percent of total assets 
this compares to  in nonperforming assets at december   which represented percent of total assets 
nonperforming assets at december  were  or percent of total assets 
the reserve for loan losses has been maintained over time at levels that are more than sufficient to absorb the total amount of nonperforming assets

at december  and december   there were no other loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss or doubtful which are not included in the table above  but there were other loans classified for regulatory purposes as substandard or special mention which are not included in the table above 
however  management is aware of no such substandard or special mention loans not included above which i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which any information causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
part ii continued item continued noninterest income noninterest income of  in represented a percent increase  or  from  recorded in the major contributor to improved noninterest income was the increase in fees from mortgage lending activities 
the acquisition of fairfield at the end of july produced five months of fee volume on loans made and sold in secondary markets 
total mortgage fees for the year totaled  up by  from  in fees collected during service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or percent  between the two periods 
the increase was due to growth in core transaction accounts 
other increases were recorded in volume driven income sources such as atm fees 
noninterest income in totaled  up percent from  in approximately percent of the increase  or  is attributed to fees from the mortgage division that was established late in other increases were realized in service charges on deposit accounts due to the strong growth in core deposits and increased fees collected for insufficient funds 
noninterest expense noninterest expense was  for the year  up percent from  in the banks continue to increase staff to strengthen the management team  take advantage of local market shake ups  and add internal support positions 
the addition of the ten new mortgage offices significantly increased commission based compensation expense 
total salaries and benefits increased by  or percent 
occupancy costs grew by percent  or  the increase is attributed to operating  rental and depreciation costs for the ten new mortgage offices  plus general increases in equipment and maintenance costs 
all other operating overhead increased by  or percent  due to overhead expenses associated with the new fairfield offices and to volume driven increases from high balance sheet growth rates 
noninterest expense was  for the year  up percent from  in over half of the increase is attributed to higher costs of salaries and benefits for a growing organization with added physical locations 
salaries and benefits increased by  or percent  and occupancy costs increased by  or percent 
other overhead expense decreased by  or percent  as costs relating to the sb houston merger and data processing conversions were fully absorbed by income tax expense snb s consolidated federal and state income tax expense increased to  in  up from  in  and  in the effective tax rate was percent  percent  and percent in   and  respectively 
the company s effective rates tend to hover just under maximum corporate tax rates due to the relatively small percentage of tax free investments carried on the balance sheet 
see note to snb s consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of income taxes 
part ii continued item continued inflation inflation impacts the financial condition and operating results of snb 
however  because most of the assets of the bank subsidiaries are monetary in nature  the effect is less significant compared to other commercial or industrial companies with heavy investments in inventories and fixed assets 
inflation influences the growth of total banking assets  which in turn produces a need for an increased equity capital base to support the growing banks 
inflation also influences interest rates and tends to raise the general level of salaries  operating costs and purchased services 
the mortgage division is particularly impacted by swings in the interest rate cycle 
snb has not attempted to measure the effect of inflation on various types of income and expense due to difficulties in quantifying the impact 
management s awareness of inflationary effects has led to various operational strategies to cope with its impact 
the banks engage in various asset liability management strategies to control interest rate sensitivity and minimize exposure to interest rate risk 
prices for banking products and services are continually reviewed in relation to current costs  and overhead cost cutting is an ongoing task
