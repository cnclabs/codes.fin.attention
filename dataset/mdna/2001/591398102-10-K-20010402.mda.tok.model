the following risk factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
product concentration  demand for products revenues from cd rom manufacturing sales constituted substantially all of the company s revenues for although the company is implementing a plan to increase revenues from its fulfillment packaging and distribution services  cd rom manufacturing sales are expected to continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company experienced a material decrease in revenues in its cd rom manufacturing sales in this decrease was the caused  in part  by a decline in the demand for the company s cd rom products and services  which decline in demand was caused primarily by i the continuation of customers to increase their use of electronic methods to distribute information rather than cd rom  and ii the continuation of the maturity of the market for cd rom products 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to impact the demand for the company s cd rom products and services in  which may cause a further decline in cd rom manufacturing sales in the continued decrease in demand for the company s products and services would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
included in the company s cd rom products and services are audio cds for the radio syndication programming services market 
radio syndication sales significantly declined in and due to customers choosing to use cd recordable as a distribution method for smaller size orders  a trend that the company believes will continue for the foreseeable future 
due to this change in the distribution method  along with the maturity of the radio syndication programming services market and the company s existing share of sales in that market  the company believes that revenues from radio syndication sales will continue to decline for the foreseeable future 
pricing in  the pricing for cd rom products and services continued to decline industry wide due to excess manufacturing capacity  a trend the company anticipates will continue into in prior years  market growth offset increased manufacturing capacity in the cd rom industry 
however  this growth is not anticipated to continue due to the continued maturation of this market 
in addition  the company s pricing of its new products and services may not in all cases be competitive with the other providers in the marketplace  and some new products and services may not be profitable 
risks related to intangible assets a portion of the company s consolidated total assets are represented by intangible assets 
in the event of any sale or liquidation of the company or a portion of its assets  there can be no assurance that the value of the company s intangible assets will be realized 
in addition  the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred indicating that any portion of the remaining balance of the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that the amount allocable to the company s intangible assets has been impaired  the company would be required to write down the carrying value of such assets 
in  based on this evaluation  management determined that it was necessary to write down approximately million of intangible assets associated with its silicon valley facility 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any future determination requiring the write down of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
competition the company faces competition in the information distribution industry from a number of sources  such as traditional print publishers  on line distributors of information  cd rom manufacturers  and others 
the company s competitors vary by market segment and include many companies which are larger  more established  and have substantially more resources than the company 
the company does not benefit from patents or proprietary technology  and competition may increase in the future 
technological change the market for information distribution services incorporating optical disc technology is based upon a sophisticated technology and is subject to rapid technological change 
current or new competitors may introduce new products  features or services that could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
additionally  there can be no assurance that over time optical disc technology will not be replaced by another form of information storage and retrieval technology  such as electronic information services 
the company must continue to improve its products and related services and develop and successfully market new products and services in order to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel  particularly jeffrey m 
wilkins  its chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
wilkins services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company
