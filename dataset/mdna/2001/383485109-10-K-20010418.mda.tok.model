liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the company s working capital requirements were met through a combination of borrowings under its revolving line of credit  short term trade credit  and by sales of proprietary credit card accounts under its receivables securitization program 
working capital increased by approximately million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the company s ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to as of the end of fiscal as compared to as of the end of fiscal as described more fully below  the company acquired stores from lamonts in fiscal and capital requirements  costs associated with opening the stores and lower than expected operating results generated by those stores reduced the company s liquidity position as of the end of fiscal acquisition of stores from lamonts 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  on july   the company acquired former lamonts store leases  related store fixtures and equipment  and one store building for a net purchase price of million in cash 
the acquisition significantly expanded the company s presence in the pacific northwest and alaska 
a portion of the purchase price for the assets was financed through the issuance of a million three year note payable to a third party lender 
the company financed the remainder of the purchase price from existing financial resources 
the company incurred approximately million of non recurring costs in connection with the re opening of the former lamonts stores 
the company also experienced a significant outflow of cash to purchase an adequate level of merchandise to open the stores  to refurbish the stores and to integrate the stores into the company s existing information systems 
in addition to the cash required to acquire and open the stores  operating results produced by those stores for their first five months of operation were lower than expected 
these factors contributed to the million operating cash flow deficit in fiscal management believes that the cash required to operate and maintain an optimal level of merchandise in the acquired stores in fiscal will be significantly less than that required to initially open those stores in fiscal management has also implemented various initiatives aimed at improving sales  profitability and cash flows generated by those stores 
such initiatives include  but are not limited to  revising the merchandise mix in the stores based on current selling trends  improving the effectiveness of advertising expenditures  improving sales associate productivity  and reducing staffing levels and other operating costs  where appropriate 
in addition  the company is evaluating the possible sale or closure of five to seven of the stores which are currently considered to be either underperforming  or inconsistent with the long term operating strategy of the company  due to their small size  low sales volume and or location 
the company is also evaluating the possible mortgage financing of the building acquired in the lamonts transaction 
although management believes that these initiatives will improve the company s liquidity position in fiscal  there can be no assurance that the company will integrate the lamonts stores into its operations successfully and improve their profitability 
sources of liquidity 
revolving line of credit 
the company has a million revolving line of credit facility with congress financial corporation western through march  borrowings under the arrangement are limited to a restrictive borrowing base that is generally equal to of eligible merchandise inventories  and at the company s option  such borrowings may be increased to of such inventories during the period of november through december of each year  to fund increased seasonal inventory requirements 
during the period of march  through february   interest on outstanding borrowings was charged at a rate of libor plus at february   with no interest charged on the unused portion of the line of credit 
the interest rate was increased to libor plus on march  the company had million of excess availability under the credit facility as of february   and was in compliance with the single financial loan covenant applicable to the facility 
receivables securitization program 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sells all of its accounts receivable arising under its private label credit cards on an ongoing basis under a receivables securitization facility 
the facility provides the company with an additional source of working capital and long term financing that is generally more cost effective than traditional debt financing 
on march   the company issued a million principal amount fixed base class a credit card certificate the series to a single investor through a private placement 
proceeds from the issuance of the series were used to repay the outstanding balances of previously issued certificates  totaling million as of that date  and the remaining funds were used to purchase additional receivables from the company 
the holder of the series certificate earns interest on a monthly basis at a fixed interest rate of  and the outstanding principal balance of the certificate  which is off balance sheet for financial reporting purposes  is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments commencing september and continuing through august on november   a variable base class a credit card certificate the series was also issued in the principal amount of up to million 
the series was issued to provide financing for receivables in the company s portfolio in excess of amounts required to support the series  and for the additional receivables expected to be generated by the new stores opened in the second half of fiscal the company can borrow against the series certificate on a revolving basis  similar to a revolving line of credit arrangement 
such borrowings are limited to a specified percentage of the outstanding balance of receivables underlying the certificate 
the holder of the series certificate earns interest on a monthly basis at a variable rate equal to one month libor plus at february  
as of february   million was issued and outstanding against the certificate  which was the maximum amount available for borrowings as of that date 
the series certificate was issued for an initial day commitment period expiring october   and may be extended for subsequent day periods at the option of gcc trust and the certificate holder  through july  the outstanding principal balance of the certificate  which is treated as off balance sheet for financial reporting purposes  is to be repaid in six equal monthly installments commencing in the month following the end of the commitment period 
in the event the commitment period is extended through july   the principal is to be repaid in twelve equal monthly installments commencing september and continuing through august management presently expects to reissue the certificate for an additional day period upon its expiration on october  monthly cash flows generated by the company s credit card portfolio  consisting of principal and interest collections  are first used to pay certain costs of the program  which include the payment of principal when required and interest to the investor  and monthly servicing fees to the company 
any excess cash flows are then available to fund additional purchases of newly generated receivables  ultimately serving as a source of working capital financing for the company 
subject to certain conditions  the company may expand the securitization program to meet future receivables growth 
uses of liquidity 
capital expenditures in fiscal  totaling million  were primarily related to tenant improvements and fixtures and equipment for the new department stores opened during the year  the renovation and refixturing of certain existing locations  and for various information systems enhancements  including those required to integrate the newly acquired stores into the company s existing systems 
the company presently has no commitments to open or remodel any stores in fiscal management has the ability to limit or delay a significant percentage of its current fiscal planned capital expenditures without adversely affecting the company s business  its financial condition or its results of operations 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has other long term obligations  including capital lease obligations  with total outstanding balances of million at february  million as of january  
the obligations mature at dates ranging from to  bear interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to  and are collateralized by various properties and equipment of the company 
the scheduled annual principal maturities on the company s various long term obligations are million  million  million   and  for fiscal through  with million due thereafter 
in addition  in fiscal the company issued a million subordinated note in connection with the harris acquisition 
the subordinated note is due august   but may be extended to august under certain circumstances 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s long term debt and lease arrangements contain various restrictive financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such restrictive financial covenants as of february  management believes the previously described sources of liquidity  including  without limitation  the anticipated proceeds from the proposed sale or mortgage financing of certain of the stores acquired in the lamonts transaction  will be adequate to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for fiscal inflation although inflation has not been a material factor in the company s operations during the past several years  the company has experienced increases in the costs of certain of its merchandise  salaries  employee benefits and other general and administrative costs  including health care and workers compensation costs 
the company is generally able to offset these increases by adjusting its selling prices or by modifying its operations 
the company s ability to adjust selling prices is limited by competitive pressures in its market areas 
the company accounts for its merchandise inventories on the retail method using last in  first out lifo cost based upon the department store price indices published by the bureau of labor statistics 
under this method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current costs and thus reduces the impact of inflation due to increasing costs on reported income 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of net sales  gross profit and operating results realized during the christmas selling months of november and december of each year  and to a lesser extent  during the easter and back to school selling seasons 
the company s results may also vary from quarter to quarter as a result of  among other things  the timing and level of the company s sales promotions  weather  fashion trends and the overall health of the economy  both nationally and in the company s market areas 
working capital requirements also fluctuate during the year  increasing substantially prior to the christmas selling season when the company must carry significantly higher inventory levels 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly results of operations for fiscal and in thousands  except per share data

the total of such costs recognized in fiscal amounted to  income loss before income tax expense benefit in the three month period ended january  includes a non recurring  pre tax charge for  to reflect the impairment of an investment accounted for under the cost method 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
 as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the company will adopt sfas no 
effective as of the beginning of fiscal management does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  was issued in september and replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after march   with certain disclosure requirements effective for fiscal years ending after december  fiscal for the company 
the statement carries over most of the provisions of sfas no 
without reconsideration and  accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to materially affect the company s financial position or the results of its operations 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for its fiscal financial statements 
effective as of the end of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  which requires that all amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction for shipping and handling  including customer delivery charges  be classified as revenue  and that all prior periods presented be reclassified to conform with the required presentation 
the company had previously included shipping and handling revenues and costs in its selling  general and administrative costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business due to changes in interest rates on short term borrowings under its revolving line of credit  the series certificate and on one of its long term borrowing arrangements 
as of february   borrowings subject to a variable interest rate represented of the company s total outstanding borrowings both on and off balance sheet 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for speculative or trading purposes  nor does the company purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit  series certificate and one of its long term borrowing arrangements  are based on variable interest rates and are therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase of basis points on existing floating rate borrowings a change from the company s weighted average interest rate as of february  would reduce the company s pre tax net income and cash flow by approximately  this basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of the company s fixed rate financial instruments
