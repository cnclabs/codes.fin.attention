the distribution  which occurred on may   marked the beginning of triad s operations as an independent  publicly traded company 
as such  the historical financial statements prior to the distribution of triad may not be indicative of triad s future performance  nor do they necessarily reflect what the financial position and results of operations of triad would have been if it had operated as a separate  stand alone entity during the entire periods presented 
during  triad sold ten hospitals and two ambulatory surgery centers and opened one new hospital  which is accounted for using the equity method 
during  triad ceased operations of two hospitals  sold one hospital and purchased two hospitals

you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations revenue volume trends during the years ended december  and  triad experienced declines in revenue and volumes 
management believes the following factors have contributed to the declines in revenue during the years ended december  and 
the announced divestitures of hospitals in certain markets  
the disposition of ten acute care hospitals and two surgery centers during 
the transfer pursuant to a long term lease to an unaffiliated third party of two acute care hospitals and three ambulatory surgery centers  
the cessation of operations of two hospitals during  
the impact of reductions in medicare payments mandated by the balanced budget act  and 
the continuing trend toward the conversion of more services to an outpatient basis 
in the healthcare industry  operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations  including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in patient utilization during the cold weather months 
triad s revenues continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of revenue being derived from fixed payment  higher discount sources  including medicare  medicaid and managed care plans 
in addition  insurance companies  government programs  other than medicare  and employers purchasing health care services for their employees are also negotiating discounted amounts that they will pay health care providers rather than paying standard prices 
triad expects patient volumes from medicare and medicaid to continue to increase due to the general aging of the population and expansion of state medicaid programs 
however  under the balanced budget act  triad s reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs was reduced in and and will be further reduced as some reductions in reimbursement levels are phased in over the next year  although certain of the reductions will be reduced by the refinement act 
in december  congress passed bipa which will further offset reductions from the balanced budget act  which triad currently estimates to an additional million of reinbursement annually 
the balanced budget act has accelerated a shift  by certain medicare beneficiaries  from traditional medicare coverage to medical coverage that is provided under managed care plans 
triad generally receives lower payments per patient under managed care plans than under traditional indemnity insurance plans 
with an increasing proportion of services being reimbursed based upon fixed payment amounts  where the payment is based upon the diagnosis  regardless of the cost incurred or level of service provided  revenues  earnings and cash flows are being significantly reduced 
as part of the balanced budget act  hcfa implemented outpatient pps on august  which reduced reimbursement in slightly 
net patient revenues related to medicare and medicaid patients were and of total net patient revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net patient revenues related to managed care plan patients were and of total net patient revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net patient revenues from capitation arrangements  or prepaid health service agreements  are less than of net patient revenues in each period presented 
see item i business reimbursement 
as discussed previously  management of triad has focused on streamlining its portfolio of facilities to eliminate those with poor financial performance  weak competitive market positions or locations in certain urban markets 
during the year ended december   triad and hca sold ten hospitals and during the year ended december   triad sold one hospital and ceased operations of two hospitals 
net revenues for these facilities were million and million and losses before impairment charges  gain on sale  and income tax benefit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
triad s revenues also continue to be affected by the trend toward certain services being performed more frequently on an outpatient basis 
growth in outpatient services is expected to continue in the health care industry as procedures performed on an inpatient basis are converted to outpatient procedures through continuing advances in pharmaceutical and medical technologies 
the redirection of certain procedures to an outpatient basis is also influenced by pressures from payers to perform certain procedures as outpatient care rather than inpatient care 
net outpatient revenues for facilities that remain after sales and closures were in the year ended december  compared to in the comparable period in reductions in the rate of increase in medicare and medicaid reimbursement  increasing percentages of the patient volume being related to patients participating in managed care plans and continuing trends toward more services being performed on an outpatient basis are expected to present ongoing challenges 
the challenges presented by these trends are magnified by triad s inability to control these trends and the associated risks 
to maintain and improve its operating margins in future periods  triad must increase patient volumes while controlling the costs of providing services 
if triad is not able to achieve reductions in the cost of providing services through operational efficiencies  and the trend toward declining reimbursements and payments continues  results of operations and cash flows will deteriorate 
management believes that the proper response to these challenges includes the delivery of a broad range of quality health care services to physicians and patients with operating decisions being made by the local management teams and local physicians 
in connection with the distribution  hca agreed to indemnify triad for any payments which it is required to make in respect of medicare  medicaid and blue cross cost reports for former hca facilities owned by triad at the time of the spin off from hca relating to periods ending on or prior to the date of the distribution  and triad agreed to indemnify hca for and pay to hca any payments received by it relating to such cost reports relating to periods ending on or prior to the date of the distribution 
triad will be responsible for the filing of these cost reports and any terminating cost reports 
triad has recorded a receivable from hca relating to the indemnification of million as of december  operating results summary following are comparative summaries of results from continuing operations for the years ended december   and dollars are in millions  except per share amounts and ratios

ebitda is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry  and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability 
ebitda should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  and the items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
b this table does not include any operating statistics for facilities leased to others and  except for admissions  the joint ventures 
c ongoing operations exclude facilities that were sold or closed 
d licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency 
e available beds are those beds a facility actually has in use 
f represents the total number of patients admitted in the facility for a period in excess of hours to triad s facilities and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volume 
g adjusted admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
adjusted admissions are computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue 
the adjusted admissions computation adjusts outpatient revenue to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
h represents the average number of days an admitted patient stays in triad s hospitals 
average length of stay has declined due to the continuing pressures from managed care and other payers to restrict admissions and reduce the number of days that are covered by the payers for certain procedures  and by technological and pharmaceutical improvements 
years ended december  and income before income taxes increased to million in the year ended december  from a loss of million in the year ended december  the increase in pretax income was attributable to impairment charges of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  other factors contributing to the increase were decreased losses before impairment charges of million in the facilities that were divested and improvement in the operations of the facilities that comprise ongoing operations of million 
in addition  there were million of favorable prior year cost report settlements and contractual estimates during the year ended december  and million increases in equity in earnings  primarily due to one non consolidating entity which opened in may these increases were partially offset during the year ended december  by million of unfavorable contractual adjustments at one facility  million of unfavorable adjustments at one facility from write offs of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and other adjustments and million of unfavorable adjustments in equity in earnings at a non consolidating entity from various changes of estimates and other adjustments 
revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  compared to  million in the year ended december  revenues declined primarily as a result of the facilities that were sold or closed 
in the year ended december   these facilities had revenues of million compared to million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   revenues in the facilities that were sold or closed included million in favorable prior year cost report settlements and contractual estimates

salaries and benefits for ongoing operations decreased to as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  salaries and benefits decreased due to million from a favorable adjustment relating to triad s retirement plan contributions during the year ended december  and increases in labor productivity

salaries and benefits for ongoing operations included million from the acquisition of two facilities in the fourth quarter of supply costs remained constant as a percentage of revenues in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   supplies for the facilities sold or closed were million compared to million in the year ended december  supplies for ongoing operations increased as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was attributable to higher patient acuity  price increases and million from the acquisition of two facilities in the fourth quarter of additionally  an unfavorable adjustment of million was recorded at one facility from write offs of certain expenses that were previously capitalized during the year ended december  other operating expenses primarily consisting of contract services  professional fees  repairs and maintenance  rents and leases  utilities  insurance and non income taxes  decreased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  for the year ended december   other operating expenses for the facilities sold or closed were million compared to million in the year ended december  other operating expenses for ongoing operations decreased as a percentage of revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the increase in revenues

impairments on long lived assets were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impairments during were due primarily to the carrying value of the long lived assets related to one hospital closed being reduced to fair value  based on estimated disposal value 
the impairments during were due to reductions of the book value of certain facilities that triad divested during to fair value  based on estimates of selling values 
minority interests  which are primarily related to one joint venture in arizona that includes ambulatory surgery centers  as a percentage of revenues remained relatively unchanged in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  equity in earnings loss of affiliates was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to reduction in losses of million for one non consolidating entity which opened in may this was offset by million of unfavorable adjustments for various changes of estimates and other adjustments at one non consolidating entity during the year ended december  years ended december  and losses from continuing operations before income tax benefit decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in pretax loss was primarily attributable to gain on sales of ten hospitals in the year ended december  of million 
additional factors contributing to the decrease in pretax loss were million of lease income from the leased facilities  a million reduction in interest expense and corporate overhead compared to the allocation of interest expense and management fees from hca and million improvement in the operations of facilities that will remain after planned divestitures 
these were partially offset by an increase in impairment charges of million recorded in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  due to the management reassessment of the facilities that would not be part of triad s core markets 
additional offsetting factors included a reduction in the operations of million relating to the leased facilities in the kansas city  missouri area  a million reduction in the operations of the facilities which were sold during  million of favorable cost report settlements in and million reduction in equity in earnings of non consolidating entities due to the start up of operations of a hospital that opened in may revenues decreased to  million in the year ended december  compared to  million in the year ended december  inpatient admissions decreased and adjusted admissions  adjusted to reflect combined inpatient and outpatient volume  decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues  admissions and adjusted admissions declined primarily as a result of the facilities that were leased in january and the facilities that were sold during the leased facilities had revenues of million  admissions of  and adjusted admissions of  during year ended december  the ten hospitals sold had net revenues of million and million  admissions of  and  and adjusted admissions of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  million of favorable cost report settlements were received in these were partially offset by million of lease income from the leased facilities in the year ended december  and increases in net revenues of million  admissions of  and adjusted admissions of  in the facilities that will remain after divestitures 
revenues have been decreasing over the past several years due to several additional factors 
these factors include decreases in medicare rates of reimbursement mandated by the balanced budget act which became effective october   such rates lowered revenues by approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  and continued increases in discounts from the growing number of managed care payers  managed care as a percent of net revenues increased to compared to during the year ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  salaries and benefits per adjusted admissions decreased during compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the leased facilities  which had a higher percentage of salaries and benefits to net revenue 
supply costs decreased as a percentage of revenues to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  supply costs per adjusted admissions decreased during compared to this was primarily due to the leased facilities having a higher percentage of supply costs to net revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by the purchases of higher cost items due to higher acute care patients and increases in prices 
other operating expenses  primarily consisting of contract services  professional fees  repairs and maintenance  rents and leases  utilities  insurance and non income taxes  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  due primarily to a reduction in the use of outside contract vendors

given the breadth of the ongoing investigations  hca expects additional subpoenas and other investigative and prosecutorial activity to occur in these and other jurisdictions in the future 
hca is the subject of a formal order of investigation by the sec 
hca understands that the sec s investigation includes the anti fraud  insider trading  periodic reporting and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws

two of the three triad hospitals named as defendants terminated their relationship with curative health services prior to the distribution and the third hospital continues to maintain an ongoing relationship with curative health services 
additionally  in early approximately thirteen of triad s current and former hospitals received notices of reopening for cost reporting periods between and  which are prior to the distribution 
these notices indicate that reviews of the applicable cost reports will be conducted at hcfa s direction 
in july  olsten corporation and its subsidiary  kimberly home health neither of which is affiliated with hca  announced that they would pay million to settle allegations that both companies defrauded the medicare program 
kimberly pled guilty to three separate felony charges conspiracy  mail fraud and violating the medicare anti kickback statute filed by the us attorneys in the middle and southern districts of florida and the northern district of georgia 
while hca was not specifically named in these guilty pleas  the guilty pleas refer to the involvement of a company a or a company not named as a defendant 
hca has disclosed that it believes these references refer to hca or its subsidiaries 
hca is a defendant in a number of other suits  which allege  in general  improper and fraudulent billing  overcharging  coding and physician referrals  as well as other violations of law 
certain of the suits have been conditionally certified as class actions 
since april  numerous securities class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee against hca and a number of its current and former directors  officers and or employees 
several derivative actions have been filed in state court by certain purported stockholders of hca against certain of its current and former officers and directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty  and failure to take reasonable steps to ensure that hca did not engage in illegal practices thereby exposing it to significant damages 
on may   hca announced that it had reached an understanding with attorneys of the civil division of the department of justice to recommend an agreement to settle  subject to certain conditions  the civil claims actions against hca relating to diagnosis related group coding  outpatient laboratory billing and home health issues 
the understanding with the department of justice attorneys would require hca to pay million in compensation to the government  with interest accruing at a fixed rate of per annum beginning may   and would reduce hca s existing letter of credit agreement with the government from billion to million at the time of the payment of the settlement 
on december   hca announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the civil division of the department of justice and that payment of the amounts required by the settlement agreement would be made upon court approval of the settlement  which hca expects will occur in the first quarter of hca also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the oig 
hca is in continuing discussions with the government regarding civil issues relating to cost reporting and physician relations 
on december   hca also announced that it had signed an agreement with the criminal division of the department of justice to resolve all pending federal criminal actions against hca relating to health care billing issues 
as part of the criminal agreement  hca paid the government million and will enter certain pleas in respect of the criminal actions 
the criminal agreement is conditional upon entry of certain guilty pleas in federal district court and necessary court approvals  which hca expects will occur in the first quarter of hca also stated that representatives of state attorneys general have agreed to recommend to state officials that hca be released from corresponding criminal liability in all states in which it conducts business 
the agreements announced on december  relate only to conduct that was the subject of the federal investigations resolved in the agreements  and hca has stated publicly that it continues to discuss civil claims relating to cost reporting and physician relations with the government 
these agreements with the government do not resolve various qui tam actions filed by private parties against hca  or any pending state actions 
in addition to other claims not covered by these agreements  the government also reserved its rights under these agreements to pursue any claims it may have for 
any civil  criminal or administrative liability under the internal revenue code  
any other criminal liability  
any administrative liability  including mandatory exclusion from federal health care programs  
any liability to the united states or its agencies for any conduct other than the conduct covered in the government s investigation  
any express or implied warranty claims or other claims for defective or deficient products or services  including quality of goods and services  provided by hca  
any claims for personal injury or property damage or for other similar consequential damages arising from the conduct subject to the investigation  and 
any civil or administrative claims of the united states against individuals 
triad is unable to predict the effect or outcome of any of the ongoing investigations or qui tam and other actions  or whether any additional investigations or litigation will be commenced 
in connection with the distribution  triad entered into a distribution agreement with hca 
the terms of the distribution agreement provide that hca will indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed to indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of proceedings which may be commenced by government authorities or by private parties in the future that arise from acts  practices or omissions engaged in prior to the date of the distribution and that relate to the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed that  in the event that any hospital owned by triad at the time of the distribution is permanently excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of the proceedings described above  then hca will make a cash payment to triad  in an amount if positive equal to five times the excluded hospital s income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  management fees  impairment of long lived assets  minority interests and income taxes  as set forth on a schedule to the distribution agreement  less the net proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the excluded hospital 
triad has agreed that  in connection with the government investigations described above  it will participate with hca in negotiating one or more compliance agreements setting forth each of hca s and triad s agreements to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
hca will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for losses relating to any acts  practices or omissions engaged in by triad after the distribution  whether or not triad is indemnified for similar acts  practices and omissions occurring prior to the distribution 
if indemnified matters were asserted successfully against triad or any of its facilities  and hca failed to meet its indemnification obligations  then this event could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note agreements with hca in the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of such arrangements 
the extent to which triad may or may not continue to be affected by the ongoing investigations of hca and the initiation of additional investigations  if any  cannot be predicted 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  or results of operations in future periods 
triad is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of  or interference with  physicians staff privileges 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit triad s ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
net medicare revenues approximated in  in and in management believes that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
although medicare prospective payments will increase in  management expects that the average rate of increase in medicare prospective payments will decline slightly in and not withstanding the enactment of the refinement act and bipa 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  triad s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
health care reform in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed to congress and in some state legislatures that would significantly affect the services provided by and reimbursement to health care providers in triad s markets 
the cost of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reduction in payments by government programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers  similar to the reductions incurred as part of the balanced budget act as previously discussed 
future health care legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs may have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk triad is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
no derivatives are currently used to alter the interest rate characteristics of triad s debt instruments 
with respect to triad s interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of long term debt at december  is subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of million at december  is subject to fixed rates of interest 
the estimated fair value of triad s total long term debt was million at december  the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term debt with the same maturities 
based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential annualized losses in future pretax earnings would be approximately million 
the impact of such a change in interest rates on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
the estimated changes to interest expense and the fair value of long term debt are determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on triad s borrowing cost and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in triad s credit ratings or the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change
