effective january   the company increased the membership fee for its inner circle and business members from to paid supplemental memberships were also increased from to because members renew throughout the year and because membership fee income is realized over the life of the membership  the benefit of the fee increases will be spread over a two year period

as of january   the estimated amount decreases to approximately to million 
these amounts include estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges 
these estimates do not take into consideration the reduction in the company s contingent liability that would result from any subleasing of the properties 
pursuant to the agreements entered into in connection with the company s spin off from waban  bj s may not renew any of its real estate leases other than ground leases for which homebase may be liable during any period in which bj s does not meet certain minimum standards of creditworthiness

if this occurred  the related tax liability would be payable by homebase  although the company has agreed to indemnify homebase under certain circumstances for all or a portion of such tax liability
