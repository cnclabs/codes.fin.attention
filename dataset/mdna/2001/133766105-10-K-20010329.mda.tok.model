item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under certain factors that may affect our business and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of software solutions and strategic consulting services to participants in energy markets throughout north america and europe 
we were organized as a limited liability company on april  and acquired zai net software  lp and caminus energy limited in may  positron energy consulting in november  dc systems  inc in july and certain assets and liabilities of both nucleus corporation and nucleus energy consulting corporation  which we refer to in this annual report as nucleus  in august since the completion of these acquisitions  we expanded our organization by hiring personnel in key areas  particularly marketing  sales and research and development 
our full time employees increased from at december  to at december  to at december   and we intend to continue to increase our number of employees throughout we generate revenues from licensing our software products  providing related services for implementation consulting and support and providing strategic consulting services 
we generally license one or more products to our customers  who typically receive perpetual licenses to use our products for a specified number of servers and concurrent users 
after the initial license  they may purchase licenses for additional products  servers and users as needed 
in addition  customers often purchase professional services from us  including implementation and training services  and enter into renewable maintenance contracts that provide for software upgrades and technical support over a stated term  typically months 
we also provide strategic advice on deregulation and the restructuring of the energy industry through our strategic consulting group 
customer payments under our software license agreements are non refundable 
payment terms generally require that a significant portion of the license fee is payable on delivery of the licensed product with the balance due in installments 
we follow the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop no 
 if the license agreement does not provide for significant customization of or enhancements to the software  we recognize license revenues when a license is executed  the product has been delivered  all significant company obligations are fulfilled  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for those license agreements where customer acceptance is required and it is not probable  we recognize license revenues when the software has been accepted 
for those license agreements where the licensee requires significant enhancements or customization to adapt the software to the unique specifications of the customer or the service elements of the arrangement are considered essential to the functionality of the software products  we recognize both the license revenues and service revenues using contract accounting 
if acceptance of the software and related software services is probable  we use the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for those types of license agreements  where progress towards completion is measured by comparing software services hours incurred to estimated total hours for each software license agreement 
if acceptance of the software and related software services is not probable  then we use the completed contract method and recognize license revenues only when our obligations under the license agreement are completed and the software has been accepted 
accordingly  for these contracts  payments received and software license costs are deferred until our obligations under the license agreement are completed 
anticipated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
prior to  there were no circumstances where the percentage of completion method of contract accounting was required to be applied 
maintenance and support revenues associated with new product licenses and renewals are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
software services revenues  where the services do not significantly modify the licensed products and are not essential to their functionality and payment obligations for the licensed products are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and strategic consulting revenues are typically billed on a time and materials basis and are recognized as such services are performed 
we sell our products through our direct sales forces in north america and europe 
our strategic relationships with third parties assist in generating sales leads and provide cooperative marketing support 
in addition  our strategic consulting group not only develops its own client base but assists in generating software sales leads 
our results of operations may experience seasonal fluctuations as customers and potential customers in our industry face budgetary pressures to invest in energy software before year end 
accordingly  we may tend to report greater than expected revenues during the fourth quarter of the year and less than expected revenues during the first quarter 
revenues from customers outside the united states represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and a significant portion of our international revenues have been derived from sales of our strategic consulting services and software products in the united kingdom 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and commit significant management time and financial resources to developing our direct international sales channels 
international revenues may not  however  increase as a percentage of total revenues 
we were formed as a limited liability company in april accordingly  until our initial public offering in january  we were not subject to federal and state income taxes  except for certain new york income taxes on limited liability companies 
during january  the limited liability company merged with and into caminus corporation  a delaware corporation formed in september the adjustments to the income tax provision reflect the additional tax provision we would have recorded had we been a c corporation for the periods presented 
due to our acquisitions of dc systems  inc and nucleus and the significant changes in our operations  the fluctuation of financial results  including financial data expressed as a percentage of revenues for all periods  does not necessarily provide a meaningful understanding of the expected future results of our operations 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth the consolidated financial information expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december  and the consolidated financial information for the periods presented are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

dc systems had one major project in progress at the time of the acquisition 
this project added functionality to plant master  and was completed in the third quarter of amortization of intangible assets

comparison of the period from inception april  through december  to the year ended december  the following table sets forth the consolidated financial information expressed as a percentage of revenues for the period from inception april  through december  and for the year ended december  the consolidated financial information for the periods presented are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the period from inception through december   which is approximately eight months  is being compared to the year ended december  accordingly  increases in revenues and expenses are primarily attributable to the comparison of periods containing different numbers of months 
the discussion below outlines other trends in the business

the greater increase in license revenues as compared to the increase in software services revenues was attributable to the increase in sales of licenses whereby the revenues were recognized upon the execution of the license agreement and delivery of the software to the client 
typically  software services are provided subsequent to the recognition of the license revenues

cost of strategic consulting as a percentage of revenues was and for the and periods  respectively  and increased million  or  from million in the period to million in this increase was principally attributable to an increase in the number of our consultants  and related recruiting expenses  to support the growth in revenues 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the and periods  respectively  and increased million  or  from million in the period to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount  recruiting expenses and promotional and travel expenses associated with the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel to support the expansion of our domestic and international sales organizations

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were and for the and periods  respectively  and increased million  or  from million in the period to million in this increase was primarily due to increased staffing required to support our expanded operations in the united states and internationally and  to a lesser extent  increased costs of outside professional services and management fees 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development as a percentage of revenues was and for the and periods  respectively  and was million in the period and million in acquired in process research and development represents the fair value of the in process research and development acquired during the purchase of zai net and the purchase of dc systems  respectively 
in the opinion of management  the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  such amount was expensed on the date of acquisition 
zai net had two major projects in progress at the time of the acquisition power trading and scheduling  and gas trading and scheduling 
development of power trading and scheduling proceeded as anticipated in our year end appraisal and began generating revenues in consistent with our appraisal 
gas trading and scheduling projects were more complex than anticipated 
therefore  we revised the original estimated completion date of april to mid and further revised this estimate in conjunction with the dc systems acquisition in july in conjunction with the acquisition of dc systems  we postponed this project in order to evaluate comparable products of dc systems 
this project was abandoned in dc systems had one major project in progress at the time of the acquisition 
this project added functionality to plant master  which was completed in we believe there have been no significant changes to these estimates as of december  see note of the caminus corporation financial statements for a discussion of the calculation of acquired in process research and development 
amortization of intangible assets 
the amortization of the intangible assets represents the amortization of goodwill  which is the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired from the acquisitions of zai net  caminus limited  positron and dc systems  and other intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles as a percentage of revenues was and for the and periods  respectively  and increased million  or  from million in the period to million in the increase was primarily attributable to our incurring amortization expense related to the acquisitions for a full year versus eight months in the period  and the additional amortization expense related to the dc systems acquisition in the period

adjusted ebitda increased million  or  from million in the period to million in provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for was million and related primarily to foreign income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the period related to state and local taxes and was not significant 
if we had been a c corporation  our provision for income taxes would have been million each for the and periods 
minority interest minority interest represents the earnings attributable to the of zai net that we did not own during the period 
selected quarterly results of operations the following tables represent certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations information for each quarter in the years ended december  and  as well as such information expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
the information was derived from unaudited financial statements and has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  which consist of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for the fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
due to the acquisitions and the significant changes in our operations  the comparison of fluctuations for these time periods would not provide a meaningful understanding of our on going operations 
we believe quarter to quarter comparisons of financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance  and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the future 
see certain factors that may affect our business and the financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we expect our results of operations will fluctuate and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectation of securities analysts 
from the date of our formation as a limited liability company through december   we were not subject to federal and state income taxes  except for certain new york income taxes on limited liability companies 
the amounts in the line item of the statement of operations and other data table below titled proforma net income loss reflect the additional tax provision that we would have recorded had we been a c corporation for the periods presented

prior to the offering  we had funded our operations and acquisitions primarily from the proceeds of private equity sales and borrowings under an expired credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million  an increase of approximately million from december  our cash flow used in operating activities was primarily affected by  but not limited to  cash received from customers  cash paid to compensate employees  cash paid for professional fees  cash paid for the leasing of real estate and equipment and cash paid to third party software licensors 
we prepare our cash flow statement using the indirect method which reconciles net income or loss to cash used in operating activities 
therefore  the following discussion explains the significant items which impact the reconciliation of net loss to cash flow from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss of million  which was more than offset by non cash ipo related expenses of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the increase in accounts receivable of million was primarily related to the increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the increase in income taxes payable of million was primarily attributable to our provision for income taxes 
the loss related to the office relocation of million is primarily the net book value of furniture and leasehold improvements of our old headquarters at the time of their disposal  less proceeds received from their sale 
our cash flow used in investing activities was primarily affected by cash paid for investments in marketable securities  acquisitions and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million and resulted from the investment net of related sales of million of the net ipo proceeds in marketable securities primarily consisting of investment grade obligations of state and municipal governments and their agencies 
additionally  we paid million in connection with the nucleus acquisition in august capital expenditures of million were primarily for computer and communications equipment  purchased software  office equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
our cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily affected by  but not limited to  net cash received from issuances of common stock  cash paid to affiliates and stockholders under contractual obligations  and repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of approximately million from the sale of common stock in connection with our ipo and million from the exercise of stock options 
also  we collected subscription receivables of million 
a portion of these funds was used to repay the million outstanding balance of our credit facility and pay million due to related parties 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities primarily resulted from our net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
this was partially offset by depreciation and amortization of million  acquired in process research and development write offs of million  non cash compensation expense of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the growth of our business 
the increase in accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses was primarily related to professional fees associated with certain costs of our initial public offering 
additionally  the increase in accrued liabilities was attributable to the increase in accrued bonuses 
deferred revenues decreased approximately million during the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in deferred license revenues  partially offset by an increase in deferred maintenance revenues 
deferred license revenues decreased primarily due to completion of our obligations under certain license agreements and the acceptance of the software by the customers 
accordingly  certain license revenues  which were deferred at december   were recognized during the year ended december  during  we modified our standard license agreement by removing all acceptance criteria 
as a result  our license agreements in generally allowed for the recognition of revenues upon the execution and delivery of the software to the customer 
deferred maintenance revenues increased primarily due to a change in billing practice  where most customers are now invoiced on an annual or quarterly basis instead of a monthly basis 
our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily affected by  but not limited to  net cash paid to acquire businesses and cash paid for capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million and resulted primarily from the purchase of dc systems for million  net of cash acquired  and million in capital expenditures for computer and communications equipment  purchased software  office equipment  furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
our cash flow provided by financing activities is primarily affected by  but not limited to  net cash received from investors  net cash received under borrowings from a credit facility  cash paid to affiliates and stockholders under contractual obligations  and cash distributions paid to stockholders 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided cash of approximately million from the sale of equity  million from borrowings under a credit agreement entered into in june with fleet bank and approximately million in subscriptions received 
these funds were used for the payment of the purchase price for dc systems  an earnout to the former owners of zai net of million  to repurchase an equity interest in us held by ss c technologies  inc for million and to pay the million due under the distributor agreement with ss c and million distribution to members for taxes 
on june   we entered into a credit agreement with fleet bank which provided for total borrowings of up to million under two facilities  a revolving loan and a working capital loan 
the revolving loan provided for borrowings of up to million and the working capital loan provided for borrowings that were limited to of eligible accounts receivable  less million  which in the aggregate were not allowed to exceed million 
the loans under this agreement bore interest either at the bank s reference rate  which is generally equivalent to the published prime rate  or libor plus an applicable margin between and 
in february  the then outstanding balance was paid from the proceeds of our initial public offering and our existing credit agreement was terminated 
we expect that our working capital needs will continue to grow as we execute our growth strategy 
we believe the net proceeds from our initial public offering and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments  as well as other hedging activities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   as amended by sfas we have no derivative financial instruments and thus believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect our business we have a limited history as a combined operating entity that provides both software solutions and strategic consulting services  and we may face difficulties encountered by recently combined companies that operate in different geographic regions and provide varied products and services in april  we were organized as a limited liability company for the purpose of acquiring zai net software  lp  a software company based in new york  and caminus limited  a strategic consulting practice based in cambridge  england 
since that time we also acquired positron energy consulting  dc systems and certain assets and liabilities of nucleus 
accordingly  we have a limited history of combined operations and may face difficulties encountered by recently combined companies that operate in different geographic regions and provide varied products and services  especially in rapidly evolving markets such as the energy market 
we expect our results of operations to fluctuate and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts our revenues and results of operation have fluctuated in the past and may vary from quarter to quarter in the future 
if our quarterly results fall below the expectations of securities analysts  the price of our common stock could fall 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause variations in our results of operations  including demand for our software solutions and strategic consulting services the timing and recognition of sales of our products and services unexpected delays in developing and introducing new products and services increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration changes in the rapidly evolving market for products and services in the energy industry the mix of revenues derived from products and services the hiring  retention and utilization of personnel the mix of domestic and international revenues costs related to possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses general economic factors changes in the revenue recognition policies required by generally accepted accounting principles accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel costs  marketing programs and overhead  which cannot be adjusted quickly and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
our operating expense levels are based  in significant part  on our expectations of future revenues on a quarterly basis 
as a result  if revenues for a particular quarter are below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter  and therefore this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results and cash flows for that quarter 
in addition  we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand our sales and marketing operations  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden strategic consulting and software services and improve our operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase as quickly as these expenses  our results of operations and cash flows may suffer and our stock price may decline 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly results and the price of our common stock could fall if quarterly results are lower than the expectations of securities analysts our long sales cycle  which can range from five to six months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales may occur or revenues may be recognized 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer considering a purchase and whether we have conducted business with a potential customer in the past 
these potential customers frequently need to obtain internal approvals from multiple decision makers prior to making purchase decisions 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and results of operations for any particular period 
if our quarterly results and cash flows fall below the expectations of securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which could result in less than expected revenues our results of operations may experience seasonal fluctuations as customers and potential customers in our industry face budgetary pressures to invest in energy software before year end 
accordingly  we may tend to report greater than expected revenues during the fourth quarter of the year and less than expected revenues during the first quarter 
a limited number of customers may account for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline if we cannot keep or replace these customer relationships as our business has grown  the size of our license agreements has increased 
accordingly  we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period may depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of customers 
in addition  we anticipate that such customers will continue to vary over time  so that the achievement of our long term goals will require us to obtain additional significant customers on an ongoing basis 
our failure to enter into a sufficient number of large licensing agreements during a particular period could have a significant adverse effect on our revenues 
we may not be able to obtain or sustain market acceptance for our products and services because the market for products and services in the energy industry is rapidly evolving  a viable market for our products and services may not be sustainable 
we may not be able to continue to develop products and services that serve the changing needs of energy market participants in this evolving market 
organizations that have already invested substantial resources in proprietary or other third party solutions for buying  selling or trading energy assets may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
these factors could inhibit the market s acceptance of our products and services in particular 
the market for products and services in the energy industry is competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future  we may not be able to compete successfully the market for products and services in the energy industry is competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future as participants in the energy industry try to respond to increasing deregulation 
our primary competition currently comes from internal development efforts of energy participants for internal use or for sale to other market participants  vendors of software solutions and providers of strategic consulting services 
some of our current and many of our potential competitors have or may have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
also  our current and potential competitors have or may have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that they can leverage to gain promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive terms to purchasers than we can 
in addition  our current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services and expand their markets 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced revenues and the loss of customers  which could result in increased losses or reduced profits 
we may not be able to sufficiently expand our sales and distribution capabilities and strategic consulting services in order to increase market awareness of our products and services and increase our revenues we must expand our direct sales operations and strategic consulting services in order to increase market awareness of our products and services and generate increased revenues 
we require sales and consulting personnel with significant subject matter expertise in the energy industry 
we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of sales and consulting personnel in a timely  cost effective manner 
moreover  our strategic consulting operations are primarily based in europe  and we may encounter significant start up costs in connection with further developing our strategic consulting operations in the united states 
our revenues are substantially dependent upon sales of a limited number of software products and related services factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for our products and services  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect of our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  a significant percentage of our revenues has come from licensing our zai net manager  zai net risk analytics  zai net physicals and zai net models software and providing related services 
we currently expect that these activities will account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance will depend  in large part  on the continued market acceptance of our existing products and the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our software products and services 
we may not be successful in continuing to develop and market our zai net manager  zai net analytics  zai net physicals and zai net models software 
we may not be able to manage our expanding operations rapid growth in numerous geographic regions has placed and will continue to place a significant demand on our management  financial and operational resources 
such demands have already required us and may require us in the future to engage third party resources over which we have limited control to assist us in implementing our growth strategy 
we intend to continue to expand our us and international operations in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities and to support our growing customer base 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely and cost effective basis 
if we fail to improve our operational systems in a timely and cost effective manner  we could experience customer dissatisfaction  cost inefficiencies and lost revenue opportunities 
we face risks associated with our international operations and plans for expansion one of our key strategies is to continue to expand our international operations and sales and marketing efforts 
if we are unsuccessful  we may lose customers that operate globally  which will adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  international operations are subject to inherent risks that may limit our international expansion or cause us to incur significant costs to compete effectively in international markets 
these include the need to comply with the laws and regulations of different countries difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights in some countries difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the imposition of exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable and the existence of potentially longer payment cycles language and cultural differences local economic conditions in foreign markets for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in british pounds 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates is likely to increase as we expand our international operations 
we may not be able to integrate the operations from our recent and future acquisitions as part of our business strategy  we have completed and expect to enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions  such as our august acquisition of nucleus corporation and nucleus energy consulting corporation 
acquisition transactions are accompanied by a number of risks  including  among other things the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies the potential disruption of our ongoing business expenses associated with the transactions  including expenses associated with amortization of acquired intangible assets the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses if we fail to adapt to rapid changes in the energy market  our existing products could become obsolete the market for our products is marked by rapid changes in the regulatory environment  new product introductions and related technology enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we may not be able to successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that comply with present or emerging technology standards 
also  any new regulation or technology standard could increase our cost of doing business 
new products based on new technologies or new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
to succeed  we will need to enhance our current products and develop new products on a timely basis to keep pace with developments related to the energy market and to satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirement of customers 
software addressing the trading and management of energy assets is complex and can be expensive to develop  and new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing enhanced or new products could cause us to lose revenue opportunities and customers and could increase the cost of doing business 
our software products may contain errors or defects that could result in lost revenues  delayed or limited market acceptance or product liability claims with substantial litigation costs complex software products such as ours often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
despite internal testing and testing by customers  our current and future products may contain serious defects 
serious defects or errors could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance 
because our customers use our products for critical business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers 
they could seek significant compensation for losses from us 
although our license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations 
even if not successful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be costly and time consuming  which would require our management to spend time defending the claim rather than operating our business 
unauthorized parties may obtain and profit from our software  documentation and other proprietary information we seek to protect the source code for our proprietary software both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
our policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers and to control access to our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  such piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets where the laws of foreign countries are not as protective as they are in the us our trade secrets or confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information 
we are aware of competitors that offer similar functionality in their products 
we can provide no assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us 
we rely on outside licensors for technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of our products 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to such technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products 
others may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  which may limit our ability to conduct our business as the number of software products in the energy industry increases and the functionality of products from different software developers further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others 
although we are not currently subject to any claims of infringement  third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products 
further  we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced 
legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  and technology developed in such countries may not be protectable in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available 
in addition  we are obligated to indemnify customers against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the results of any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party may force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property obtain a license  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  to sell or use the relevant technology redesign those products or services to avoid infringement refund license fees that we have previously received our business may be harmed if we lose the services of david stoner  brian scanlan  nigel evans or other key employees our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of key employees  particularly david stoner  our chief executive officer  and brian scanlan and nigel evans  two of our founders 
these employees have significant expertise in the energy and software industries and would be difficult to replace 
our employment agreements with messrs 
stoner and scanlan and dr 
evans expire in if we lose one or more of our key employees  our business could be harmed 
if we fail to continue to attract and retain personnel with sales experience  software development skills and subject matter expertise in the energy market  our business may be harmed our future success will depend in large part on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel  particularly salespeople  software developers and consultants who are both experts in their particular fields and have strong customer relationship skills 
in particular  the number of people with significant knowledge about evolving energy markets is limited 
newly hired employees will require training and it will take time for them to achieve full productivity 
we face intense competition in recruiting and may not be able to hire enough qualified individuals in the future  and newly hired employees may not achieve necessary levels of productivity 
we may need additional financing which could be difficult to obtain and which could dilute stockholder ownership interests or the value of our common stock we intend to grow our business rapidly and may require significant external financing in the future 
obtaining additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions our operating performance investor sentiment  particularly with respect to the emerging energy market these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financing unattractive for us 
if we are unable to raise capital to fund our operations  we may not be able to successfully grow our business 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  your percentage ownership will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding stock 
we may have to issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
our performance will depend on the continued growth in demand for energy products and services our future success depends heavily on the continued growth in demand for energy products and services  which is difficult to predict 
if demand for energy products and services does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than expected  demand for our products and services will be reduced 
because a substantial portion of our operating expenses is fixed in the short term  any unanticipated reduction in demand for our products and services would negatively impact our operating results 
utilities and other businesses may be slow to adapt to changes in the energy marketplace or be satisfied with existing services and solutions 
this would cause there to be less demand for our products and services than we currently expect 
the market for energy trading software and solutions that address the deregulating energy industry is relatively new  and potential customers may wait for widespread adoption of products before making purchase commitments 
even if there is significant market acceptance of products and services for the energy industry  we may incur substantial expenses adapting our solutions to changing or emerging technologies 
the global energy industry is subject to extensive and varied governmental regulations  and our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully develop products and services that address numerous and rapidly changing regulatory regimes although the global energy industry is becoming increasingly deregulated  the energy industry  which includes utilities  producers  energy marketers  processors  storage operators  distributors  marketers  pipelines and others  is still subject to extensive and varied local  national and regional regulation 
if we are unable to design and develop software solutions and strategic consulting services that address the numerous and changing regulatory requirements  or fail to alter our products and services rapidly enough  our customers or potential customers may not purchase our products and services 
our financial success is closely linked to the health of the energy industry we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from licensing our software and providing strategic consulting services to participants in the energy industry 
our customers include a number of organizations in the energy industry  and the success of these customers is linked to the health of the energy market 
in addition  because of the capital expenditures required in connection with investing in our products and services  we believe that demand for our products and services could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability or downturns in the energy market  which may cause customers and potential customers to leave the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for our software products and related strategic consulting services 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in quarterly operating results announcements  by us or our competitors  of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments additions or departures of key personnel future sales of common stock changes in financial estimates by securities analysts loss of a major customer we may incur significant costs from class action litigation in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its stock 
such volatility has been particularly common in technology companies 
we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of us certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control  even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
any of these provisions could reduce the market price of our common stock 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders prohibiting stockholder action by written consent establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings we are subject to the provisions of section of the general corporation law of delaware 
section will prohibit us from engaging in certain business combinations  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
accordingly  section may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  debt instruments of state and municipal governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  money market instruments and bank certificates of deposit 
as of december   we invested the net proceeds from our initial public offering in similar investment grade and highly liquid investments 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of our subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of foreign denominated sales and purchases 
the results of operations of our subsidiaries  as reported in us dollars  may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the local currencies in which we transact business 
such amount is recorded upon the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars  and is dependent upon the various foreign exchange rates and the magnitude of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
at december   our foreign currency translation adjustment was not material and  for the year ended december   net foreign currency transaction losses were insignificant 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in british pounds 
historically  the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates has not had a material impact on our operations 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will increase as we expand our international operations 
we conduct our european operations in the united kingdom and the countries of the european union which are part of the european monetary union 
there is a single currency within certain countries of the european union  known as the euro  and one organization  the european central bank is responsible for setting european monetary policy 
we have reviewed the impact the euro has on our business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in our commercial operations or treasury management functions 
because our european transactions are primarily denominated in british pounds and as yet we have not experienced any significant impact on our european operations from the fluctuations in the exchange rate between euro and british pounds  we do not believe that the euro conversion will have any material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
