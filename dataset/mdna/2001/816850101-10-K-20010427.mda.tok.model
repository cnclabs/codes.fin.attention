item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market a wide range of analog and mixed signal semiconductors for commercial and military applications 
our products are sold principally to customers in the computer  communications and industrial markets 
computer market applications include desktop computers  servers  workstations  laptop computers  personal digital assistants pdas and computer add on cards 
products within the communications market include local area networks  wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial applications include automated test equipment ate  medical devices and factory automation systems 
our focus on these commercial applications over the past several years represents a substantial transition from our historical business  which was predominantly military and aerospace applications 
sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many large commercial customers  particularly in the personal computer industry  include terms in their purchase orders  which provide liberal cancellation provisions 
recent trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we expect the percentage of turns fill business orders received and shipped within the same quarter to increase as a percentage of net sales 
one of our strategies is to expand our business through strategic acquisitions 
over the past five years  we have made several small acquisitions in order to increase our pool of skilled technical personnel and penetrate new market segments such as high performance  advanced communications  and human interface and system management devices 
these acquisitions include usar systems incorporated  practical sciences  inc  acapella limited and edge semiconductor 
the acquisitions of usar  acapella and edge were accounted for as poolings of interests 
the results of operations described below give effect to our two for one stock splits in the form of percent stock dividends that were paid on september  and september  market update the semiconductor and electronics industries have experienced very weak market conditions so far in calendar year excess inventory levels and slowing end market demand have adversely affected macro conditions within the semiconductor industry 
industry sources have forecasted that worldwide year over year sales of semiconductors could be down as much as percent in calendar year many of our customers and competitors have forecasted their results will be down dramatically in calendar year in comparison to the prior year 
consistent with these trends  we have revised our forecast as a result of weak demand from the communications infrastructure and ate markets 
we had received a limited amount of turns filled orders from the communications market during the first quarter  and had to cancel backlog for many communications customers 
additionally  a significant amount of backlog for the ate market was rescheduled to reflect customers revised forecasts 
finally  demand from the computer market was relatively stable 
ultimately  we believe our new product developments and strategic focus should allow us to remain well positioned within the marketplace 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
we generally recognized product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
net sales for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year  a percent increase 
this increase was due in part to favorable market conditions in the overall semiconductor industry and the growth in sales into the communications and industrial end market 
gross profit 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  direct labor and overhead 
cost of inventory is determined by the first in  first out method 
gross profit for fiscal year was million  compared to million for the comparable period in the prior year  a percent increase 
our gross margins defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales are generally affected by price changes over the life of the products and the overall mix of products sold 
higher gross margins are generally expected from new products and improved production efficiencies as a result of increased utilization 
conversely  prices for existing products generally will continue to decrease over their respective life cycles 
our gross margin was percent for fiscal year this compared to a gross margin of percent for fiscal year the improvement is attributed to increased operating efficiencies associated with higher shipment levels  higher revenue contribution from products introduced in the last eighteen months  and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher margin product lines 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
operating costs and expenses were million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal year operating costs and expenses for fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales 
operating costs and expenses  as a percentage of net sales  are lower for fiscal year than previous levels due to higher shipment rates and greater efficiencies 
sg a expenses for fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales  compared to million  or percent of net sales for fiscal year the increase in expenditures was due primarily to the overall growth of our business  while the decrease in percentage of net sales reflects higher revenues and greater efficiencies 
r d expenses were relatively consistent  as a percentage of net sales  at million  or percent of net sales in fiscal year  up percent from million  or percent of net sales in fiscal year we continue to invest heavily in areas deemed critical for developing and marketing new products  which are generally targeted at broadening our customer base  product lines and end product applications 
operating costs and expenses for fiscal year include one time costs of  associated with the december acquisition of usar systems 
interest and other income 
interest and other income of million was realized in fiscal year  up dramatically from interest and other income of million in fiscal year interest and other income in fiscal year is made up primarily of interest income 
for fiscal year  interest and other income and expenses was primarily interest income 
the significant increase in interest and other income in fiscal year over the prior year was income attributable to cash provided by the february issuance of million in convertible subordinated debentures 
interest income from investments made with the debenture proceeds far exceed the fixed interest expense paid to bond holders 
provision for taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year  an effective tax rate of percent 
provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year  an effective tax rate of percent 
the decline is due to increased sales through foreign based subsidiaries that are in lower tax jurisdictions

the notes are due in seven years from the date of issuance and callable by the company after three years 
we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  including working capital  expansion of sales  marketing and customer service capabilities  and product development 
in addition  we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
on january   we had working capital of million  compared with million at january  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at january  was to  compared to to at january  a majority of the increase was due to cash generated by the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year net income for fiscal year was reduced by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
net operating cash flows were favorably impacted by net income of million compared to million in the prior year 
net operating activities for fiscal year were positively impacted by an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and the impact of the tax benefit from stock option exercises 
these items were partially offset by increases in receivables  inventories  income taxes refundable  and other assets as well as a reduction in income taxes payable and other liabilities 
investing activities used million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year investing activities in fiscal year consists of increases in temporary investments  investments with maturities in excess of year and capital expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for the comparable prior year period reflects a million addition to property  plant and equipment and million increase in temporary investments 
our financing activities provided positive cash flows of million during fiscal year and used million in the prior year 
financing activities for fiscal year reflect the proceeds  net of related fees  from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures  cash provided by stock option exercises  offset by the repurchase of treasury stock 
financing activities for the comparable prior year period represented cash from stock option exercises  cash used and proceeds from the repurchase and reissuance of treasury stock  and the cash effects of a pooling of interests 
we had a credit arrangement with a financial institution for borrowings up to million at an interest rate of the day commercial paper plus percent 
our credit arrangement expired in august  and we did not extend or renew this credit facility 
through our foreign subsidiary  we maintain an overdraft credit line in the amount of  pounds sterling 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under any credit facility 
in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we had to make significant expenditures during the past five years 
these investments aimed at developing new products  including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment  will continue 
we fully intend to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and cash on hand 
purchases of new capital equipment were made primarily to improve internal computer systems and expand manufacturing capacity 
funding for these purchases was made from our operating cash flows and cash reserves 
we have made significant investments in product and process technology 
we believe that sales generating cash flows  together with the proceeds of the debt offering  cash reserves and existing credit facilities  are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years 
a significant increase in inflation would affect our future performance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  exist in nondollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the nondollar denominated currencies are principally german deutschmarks  british pounds sterling and french francs 
additionally  certain of our current and long term liabilities are denominated principally in british pounds sterling currencies  which are also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  we do not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
likewise  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
interest rate risk as of january   we had million in long term debt outstanding at a fixed interest rate of percent 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure
