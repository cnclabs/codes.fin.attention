year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal of million  a increase compared to the prior year  was the eighth consecutive year roper established a record high 
excluding net sales to rao gazprom gazprom  a large russian natural gas company  net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal were less than pro forma net sales for fiscal assuming fiscal acquisitions occurred at the same time in fiscal net sales for roper s analytical instrumentation segment increased  mostly the result of business acquisitions petroleum analyzer  masd  antek instruments and other smaller businesses 
this segment s net sales were less than the prior year s pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid properties test equipment markets 
net sales for roper s fluid handling segment increased  mostly the result of business acquisitions flowdata  cybor and abel pump and a very strong fiscal for this segment s semiconductor related business 
this segment s net sales were higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal fluid handling s historical semiconductor business increased its net sales in fiscal by partly from favorable comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of fiscal and its recently acquired business increased its net sales by compared to the same period in the prior year 
fiscal net sales for this segment s centrifugal pump business decreased compared to the prior year due to weak agricultural and water wastewater markets 
agricultural markets were adversely impacted by widespread drought conditions and low commodity prices in the united states 
roper believes the municipal water and wastewater markets were adversely affected by resources diverted to minimize yk exposures early in the fiscal year  and its centrifugal pump business had increased exposure to these markets as it developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative projects 
fluid handling s piston metering pumps business net sales were also down compared to fiscal as this company s largest customer reduced its purchases until it resolves an fda compliance problem unrelated to this company s products 
this company does not expect shipments to this customer to return to previous levels in the near future 
net sales for roper s industrial controls segment decreased less than in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal net sales were less than pro forma fiscal net sales 
the timing of this segment s primary fiscal acquisition hansen technologies was such that it did not significantly affect fiscal results 
this segment was significantly influenced by conditions in the exploration and production sectors of the oil gas industry 
roper believes several large oil gas business combinations early in the year delayed capital spending programs  and spending had yet to recover from the effects of relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of fiscal throughout fiscal  net sales each quarter excluding sales to gazprom improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal whereas these first quarter net sales were down compared to the prior year  fourth quarter net sales also excluding hansen technologies were up 
net sales to gazprom of million in fiscal were comparable to fiscal net sales of million 
the gross profit percentage for the analytical instrumentation segment decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease arose mostly from the inclusion of masd for most of fiscal if masd s results were excluded from the segment s results in fiscal  the segment s gross profit percentage was 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and fiscal are presented in the following table 
total excl 
goodwill amort 
total excl 
goodwill amort analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls corporate total sg a expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for roper as a whole because of the increased costs in the fluid handling segment and the increased size of the analytical instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of sg a expenses compared to roper s other business segments 
sg a expenses for the fluid handling segment increased as a percentage of net sales mostly due to relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions  particularly abel pump and flowdata 
roper expects to bring these cost structures more in line with the segment s other businesses 
another significant reason for this segment s increased sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales was the adverse leverage associated with the decline in the segment s centrifugal pump business combined with the added costs of this business moving into a larger facility early in fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense was higher in fiscal due primarily to the borrowings associated with the numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal and especially during fiscal all of these acquisitions  representing total costs of approximately million during these two fiscal years  were paid for with cash provided by roper s then existing credit facilities 
the provision for income taxes was of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in the effective income tax rate was due to several of the recent acquisitions located in relatively high income tax rate jurisdictions and the amortization of some of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired goodwill which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
roper s other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these net assets were primarily denominated in euros  british pounds or japanese yen 
the us dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal  but especially against the euro and particularly during roper s fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  roper s consolidated net assets decreased million million in the fourth quarter due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
roper s goodwill denominated in non us currencies also decreased by million due to currency translation adjustments 
therefore  the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments during fiscal on roper s future cash flows is expected to be immaterial to roper s future cash flows 
the following table summarizes roper s net sales orders and sales order backlog information in thousands 
the pro forma amounts include comparable time periods for those companies acquired during fiscal net sales orders year ended october  sales order backlog october  actual pro forma actual actual pro forma actual analytical instrumentation     fluid handling       industrial controls       the increase in analytical instrumentation s net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an increase in the segment s digital imaging businesses and a increase in its spectroscopy business which was influenced by the strong semiconductor industry 
the increase in fluid handling s net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in the segment s semiconductor related businesses  whose net sales orders increased 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal of million represented the seventh consecutive year that roper established a record high 
net sales  excluding sales to gazprom  increased for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  total industrial controls net sales decreased due mostly to difficult market conditions throughout the oil gas industry as oil and natural gas prices were at historical lows in the early part of fiscal  and consolidation within the industry 
each of these factors caused reductions in capital spending by roper s customers during fiscal net sales to gazprom were million for the year ended october   down from fiscal  as a result of dropping certain low margin  pass through products from the contract 
total analytical instrumentation net sales increased due to full year contributions from the fiscal acquisitions of acton research february and photometrics march  the partial year contribution from the fiscal petroleum analyzer acquisitions june and improved market conditions for the segment s digital imaging business 
on a pro forma basis  analytical instrumentation net sales increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
total fluid handling net sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal poor semiconductor equipment industry conditions that affected the fluid handling segment primarily in the first half of fiscal offset the strength in the segment s centrifugal pump business as several new product offerings were very well received by the market 
industrial controls gross profit percentage increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the major reason for the increase was the elimination of certain low margin business with gazprom in fiscal analytical instrumentation s gross profit also increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the major contributors to this increase were a million inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the realization of cost structure improvements at those businesses acquired over the past two years and volume leverage 
fluid handling s gross profit increased points in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this gain resulted from a number of factors  including improved product mix in fiscal from larger diameter centrifugal pumps  an improved power generation market  the leverage of improved semiconductor industry conditions in the second half of fiscal  and improved cost structures throughout the segment 
every one of this segment s businesses improved gross margins in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  the improved consolidated gross profit percentage of points in fiscal was due mostly to increased higher margin analytical instrumentation sales 
sg a expenses increased in fiscal compared to the year ended october  mostly due to the partial year costs associated with petroleum analyzer 
as a percentage of sales  these costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was attributed mostly to the increased size of the analytical instrumentation segment  whose businesses typically have higher engineering and amortization costs compared to roper s other business segments 
analytical instrumentation s sg a costs were and of sales in fiscal and  respectively 
comparative percentages for the industrial controls and fluid handling segments were each within point for these years 
excluding million of russian related reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the industrial controls segment  this segment s sg a costs were about the same in fiscal as in fiscal interest expense was lower during the year ended october  compared to fiscal  with lower interest rates throughout most of fiscal as compared to fiscal the german revolving credit facility opened in june also accrued interest at a relatively low rate compared to us borrowings 
average debt levels were about higher in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the effective income tax rate was for the year ended october  and for the year ended october  the differences between the statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for these years were not considered significant 
average outstanding shares were less in fiscal than fiscal as a result of the repurchase of million shares by roper during the fourth quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal the buy back program was terminated in may other components of comprehensive earnings represented the change in cumulative translation adjustments related to the net assets of non us subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 
the net change during each of fiscal and fiscal was related to roper s subsidiaries in europe and japan 
net cash provided by operating activities declined by million  or  primarily as a result of a million increase in accounts receivable as compared to a million decrease in the fiscal years ended october  and october   respectively 
the reduction in was attributable to exceptional gazprom cash receipts and the increase in arose primarily at roper scientific and integrated designs largely as a result of increased fourth quarter business levels 
the following table summarizes net sales orders and sales order backlog information dollars in thousands net sales orders year ended october  sales order backlog october  actual pro forma actual actual pro forma actual analytical instrumentation     fluid handling       industrial controls       on a pro forma basis to include fiscal acquisitions for the comparable prior year period  analytical instrumentation s net sales orders and sales order backlog were up and down  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated pro forma net sales orders and sales order backlog were down and down  respectively 
actual compared to pro forma results were about the same for the fluid handling and industrial controls segments 
the increase in analytical instrumentation s net sales orders was due to the full year contributions of acton research and photometrics  the partial year contribution of petroleum analyzer and strengthened digital imaging markets in fiscal which also accounts for the pro forma increase 
fluid handling s net sales orders increased from its stronger centrifugal pump business and the increased sales order backlog reflected much better semiconductor industry conditions 
decreased industrial controls net sales orders reflected weak oil gas industry conditions 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  total debt was million at october  of total capital compared to million at october  of total capital 
roper s increased financial leverage at october  compared to the prior year was due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal business acquisitions 
roper s principal million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of its daily external financing requirements  consisting of revolving loans  swing line loans and letters of credit 
this facility also provides that up to million of borrowings may be denominated in designated non us currencies 
at october   million of non us denominated borrowings and the equivalent of million of non us denominated borrowings were outstanding under this facility 
total unused availability under this facility was million at october  this facility matures may roper s outstanding indebtedness at october  also included million of term notes 
one set of notes totaling million bears interest at and matures may the other set of notes totaling million bears interest at and matures may neither set of notes requires sinking fund payments 
roper s other outstanding indebtedness at october  totaled million 
million of this amount was with japanese banks to fund normal business requirements of its japanese operations 
most of the increase in working capital at october  compared to october  resulted from the working capital of the businesses acquired during fiscal approximately million of working capital  excluding cash  was acquired with these businesses 
another large increase in working capital resulted from refinancing the short term german revolving credit facility borrowings of million that existed at october  this agreement was replaced by the non us borrowing capabilities of the million credit facility 
roper had significant capital expenditures of million during the year ended october  in order to expand or move to larger facilities at roper pump  cornell pump and compressor controls 
research and development related capital expenditures were also significant at gatan and roper scientific  two of roper s digital imaging businesses 
roper anticipates capital expenditures will decline in fiscal in november  roper s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock from per share to per share  an increase of 
this represents the eighth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper s initial public offering 
there are no plans for further dividend increases during fiscal roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under its various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although roper maintains an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on roper s activities  financial condition and results of operations 
roper may also explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources 
roper anticipates that its recently acquired companies as well as its other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which roper historically has experienced 
however  the rate at which roper can reduce its debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty 
recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and subsequently amended by sfas and sfas that will be applicable to roper in its first quarter of fiscal once adopted  this standard is not expected to significantly affect roper s financial position  operating results or disclosures 
see note to roper s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this pronouncement 
the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements  that will be applicable to roper in its first quarter of fiscal sab reflects the basic principles of revenue recognition in existing generally accepted accounting principles and does not supersede any existing authoritative literature 
sab represents the interpretations and practices of the securities and exchange commission in administering the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws 
once adopted  these guidelines are not expected to significantly affect roper s revenue recognition practices 
see note to roper s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this pronouncement 
other accounting pronouncements have also been released whose effective dates were not yet applicable to roper s fiscal financial statements 
however  none of these other standards are expected to significantly affect roper s future financial statements 
outlook fiscal is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings 
fiscal is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from all of the acquisitions completed during fiscal whereas the oil gas industry has been a difficult market for roper during the past two fiscal years  roper s industrial controls segment the segment most dependent on this industry had its highest level of sales and sales order bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal than in any other quarter during this period 
roper is hopeful that this trend will continue 
as announced previously  roper has extended its long term supply agreement with gazprom whereby gazprom will be supplied with an additional million of equipment over and above the original agreement through december roper expects that this extension will result in relatively consistent shipments to gazprom in the near term 
roper expects to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions and their impact on roper s results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted 
forward looking information the information provided elsewhere in this annual report  in roper s filings with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases and in other public disclosures contains forward looking statements about roper s businesses and prospects 
these forward looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as believe  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  foresee  likely  will or other similar words or phrases 
similarly  statements that describe roper s objectives  plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which generally are beyond roper s control and which may cause roper s actual results  performance or achievements to be different from any future results  performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements 
some of these risks include continuing improvement in roper s oil gas markets  the level and timing of future business with gazprom and other eastern european customers  changes in interest rates  and the future operating results of the recently and any newly acquired companies 
there is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on roper s future operations  financial condition  or financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings 
it is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
it is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock 
at october   roper had a combination of fixed rate borrowings primarily million of term notes and relatively variable rate borrowings primarily borrowings under the million credit facility 
although each borrowing under the million credit facility has a fixed rate  the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only months 
at october   interest rates were higher than the fixed rates on the term notes 
this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being less than the face amounts of the notes 
roper estimated this difference to be million and it represented an unrecorded increase in roper s net assets at october  if interest rates had been higher  the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have increased to million 
at october   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings under the million credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase roper s annualized interest costs by  several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros or equivalent currencies  british pounds or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of roper s total sales 
the us dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal british pound and japanese yen and especially against the euro and especially during the fourth quarter 
these exchange rate changes adversely impacted fiscal sales by approximately million  or less than of total sales 
the percentage impact on earnings was similar 
a similar strengthening of the us dollar against these currencies in fiscal can be expected to have a similar adverse impact on roper s financial results 
the weakening of these currencies during fiscal also resulted in a reduction of net assets that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings 
the decrease during fiscal was million 
however  roper s future cash flow exposure to this change in exchange rates was expected to be minimal 
the traded price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in roper s financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share 
certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly related to roper s stock price 
the stock price also affects roper s employees perceptions of various roper programs that involve its common stock
