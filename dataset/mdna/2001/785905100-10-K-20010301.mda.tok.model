the company faces competition from established and emerging travel distribution channels 
many of the company s competitors in the travel marketing and distribution business are well funded and have major travel suppliers as significant shareholders 
the company s travel marketing and distribution business includes channels of distribution that target the travel agency  business to business  and business to consumer segments of the global travel distribution market 
in all of these distribution channels  the company faces significant competitors in the travel marketing and distribution business 
in the travel agency channel  the company s sabre registered trademark global distribution system competes primarily against other large and well established global distribution systems  including those operated by amadeus  galileo and worldspan 
airlines are significant owners of each of those global distribution system competitors 
sabre is the only global distribution system in which no airline is a significant owner 
in addition  the company faces competition in the travel agency channel from travel suppliers that distribute directly to travel agencies and from non global distribution system companies 
in the business to business channel  the company s getthere sm and sabre registered trademark business travel solutions suite of products compete not only against similar products offered by amadeus  galileo and worldspan  but also with products offered by new competitors  including oracle and sap 
some of these competitors effectively market business travel systems that are bundled with financial and other non travel software systems that are not offered by the company 
in the business to consumer channel  the company s travelocity 
com product offering competes not only against similar products offered by amadeus  galileo and worldspan  but also with a large number of travel web sites  including those operated by travel suppliers and by expedia an affiliate of microsoft corporation and priceline 
airlines and other travel suppliers have significant ownership stakes in some of these competitors 
in addition  various airlines have recently established their own travel distribution web sites  and several have announced plans to create multi airline travel distribution web sites such as those proposed in the us by orbitz and in europe by the online travel portal 
although government authorities in some jurisdictions are examining whether the content and features made available through multi airline web sites by their owner airlines must also be made available to competitor web sites  and although orbitz is under investigation by the us departments of justice and transportation  it is uncertain whether the various governments will act to require carriers owning multi carrier sites to treat competing sites in a fair and non discriminatory way 
furthermore  many travel suppliers offer lower prices when their products and services are purchased directly from the supplier  such as through its own web site  than when they are offered by the company 
travel agency consolidation and increased competition for travel agency subscribers may result in increased expenses or reduced revenue and market position 
the absolute and relative size of the company s travel agency subscriber base is important to the company s success 
travel suppliers have reduced commissions paid to travel agencies  which has forced some smaller travel agencies to close or to combine with larger agencies 
although the company has a leading share of large travel agencies  competition is particularly intense among global distribution systems for travel agency subscribers 
the potential for the company to add new travel agency subscribers exists primarily outside of north america 
some of the company s competitors aggressively pay economic incentives to travel agencies to obtain business 
in order to compete  the company may need to increase incentives  increase spending on marketing or product development  or otherwise take actions adverse to the company 
if the company does not retain subscribers representing a significant percentage of historic bookings through the sabre registered trademark global distribution system  the company s booking fee revenues would decrease 
airlines that are divesting their ownership of global distribution systems might limit their participation in the company s travel marketing and distribution services 
rules in the united states  canada and the european union govern computer reservation systems such as the company s global distribution system 
airlines that divest their ownership of computer reservation systems such as american  british airways  us airways  and continental airlines may not be subject to the rules in these jurisdictions  which would otherwise require them to participate in the company s global distribution system in a non discriminatory manner 
the company could be adversely affected by a decision by one or more large airlines to discontinue or to lower its level of participation in the company s global distribution system 
regulatory developments could limit the company s ability to compete 
the us department of transportation is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of its rules governing computer reservation systems such as the company s global distribution system 
it is unclear at this time when the department of transportation will complete its review and what changes  if any  will be made to the us rules 
the company could be unfairly and adversely affected if the us rules are retained as to traditional global distribution systems used by travel agencies but are not applied to business to consumer travel distribution web sites owned by more than one airline 
the company could also be adversely affected if changes to the us rules increased its cost of doing business  weakened the non discriminatory participation rules to allow one or more large airlines to discontinue or to lower its level of participation in the company s global distribution system  or caused the company to be subject to rules that do not apply to its travel marketing and distribution competitors 
the company may lose certain current principal outsourcing customers 
a principal information technology solutions customer us airways might be acquired by another airline 
if us airways were to be acquired  it might reduce the amount of services currently provided by the company 
american is the company s largest customer for information technology solutions services 
in march  american s parent company  amr  distributed to its shareholders its controlling interest in the company 
thus  american may now have a greater incentive to negotiate lower prices and better terms in its contracts with the company  or to award business to competitors of the company 
rapid technological changes and new distribution channels may render the company s technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of its services to customers 
new distribution channels and technology in the travel marketing and distribution business and the outsourcing and software solutions business are rapidly emerging  such as the internet  computer on line services  private networks  cellular telephones and other wireless communications devices 
the company s ability to compete in the travel marketing and distribution business and outsourcing and software solutions business  and the company s future results  depend in part on its ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to its technology and to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands and rapid advancements in technology 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that products  technologies or services developed by others will not render the company s offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which the company focuses its research and development investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
the company s systems may suffer failures  capacity constraints and business interruptions  which could increase the company s operating costs and cause the company to lose customers 
the company s travel marketing and distribution and outsourcing and software solutions businesses are largely dependent on the company s computer data centers and network systems 
the company relies on several communications service suppliers to provide network access between the company s computer data center and end users of the company s travel marketing and distribution and outsourcing and software solutions services 
the company occasionally experiences system interruptions that make the company s global distribution system or other data processing services unavailable 
much of the company s computer and communications hardware is located in a single facility 
our systems might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquakes and similar events 
computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions might cause system interruptions  delays and loss of critical data and could significantly diminish the company s reputation and brand name and prevent it from providing services 
although the company believes it has taken adequate steps to address these risks  the company could be harmed by outages in or unreliability of the data center or network systems 
the company s revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on the airlines 
most of the company s revenue is derived from airlines  hotel operators and car rental companies and other suppliers in the travel and transportation industries 
the company s revenue increases and decreases with the level of travel and transportation activity  and is therefore highly subject to declines in or disruptions to travel and transportation 
factors that may adversely affect travel and transportation activity include price escalation in travel related industries  airline or other travel related labor action  political instability and hostilities  bad weather  fuel price escalation  increased occurrence of travel related accidents  acts of terrorism  and economic downturns and recessions 
the travel industry is seasonal  and the company s revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company faces trade barriers outside of north america that limit its ability to compete 
trade barriers erected by non us travel suppliers historically often government owned have on occasion prevented the company from offering its products and services in their markets or have denied the company content or features that they give to the company s competitors 
those trade barriers make the company s products and services less attractive to travel agencies in those countries than other global distribution systems that have such capability and have restricted the ability of the company to gain market share outside of the us competition in those countries could require the company to increase incentives  reduce prices  increase spending on marketing or product development  or otherwise to take actions adverse to the company 
the company s international operations are subject to other risks 
the company faces risks inherent in international operations  such as risks of currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  import or export licensing requirements  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  nationalization  different accounting practices and potentially longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  higher costs of doing business  consumer protection laws and restrictions on pricing or discounts  lack of or the failure to implement the appropriate infrastructure to support the company s technology  disruptions of capital and trading markets  laws and policies of the us affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and tax and other laws 
these risks may adversely affect the company s ability to conduct and grow business internationally 
the company may not successfully make and integrate business combinations and strategic alliances 
the company plans to continue to enter into business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence 
those transactions with other companies create risks such as difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  disruption of the company s ongoing business  including loss of management focus on existing businesses and other market developments  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses  impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners  and fluctuations in value and losses that may arise from equity investments 
in addition  the company may not be able to identify suitable candidates for business combinations and strategic investments or to make such business combinations and strategic investments on acceptable terms
