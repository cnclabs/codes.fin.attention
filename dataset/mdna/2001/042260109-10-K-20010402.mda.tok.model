sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements  and is effective in the fourth quarter of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the year ended december  forward looking statements we believe that it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
accordingly  this report contains discussion of events or results that have not yet occurred or been realized 
you can identify this type of discussion  which is often termed forward looking statements  by such words and phrases as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates and could be 
execution of acquisition strategies  expansion of product lines and increase of distribution networks or product sales are as  among others  whose future success may be difficult to predict 
you should read forward looking statements carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position  or state other expectations of future performance 
the actions of current and potential new competitors  changes in technology  seasonality  business cycles and new regulatory requirements are factors that impact greatly upon strategies and expectations and are outside our direct control 
there may be events in the future that we are not able accurately to predict or to control 
any cautionary language in this report provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ from the expectations we express in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of certain of the events described in this report could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we utilize leveraged financial instruments or other derivatives 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity security price risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit agreement and our short term monetary investments 
borrowings under credit agreement are variable based upon the lender s base rate or eurodollar rate 
assuming our current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the base rate or eurodollar rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates earned on short term money market instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments  only a risk related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
derivative instruments are not presently used to adjust the company s interest rate risk profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge this interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
we partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments by maintaining operating accounts in these foreign countries  and by having several customers pay us in those same currencies 
equity security price risk 
we hold a small portfolio of marketable equity traded securities that are subject to market price volatility 
equity price fluctuations of plus or minus would have had a  impact on the value of these securities in we held no such securities in risks associated with international operations the company does business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia  south america  russia  and cis 
the company has invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plans to continue to do so in the future 
the company s international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company and its operating companies 
the company does not have political risk insurance in the countries in which it currently conducts business  but does periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to the company s interests in its operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for the company to enforce its rights 
accordingly  the company may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
