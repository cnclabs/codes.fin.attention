item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview of fiscal during the past three years  our energy operations have become an increasingly significant aspect of our company 
this results not only from our acquisitions of energy companies and energy assets  but also from the sale of our small ticket leasing business and our determination  in fiscal  to focus our real estate finance operations on managing our existing portfolio rather than acquiring new real estate loans 
the expansion of our energy operations over the past three years is shown in the following tables  which have been restated to reflect the sale of our equipment leasing business in august revenues as a percent of total revenues years ended september  energy real estate finance assets as a percent of total assets years ended september  energy real estate finance the balance in  in and in is attributable to revenues derived from corporate assets not allocated to a specific industry segment 
the balance in  in and in is attributable to corporate assets not attributable to a specific industry segment 
energy assets expressed as a percent of total assets  excluding cash  were  and for the fiscal years ending september  and  respectively 
results of operations energy in august  we acquired viking resources 
results of operations for fiscal include the operations of this company for only the one month period from its date of acquisition and  accordingly  are not comparable to the similar periods of the subsequent years 
the following tables set forth information relating to revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred  daily production volumes  average sales prices  production costs as a percentage of natural gas and oil sales  and production cost per mcfe for our energy operations during fiscal  and years ended september  in thousands revenues production    well drilling    well services    transportation    gain on sales of assets  costs and expenses production    exploration   well drilling    well services    transportation   non direct    years ended september  revenues in thousands gas    oil    production volumes gas mcf day    oil bbls day average sales price gas per mcf oil per bbl production costs as a percent of sales per mcfe 


excludes sales of residual gas and sales to landowners 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in the average sales price of natural gas partially offset by a decrease in production volumes 
the million increase in gas revenues consisted of million attributable to price increases  partially offset by  attributable to volume decreases 
our oil revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from a decrease in production volumes  partially offset by a increase in the average sales price of oil 
the  decrease in oil revenues consisted of  attributable to volume decreases partially offset by  attributable to price increases 
our well drilling revenues and expenses in fiscal represent the billing and costs associated with the completion of net wells for partnerships sponsored by atlas america in fiscal as compared to wells completed in fiscal our gross profit from drilling operations was million a margin in fiscal  as compared to million a margin in fiscal the increase in gross profit for fiscal arose from a increase in the number of wells drilled which resulted from an increase in the funds we were able to obtain from investors for our drilling partnerships 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our average revenue per well and an increase in the average cost per well 
both the revenue and cost per well are affected by changes in oil and gas prices and competition for drilling equipment and services 
demand for drilling equipment and services increased in fiscal year ended september  as compared to the prior year as a result of general increases in the prices obtainable for natural gas  thereby  increasing the cost to us 
well services revenues increased as a result of an increase in the number of wells we operate 
the increase in the number of wells resulted from new partnership wells drilled during fiscal and as discussed above 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in gas marketing revenues  associated with the termination of our activities in this area 
our well service expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the increase in fiscal resulted from an increase in labor costs due to the increase in the number of wells we service 
our transportation revenues  which are derived from our natural gas transportation agreements with partnerships we sponsor  increased slightly due to volumes associated with the additional wells drilled and pipelines acquired 
our transportation expenses decreased in fiscal as a result of estimates of certain maintenance and repair costs associated with our acquisition of viking resources in fiscal our production costs decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average production cost decreased 
to 
per mcf in fiscal from 
per mcf in fiscal the decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects efficiencies we realized through our consolidation of field operations subsequent to various acquisitions 
our exploration costs were million in fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal this increase was due to increased personnel and operating expenses resulting from our increased drilling activities 
our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal these expenses include  among other things  salaries and benefits not allocated to a specific business segment  the costs of running the energy corporate office and outside services 
these expenses increased in part due to the increased operations of our energy division 
in addition  costs and expenses associated with our public pipeline subsidiary  atlas pipeline  increased  in part due to a full year of operations in fiscal also  syndication expenses and outside services increased  during fiscal as the amount of funds raised for our drilling partnerships increased and the increased drilling and servicing activity referred to above 
depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the variance from period to period is directly attributable to changes in our oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas 
higher gas prices caused depletion as a percentage of oil and gas to decrease 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our natural gas revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the completion of wells and the additional viking resources production  and a increase in the average sales price of natural gas 
of the million increase in gas revenues  million was attributable to volume increases while million was attributable to price increases 
our oil revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase was due to a increase in production volumes  principally due to the additional viking resources production  and a increase in the average sales price of oil 
of the million increase in oil revenues  million was attributable to volume increases while  was attributable to price increases 
without the addition of viking resources  gas and oil revenues would have been million and million  respectively  resulting in an overall increase of million compared to fiscal average daily gas production volumes would have been  mcf  a increase compared to fiscal the average sales price per mcf would have been per mcf as compared to per mcf 
average daily oil production volumes would have decreased barrels per day from  offset by a increase in the average sales price per barrel of oil to 
our well drilling revenues and expenses in fiscal represent the billing and costs associated with the completion of wells for partnerships sponsored by atlas america and viking resources as compared to wells completed in fiscal  an increase of wells 
well services revenues and related costs increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of wells operated due to the acquisition of viking resources and the operations associated with new partnership wells drilled during the year 
transportation revenues increased million to million in the year ended september   as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this increase principally resulted from the additional revenue associated with the acquisition of viking resources and its pipeline operations 
our production costs  excluding exploration costs of million  increased million to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of viking resources interests in producing properties and the drilling activities referred to above 
our transportation expenses increased million to million as compared to the same period of the prior year 
of this increase  million was related to the acquisition of viking resources and its pipeline operations 
our non direct expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal fiscal non direct expenses increased due to the growth in our energy division 
atlas pipeline partners  a public entity  was formed in february and has incurred those costs normally associated with public entities which also served to increase non direct expenses 
fiscal also includes a full twelve months of costs associated with viking resources 
finally  certain allocations changed such that more costs are allocated to non direct expense rather than being allocated to another energy function such as production  drilling  well services or well operations 
depletion of oil and gas property costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the variance from period to period is directly attributable to changes in our oil and gas reserve quantities  product prices and fluctuations in the depletable cost basis of our gas and oil properties 
results of operations real estate finance during fiscal  we continued to focus on managing our existing portfolio of real estate loans rather than on acquiring new real estate loans 
although we sold five portfolio loans and acquired senior lien interests in each of two loans in which we had previously held only subordinate interests  the transactions were primarily directed at simplifying our loan portfolio and improving our lien seniority 
the transactions decreased our portfolio from loans to loans  while increasing our portfolio book value from million to million 
the following table sets forth information relating to the revenues recognized and costs and expenses incurred in our real estate finance operations during the periods indicated years ended september  in thousands revenues interest    accreted discount net of collection of interest    gains on sales of senior lien interests and loans    net rental and fee income  cost and expenses    year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate finance operations decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to the following o a decrease of million in interest income resulting from the following the repayment of two loans by two borrowers  one in october and one in july of approximately million which decreased interest income by million during fiscal compared to fiscal the sale of six loans  one in december  one in june  one in march  two in june and one in july  which decreased interest income by  during fiscal compared to fiscal the completion of accretion of discount in fiscal on eight loans as to which million in accretion had been taken in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  which decreased interest income by  these decreases were offset by an increase of million in accretion of discount on eight loans in fiscal compared to fiscal o a decrease of  in net rental and fee income during fiscal  to  from  in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from the following an increase of  in a non cash loss on one real estate venture 
the loss resulted from depreciation and other non cash charges allocated to our interest in an investment we account for on the equity method 
a decrease of  in service fees 
this decrease was partially offset by a one time service fee of  received from a real estate venture in which we own a interest  an increase of  in rental income from another real estate venture and income of  associated with another joint venture which we account for using the equity method 
o an increase of  in gains on sales of loans from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  resulting primarily from the following the sale of five loans in fiscal having book values totaling million for million  resulting in gains of million as compared to the sale of three loans in fiscal having book values totaling million for million  resulting in gains of million 
the repayment of two loans in fiscal  having aggregate book values of  for  resulting in gains of  as compared to the repayment of four loans in fiscal having aggregate book values of  for  resulting in gains of  costs and expenses of our real estate finance operations decreased million to million in the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to of a reduction in staff resulting from our decision in fiscal to concentrate our real estate finance activities on managing our existing loan portfolio 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenues from our real estate finance operations decreased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to the following o a decrease of million in interest income resulting from the following the repayment of a loan in june which decreased interest income by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the repayment by a borrower in october of approximately million of another loan  which decreased interest income by million during fiscal as compared to fiscal three additional loans were repaid during fiscal resulting in a decrease in interest income of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the completion of accretion of discount in fiscal on five loans as to which million accretion had been taken in fiscal o a decrease of million in net rental and fee income during fiscal  to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from one time fees of million and million earned in fiscal for services rendered to property owners in connection with the operation  leasing and supervision of the collateral securing two of our portfolio loans 
we earned no comparable fees during fiscal in addition  we experienced a non cash loss on one rental real estate venture of approximately  in fiscal  attributable to accounting for the investment on the equity method 
o a decrease of million in gains on sales of senior lien interests and loans due to a decrease in the number of loans sold 
prior to january   we structured most of our transactions in which senior lien interests were created to meet the criteria under generally accepted accounting principles for sales of those interests to the senior lienors 
effective january   we made a strategic decision to structure future transactions as financings rather than as sales 
thus  for most transactions that were completed prior to january   we recorded a gain on sale which we included in our revenues  refinancing proceeds received subsequent to that date  although included in our cash flow  are not recordable as revenues under generally accepted accounting principles 
this policy change resulted in a shift from the recognition of an immediate gain upon the sale of a senior lien interest in a loan receivable to the recognition of interest income over the life of the loan receivable 
however  during fiscal  we sold three loans and were partially repaid on a fourth loan  resulting in gains of million 
costs and expenses of our real estate finance operations increased  to million in the year ended september  we attribute the increase primarily to the increase in professional fees 
results of operations other revenues  costs and expenses year ended september  compared to year ended september  our interest and other income was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal primarily resulted from a decrease in interest income of million most of which was attributable to our discontinued leasing subsidiary 
dividend income increased  primarily as a result of our additional investment in rait in fiscal other expenses  which are netted in this line item  decreased  in fiscal due to certain non recurring charges in the prior year 
our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from decreases in pension expense and salary and benefits million as we redeployed certain personnel and their related payroll costs to energy operations from general and administrative 
our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from an increase in the depletable basis of our oil and gas properties due to the additional capitalized costs associated with drilling and acquisitions in fiscal our interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from our ongoing repurchase of our senior notes during fiscal  which reduced interest by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  a reduction in borrowings and lower rates received by our energy operations on funds borrowed decreased interest by million in fiscal and these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest expense in our real estate operations due to increased borrowings 
we own of the limited partnership interest in atlas pipeline through subordinated units we received at the closing of the offering of atlas pipeline s common units to the public and the sale of our gathering systems to atlas pipeline 
the minority interest in atlas pipeline is the interest of atlas pipeline s common unitholders 
because we own more than of atlas pipeline  it is included in our consolidated financial statements and the ownership by the public is shown as a minority interest 
the minority interest in atlas pipeline s earnings was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was the result of an increase in atlas pipeline s net income and the effect of a full year of operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal in which operations commenced on january  our equity in the loss of an unconsolidated affiliate represents of the net loss of optiron corporation  an energy technology company formed in fiscal our provision for possible losses was  in fiscal  a net decrease of   resulting primarily from the following o in energy  we recorded a provision for possible losses against receivables in the amount of  associated with the chapter bankruptcy filing of an energy customer during the current fiscal year 
o in real estate  we recorded a provision on one loan in the amount of  in fiscal  which we subsequently sold in fiscal our effective tax rate increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  as a result of an increase in pre tax earnings coupled with a consistent level of permanent differences between book and taxable income 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  our interest and other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal primarily resulted from intercompany interest on increased lending to our discontinued small ticket equipment leasing subsidiary million 
also  as a result of a substantial increase in our uncommitted cash balances from the sale of our equipment leasing operations  and the temporary investment of such balances  interest income increased by  our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase primarily resulted from increases in pension costs million  occupancy costs  insurance and taxes  and personnel costs our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from depletion million and amortization and depreciation million associated with the acquisition of viking resources 
our interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from the repayment of one loan in october and lower average borrowings on our credit facilities partially offset by higher interest rates as compared to fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  because of the sale of our equipment leasing operation and the re emphasis of our energy operations  both our president and our vice chairman of the board  who was also president of our commercial real estate finance business  were separated from the company 
both officers were parties to employment agreements and were separated in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
accordingly  continuing results of operations were charged million and discontinued operations were charged million 
the minority interest in atlas pipeline represents of the net earnings of atlas pipeline as a result of the sale in february of our natural gas gathering operations to atlas pipeline 
because we own more than of atlas pipeline it is included in our consolidated financial statements and the ownership by the public is shown as a minority interest 
our equity in the loss of an unconsolidated affiliate represents of the net loss of optiron and its predecessor  and a provision for possible losses of  against advances made to this affiliate 
our provision for possible losses increased to  in fiscal  an increase of  from  in fiscal this increase primarily resulted from an increase to the provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal caused by the partial write down of one loan in the amount of  during that quarter 
our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  as a result of a reduction in pre tax earnings  coupled with a consistent level of permanent differences between book and taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources following the sale of our equipment leasing operations  our major sources of liquidity have been the proceeds of that sale  funds generated by operations  and borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we have employed these funds principally in the expansion of our energy operations  the repurchase of our senior notes and common stock and the acquisition of two senior lien interests in loans in which we held junior positions 
the following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the years ended september   and years ended september  in thousands provided by operations    used in provided by investing activities    used in provided by financing activities    provided by used in discontinued operations    decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents    year ended september  compared to year ended september  we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  as compared to million at september  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in the fiscal year ended september  as compared to to in the fiscal year ended september  cash provided by our operating activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following o energy operating net income  including minority interest  increased cash flow by million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a increase in the average price we received for our natural gas 
o collections of interest decreased cash flow by million in fiscal  primarily due to the repayment of accrued interest upon borrower refinancings of two loans in fiscal o changes in the amount of our accounts receivable and accounts payable and other liabilities increased cash flow by million in fiscal o interest income decreased million in fiscal primarily as a result of interest income received in fiscal from our discontinued leasing subsidiary 
cash used in our investing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the following o the receipt in fiscal of million from the sale of our equipment leasing operations

oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during fiscal  the company received an average of per mcf of gas and per barrel of oil after hedging 
prices for both gas and oil have dropped substantially since september  although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation has not normally had a significantly effect on us 
however  industry specific pressure could increase over time due to favorable conditions in the industry 
dividends in the years ended september   and  we paid dividends of million  million and million  respectively 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends since august the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  is in the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on the various factors affecting our financial condition and other matters the board of directors deems relevant  including restrictions which may be imposed pursuant to the indenture under which our senior notes were issued 
environmental regulation a continuing trend to greater environmental and safety awareness and increasing environmental regulation has generally resulted in higher operating costs for the oil and gas industry 
we monitor environmental and safety laws and believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  however  compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
we cannot offer you any assurance that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not  in the future  materially adversely affect our operations through increased costs of doing business or restrictions on the manner in which we conduct our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and oil and gas prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
general 
during the fiscal year ended september   our investments in real estate loans did not undergo material change other than changes resulting from normally recurring debt service payments received except for the sale of five loans having book values totaling million and the purchase of senior positions in two loans in which we held junior positions at a cost of million 
our long term debt generally did not undergo material change other than changes resulting from normally recurring debt service payments 
we entered into a million term loan facility secured by certain mortgage loans  as discussed in real estate finance assets 
energy 
at september   the amount outstanding under a revolving loan attributable to our energy operations increased to million from million at september  the weighted average interest rate for this facility decreased from at september  to at september   due to a decrease in market index rates used to calculate the facility s interest rates 
in october  a million revolving credit facility was obtained to fund the expansion of atlas pipeline s existing gathering systems and the acquisitions of other gas gathering systems 
in the nine months ended september   million was drawn under this facility to fund two acquisitions of gas gathering systems and to fund certain capital expenditures 
this balance is outstanding as of september  at the borrower s option  the facility bears interest at either the lending institution s prime rate plus basis points or the euro rate  which is defined as an average of specified london interbank offered rate libor rates plus to basis points  depending upon atlas leverage ratio 
at september   the weighted average interest rate was 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure in commodities is the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to us natural gas production 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
we periodically enter into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected gas production 
these financial hedging activities are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of these hedges are recognized in gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the market when the commodity is delivered 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 

as of september   we had gas hedges in place covering  dekatherm maturing through january the fair value of these hedges  at september  is included on our balance sheet and represents the estimated amount that would have been realized had the hedges been terminated on that date 
as these contracts qualify and have been designated as cash flow hedges  gains and losses on them resulting from market price changes are determined monthly and reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month in which the hedged production is sold 
at that time the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the sold production is closed to production revenues 
gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on nymex 
net losses relating to these hedging contracts in fiscal and were  and  respectively  and a gain of  was realized in fiscal real estate finance assets the following table sets forth information regarding of the loans held in our portfolio as of september  the presentation  for each category of information  aggregates the loans by their maturity dates for maturities occurring in each of the fiscal years through and separately aggregates the information for all maturities arising after the fiscal year 
we do not believe that these loans are sensitive to changes in interest rates since o the loans are subject to forbearance or other agreements that require all of the operating cash flow from the properties underlying the loans  after debt service on senior lien interests  to be paid to us and thus are not currently being paid based on the stated interest rates of the loans  o all senior lien interests are at fixed rates and are thus not subject to interest rate fluctuation that would affect payments to us  and o each loan has significant accrued and unpaid interest and other charges outstanding to which cash flow from the underlying property would be applied even if cash flow were to exceed the interest rate  as originally underwritten

we continue to forbear from exercising our remedies with respect to these loans since we receive all of the economic benefit from the properties without having to incur the expense of foreclosure
