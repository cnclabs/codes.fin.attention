item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading market maker in nasdaq securities  other otc equity securities  and the over the counter market for nyse and amex listed equity securities 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  knight securities  ks  we make markets in approximately  equity securities in nasdaq and on the nasd s otc bulletin board 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  knight capital markets kcm  we make markets in the over the counter market for all nyse and amex listed equity securities 
we are also a leading market maker in options on individual equities  equity indices and fixed income instruments in the us and europe through our knight financial products kfp subsidiary 
we also maintain an asset management business for institutional investors and high net worth individuals through our deephaven subsidiaries 
the company has two reportable business segments securities market making and asset management 
securities market making primarily includes the operations of ks  kcm and kfp and includes market making in equity securities listed on nasdaq  on the otcbb of the nasd  in the over the counter market for nyse and amex listed securities and in options on individual equities  equity indices  fixed income instruments and certain commodities 
the asset management segment includes the operations of deephaven capital management  deephaven capital and deephaven investment advisers and consists of investment management and sponsorship for a series of private investment funds 
ks commenced nasdaq and otc securities market making operations on july  based on rankings published by the autex group  ks was ranked first in autex s nasdaq otc securities rankings during ks s equity share volume totaled billion  billion and billion  or  and of our total equity share volume  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since commencing operations in  ks s business has grown rapidly and accounted for  and of our total equity share volume growth during the years ended december   and  respectively 
since our acquisition of kcm in march  kcm has also experienced significant increases in equity share volume 
in addition  kcm has held the market share ranking in trading of securities in the over the counter market for nyse and amex listed securities for over two years as disclosed by the nasd 
kcm s equity share volume totaled billion  billion and billion  or  and of our total equity share volume for the years ended december   and  respectively 
kfp commenced its options market making and specialist business in kfp s us option contract volume amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors  including the value of our securities positions and our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our market making activities  volatility in the securities markets  our ability to manage personnel and expenses  the amount of revenue derived from limit orders as a percentage of net trading revenues  changes in payments for order flow or clearing costs  the addition or loss of sales and trading professionals  regulatory changes  the amount and timing of capital expenditures  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and general market conditions 
if demand for our market making services declines and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  significant seasonality in our business 
due to all of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past  that we will be able to improve our operating results or that we will be able to sustain our profitability on an annual and or quarterly basis 
revenues our revenues consist principally of net trading revenue from securities market making activities 
net trading revenue  which represents trading gains net of trading losses  is primarily affected by changes in equity trade and share volumes and option contract volumes  our ability to derive trading gains by taking proprietary positions  changes in our execution standards  volatility in the marketplace and by regulatory changes and evolving industry customs and practices 
our net trading revenue per trade for otc securities has historically exceeded the net trading revenue per trade for listed securities 
we continue to focus on increasing our institutional business 
otc securities transactions with institutional customers are executed as principal  and all related profits and losses are included within net trading revenue 
listed securities transactions with institutional customers are executed on an agency basis  for which we earn commissions on a per share basis 
we also receive fees for providing certain information to market data providers and for directing trades to certain destinations for execution 
commissions and fees are primarily affected by changes in our trade and share volumes in listed securities 
asset management fees represent fees earned for sponsoring and managing the investments of private investment funds 
asset management fees are primarily affected by the rates of return earned on the funds we manage and changes in the amount of assets under management 
we earn interest income from our cash held at banks and cash held in trading accounts at clearing brokers  net of transaction related interest charged by clearing brokers for facilitating the settlement and financing of securities transactions  and interest on subordinated notes and short term debt 
net interest is primarily affected by the changes in cash balances held at banks and clearing brokers  the level of securities positions  and the principal amount outstanding under subordinated notes and short term debt 
expenses our operating expenses largely consist of employee compensation and benefits  payments for order flow and execution and clearance fees 
a substantial portion of these expenses is variable in nature 
employee compensation and benefits expense  which is largely profitability based  fluctuates  for the most part  based on changes in net trading revenue and our profitability 
payments for order flow fluctuate based on equity share volume  the mix of market orders and limit orders and the mix of orders received from broker dealers who accept payments for order flow 
execution and clearance fees fluctuate primarily based on changes in equity trade and share volume  the mix of trades of otc securities compared to listed securities  clearance fees charged by clearing brokers and ecn fees 
our international expansion efforts have generally increased our operating expenses 
employee compensation and benefits expense primarily consists of salaries and wages paid to administrative and customer service personnel and profitability based compensation  which includes compensation and benefits paid to market making and sales personnel based on their individual performance  and incentive compensation paid to all other employees based on our overall profitability 
profitability based compensation represented  and of total employee compensation and benefits expense for the years ended december   and respectively 
we have grown from employees at december  to and  employees as of december  and  respectively 
approximately of our employees are directly involved in market making  sales or customer service activities 
compensation for employees engaged in market making and sales activities  the largest component of employee compensation and benefits  is determined primarily based on a percentage of gross trading profits net of expenses including payments for order flow  execution and clearance costs and overhead allocations 
payments for order flow represent customary payments to broker dealers  in the normal course of business  for directing their order flow in equity securities to us 
as a result of the new order handling rules implemented by the sec in  we changed our order flow payment policy from paying broker dealers for substantially all order executions  to paying broker dealers only for orders which provide us with a profit opportunity 
for example  we make payments on market orders  but do not pay on limit orders 
payments for order flow change as we modify our payment formulas and as our percentage of customers whose policy is not to accept payments for order flow varies 
execution and clearance fees primarily represent clearance fees paid to clearing brokers for otc and listed securities  transaction fees paid to nasdaq  payments made to third parties for exchange seat leases and execution fees paid to third parties  primarily for executing trades in listed securities on the nyse and amex and for executing orders through electronic communications networks  commonly referred to as ecns 
due to our significant equity share and trade volume  we have been able to negotiate favorable rates and volume discounts from clearing brokers and providers of execution services 
as a result of these lower rates and discounts and the increase in equity trade volume of otc securities as a percentage of total trade volume  execution and clearance fees per trade have decreased 
communications and data processing expense primarily consists of costs for obtaining stock market data and telecommunications services 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of goodwill  which includes contingent consideration primarily resulting from the acquisition of the listed securities market making businesses of kcm and tradetech securities  lp tradetech depreciation and amortization expense also includes the amortization of goodwill related to our purchases of various options related businesses 
professional fees primarily consist of fees paid to computer programming and systems consultants  as well as legal fees and other professional fees 
occupancy and equipment rentals expense primarily consists of rental payments on office and equipment leases 
business development expense primarily consists of advertising costs and marketing expenses  including travel and entertainment expenses and promotion costs 
interest on preferred units represents required interest payments on our mandatorily redeemable preferred a and b units at a rate approximating the federal funds rate 
on april   we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding preferred a units for million in cash 
on april   we redeemed million of preferred b units and  on july   we used million of the proceeds from our initial public offering to redeem all of the remaining outstanding preferred b units 
merger related expenses primarily consist of investment banking  legal and accounting costs incurred in connection with our merger with arbitrade holdings llc this transaction closed in january other expenses primarily consist of administrative expenses and other operating costs 
income tax prior to our initial public offering  we were a limited liability company and were not subject to federal or state income taxes 
actual income tax expense represents income taxes incurred from july   the date of the reorganization  through december  and for the years ended december  and this period is referred to as the post offering period 
additionally  prior to the merger with kfp  kfp was a limited liability company  which was treated as a partnership for tax purposes and its us federal and state income taxes were borne by kfp s individual partners 
as such kfp s historical financial statements only include a provision for non us income taxes 
subsequent to the merger  kfp s income is subject to federal income taxes and state income taxes 
this period is referred to as the post merger period 
our effective tax rate for the post offering period and post merger period and proforma effective tax rate for all periods prior to the post offering period and post merger period  differ from the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes  as well as nondeductible expenses  including the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of trimark and a portion of business development expenses and merger related expenses

these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility or changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control

we monitor our risks by a constant review of trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals  appropriate risk measures and real time profits and losses 
the management of trading positions is enhanced by review of mark to market valuations and position summaries on a daily basis

      beginning in the fourth quarter of and throughout and  there has been a sharp increase in the price volatility of many stocks  particularly of technology companies and companies that sell products or services via the internet 
this volatility has been coupled with record trading volume in many of these stocks  which are primarily listed on nasdaq 
customers eager to trade internet and technology stocks have flooded their brokers and  consequently  market makers such as us with larger numbers of orders  leading to large order imbalances  systems queues and backlogs 
during these extreme market conditions  many firms have implemented procedures that are designed to preserve the continuous execution of customers orders while also lessening the exposure of the firm to extraordinary market risk 
in the fourth quarter of  we modified our execution policies in response to these changes in the marketplace 
our current policy is to provide continuous automatic execution on orders of up to  shares for investors in over  nasdaq stocks under normal market conditions 
we reserve the right at our sole discretion to reduce  modify  suspend or cancel any of our guaranteed or automated order handling protocols  including automated price improvement and automatic execution  without prior notice on a stock by stock or client by client basis  when periods of extreme or unusual market conditions exist  risk management protocols so dictate  attempts are made to circumvent our automated execution size limitations  or we otherwise deem it appropriate 
in the normal course of our options market making business  we maintain inventories of options  futures and equities 
our main exposures are from equity price and volatility risk 
we manage these exposures by constantly monitoring and diversifying our exposures and position sizes and establishing offsetting hedges 
our market making staff and trading room managers continuously manage our positions and our risk exposures 
our systems incorporate trades and update our risk profile using options pricing models on a real time basis 
our proprietary options risk management system allows us to stress test our portfolio on a real time basis 
on a daily basis  risk reports are distributed to senior management and the firm s risk managers who incorporate this information in our daily market making decisions 
these reports identify potential exposures in terms of options and futures on individual securities and index contracts  organized in different ways such as industry sectors  under extreme price and volatility movements 
at december   movements in volatility and stock prices on our entire equity options and equity index option portfolios  which contain the majority of our market risk  would have resulted in approximately the following gains losses in our options market making portfolio options market making change in stock prices none change in volatility million million million none million million million million million for working capital purposes  we invest in money market funds  commercial paper  government securities or maintain interest bearing balances in our trading accounts with clearing brokers  which are classified as cash equivalents and receivable from clearing brokers  respectively  in the consolidated statements of financial condition
