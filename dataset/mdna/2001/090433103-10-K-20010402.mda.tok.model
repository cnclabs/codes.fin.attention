the impact of the securitization on bingham s finances and results of operations will be included in bingham s quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending march  bingham s future liquidity and capital requirements depend on numerous factors  many of which are outside of its control 
bingham currently anticipates that it will have sufficient working capital to meet its anticipated needs for the next twelve months through a combination of funds from operations  including loan sales and securitizations  proceeds from its existing credit facilities and a renewed repurchase facility with lehman or replacement repurchase facility with a different lender and proceeds from the sale of assets or debt or equity securities 
bingham expects to meet its long term capital requirements through a merger or joint venture with another entity or through the sale of debt or equity securities 
see factors that may affect our future results we may not have sufficient working capital to meet our anticipated needs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
in the normal course of business  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk and legal risk and are not included in the following table 
the following table shows the company s expected maturity dates of its assets and liabilities 
for each maturity category in the table the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities reflects an imbalance between repricing opportunities for the two sides of the balance sheet 
the consequences of a negative cumulative gap at the end of one year suggests that  if interest rates were to rise  liability costs would increase more quickly than asset yields  placing negative pressure on earnings

management intends that its loans receivable will be securitized or sold prior to the end of fiscal proceeds from securitizations or sales would be used to pay down corresponding debt 
if the company were unable to securitize or sell loans it would be necessary to renegotiate its funding sources described in note g to the consolidated financial statements or find alternative funding sources 
the company may manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of us treasury securities  treasury security rate locks and forward interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the fixed rate loans in the commercial and manufactured home loan portfolio 
the company may use these instruments in an attempt to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
as of december  the company s hedging instruments consisted entirely of interest rate swaps as described in note n to the consolidated financial statements 
a forward interest rate swap is an obligation to enter into a swap or cash settlement on a future date for the difference between the market rate on that date and an agreed upon swap rate 
this transaction is similar to a treasury rate lock in that it allows you to lock in a rate starting in the future 
the difference is that you will be locking in a future swap rate  not a forward treasury yield 
a forward interest rate swap allows the positive or negative effect of a change in the value of the underlying loans to be offset by the positive or negative payment on the settlement of the hedging transaction 
if interest rates rise the value of the loan portfolio will have decreased but the decrease will be offset by an increase in the value of the hedge equal to approximately the present value of the decrease in value of the hedged loan portfolio 
if interest rates are declining the reverse would hold true  the value of the loan portfolio will increase and be offset by a decrease in the value of the swap approximately equal to the present value of the hedged loan portfolio increase
