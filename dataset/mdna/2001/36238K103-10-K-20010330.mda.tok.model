provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the provisions of sab no 
retroactive to january  sab no 
clarifies the appropriate timing of revenue recognition when products are shipped to customers

is to generally defer the recognition of revenue from two to seven days as compared to the company s previous method 
the company implemented the guidance set forth in sab no 
by recording an adjustment for the cumulative effect of adoption of  on january  the emerging issues task force eitf has issued eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
consistent with the requirements under sab no

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company determined that adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material affect on its financial statements 
effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
however  if inflation increases in the future it could temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also impact the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the microcomputer and workstation industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading microcomputer and workstation hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results
