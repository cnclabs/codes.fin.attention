health card derives its revenue from the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services to sponsors of prescription benefit plans 
substantially all of the services health card provides to its sponsors are related to the adjudication of the drug claims at the point of service 
health card also recognizes administrative fees at the time of claims adjudication 
revenue is earned and recognized as follows administrative fees are agreed upon with the sponsor on either a per claim charge or a per plan participant per month charge 
per claim fees are billed to sponsors for the claims adjudicated during the period 
per plan participant per month fees are generally billed to sponsors at the beginning of the month 
the amount of revenue related to the drugs dispensed by pharmacies participating in health card s pharmacy network is recognized at the time of dispensing the drug as the cost is incurred 
the amount of revenue recognized is reduced by the amount of rebates that health card shares with its sponsors 
the following table sets forth the breakdown of health card s charges relating to pharmaceuticals dispensed and administrative fees years ended june  charges relating to pharmaceuticals    administrative fees and other    total revenues    health card does not take possession or legal ownership of the pharmaceutical drugs dispensed by the pharmacy network  although health card assumes the legal responsibility and financial risk of paying for dispensed pharmaceuticals whether or not health card is paid by its sponsors  unless it states otherwise in health card s contracts with individual pharmacies and or chains 
all of health card s new pharmacy contracts specify that the pharmacies will not be paid if health card is not paid by its sponsors 
health card utilizes its comprehensive pharmacy benefit database to perform outcome studies and to develop disease information programs which are used to reduce overall healthcare costs 
these programs currently produce a small amount of revenue 
health card believes that these value added information based services are becoming a more important component of managed care  and therefore these services may provide an increasing source of revenue for health card in the future 
cost of claims includes the amounts paid to network pharmacies  including mail service pharmacies  for pharmaceutical claims  and reductions resulting from the gross rebates received from drug manufacturers 
cost of claims are recognized as follows the contractual obligation of health card to pay for these drugs is recorded as cost of claims at the time of dispensing of the drug by the pharmacy network 
cost of claims is reduced by the rebates that health card receives 
rebates are earned from drug manufacturers based on drugs utilized by plan participants at the time of dispensing 
health card s portion of these rebates  which varies by sponsor  is recorded monthly based upon the claims adjudicated in that month 
health card processes its rebate claims either direct with the drug manufacturers  through its wholly owned subsidiary  specialty  or through a third party rebate administrator 
during the fiscal year ended june   health card dealt with three different rebate administrators 
effective july   health card has entered into an agreement with the administrator to handle all of its consolidated rebate claims which it does not otherwise submit direct to the drug manufacturers 
the amount of rebates recognized as reductions to revenue or cost of claims is based on estimates tied to actual claims data 
the third party administrators provide estimates to health card based on their analysis of the amount of rebates that health card s claims should generate 
these estimates are prepared based on estimates of how health card s claims might influence the market share of a particular drug covered under an agreement with a drug manufacturer 
market share is generally defined as the percentage of utilization of a certain drug or drugs within its therapeutic class 
under health card s contract with its previous rebate administratior which terminated june   and its new contract with the administrator  health card receives a specified amount per claim 
therefore once the total number of claims is known  then the total amount of rebates to be received will be known 
these amounts are paid within days after the end of a quarter 
health card computes the amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data  the criteria established in each individual contract  and the specified payment schedules 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse health card for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
manufacturer rebates have historically had a significant impact on health card s financial performance as the following table shows years ended june  rebates as a of cost of claims of total gross profit of income before taxes due to the expected continued growth and diversification of health card s business  health card also expects rebates as a percentage of cost of claims  to increase and continue to account for a significant percentage of total gross profit and income before taxes 
certain of health card s sponsors are entitled to all or a portion of rebates received by health card  which portion varies by sponsor 
if such rebate programs were to be discontinued or adversely altered by drug manufacturers  or if the terms of health card s rebate sharing arrangements with its sponsors were adversely altered  it would have a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
due to changing market conditions and competition  it is possible that the percentage of rebates retained by health card based on its arrangements with its sponsors may change when these arrangements expire and may be lower in arrangements with new sponsors 
any such change in the percentage of rebates retained and recorded as a reduction of revenue could have a material adverse effect on health card s business  operating results and financial condition 
credit risk relating to the rebates receivable is evaluated based on the financial strength of the rebate administrator and the drug manufacturers 
health card believes that most of the drug manufacturers are fortune companies 
health card does not believe a credit risk reserve is necessary 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on health card s gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  health card expects this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
health card plans to continue its internal growth through increased marketing of its services and by expanding the range of services offered  particularly to include value added consulting and information based services which health card believes to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  health card intends to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement its internal growth by making acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management service providers  as well as related services providers 
public offering on august   health card completed the sale of  shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering the public offering 
pursuant to the public offering  health card received net proceeds of approximately  concurrently  the bert e 
brodsky revocable trust the brodsky trust sold  shares of common stock of health card in an underwritten offering 
of the proceeds received by the brodsky trust  it used approximately  to partly repay certain indebtedness owed by certain affiliates of the brodsky trust to health card

results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  of the increase  million  or was due to the inclusion of revenues from pai  subsequent to july   and pmp  subsequent to march  million of the increase was due to revenues related to new sponsors or new services offered 
the majority of the balance of the year over year increase  or approximately million  was due primarily to increased revenues from other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
both periods were negatively impacted by a net reduction in revenues that arose when the company settled certain fees due from a major sponsor related to a capitation arrangement for calendar years the net reduction in revenues was  for the fiscal year ended june   and  for the fiscal year ended june  the calendar year and contract with this sponsor is no longer a capitation arrangement 
revenues for both the fiscal years were adjusted based on eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives coupons  rebates and discounts 
the financial impact of this is to reduce revenues by the amount of rebates to be paid to sponsors and reduce cost of claims by the gross amount of rebates received by the company 
previously the net difference between the gross amount received by the company and the amount paid to sponsors was treated as a reduction in cost of claims with no change to revenue 
the impact of this change was to reduce revenue and cost of claims by million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june   to million for the fiscal year ended june  pai and pmp accounted for million  or of the increase 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the percentage for the fiscal year ended june  was favorably impacted by a  reduction in rebates payable  which reduced cost of claims  which arose when the company reevaluated its liabilities to a plan sponsor 
the effect of this reduction is unrelated to the reduction in revenues and cost of claims described in the preceding paragraph 
gross profit increased from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   an million  or  increase 
pai and pmp accounted for million  or  of the increase 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the decline is partially attributable to the impact of the one time adjustment  described in the explanation for the change in cost of claims above 
the company has also seen a decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the increase  or million  was related to the inclusion of pai and pmp in the consolidated numbers 
the balance of the growth in these expenses was principally related to five areas i an approximate  increase in expenditures related to increases in compensation and benefits  primarily associated with new employees including senior management  ii an approximate  increase in depreciation and amortization expenses related to increased hardware procurement and software development  iii an approximate  increase in data processing charges related to increased information technology services  iv an aggregate of approximately  related to actual payments made and or reserves accrued related to the following matters a the settlement of the west contra costa lawsuit see item  legal proceedings  b the reconciliation and settlement of amounts due to a former major sponsor see note to the consolidated financial statements  and c the settlement of the allcare patent infringement see item legal proceedings  and v an approximate  increase in legal fees related primarily to the defense of the items discussed in iv above 
general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates increased approximately  or  year over year from  to  for the fiscal year ended june  and june   respectively 
the majority of the increase related to additional rent related to additional space taken in fiscal year  increased information technology services  and additional administrative support services and supplies to support the continued expansion of the business 
other income  net  declined by approximately  or  from  in the fiscal year ended june   to  in the fiscal year ended june  the main factor in the decline was an approximate  increase in interest expense  primarily related to the fact that the company entered into a capital lease agreement with hewlett packard for computer hardware and related software that went into effect in march the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an approximate  increase in interest income related to increased cash flow due to the inclusion of pai  pmp and spc 
income before income taxes declined approximately  or  from approximately  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reasons for the decline were the one time adjustments noted above i the  revenue reduction in the fiscal year ended june   ii the  payments accrued reserve for settlements in the fiscal year ended june   and iii the  reduction in rebates payable in the fiscal year ended june  while income before income taxes declined year over year  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for these same periods actually increased by approximately  or  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  this was due to the inclusion of approximately  of goodwill amortization related to the pai and pmp acquisitions in the period ended june   approximately  of depreciation of pai s and pmp s assets during this same year  as well as approximately  of incremental depreciation and amortization of new assets procured and capitalized during the year ended june  these increases offset the approximate  decline in operating income year over year 
there were a total of four negative adjustments reflected in the company s financial performance during the fiscal year ended june   related to settlements with sponsors and or lawsuits 
these settlements  which are described above and in item legal proceedings  and which relate to prior fiscal years  reduced income before income taxes by approximately  of this total   was actually paid out during the fiscal year  with the balance to be paid during the fiscal year ended june  the company is not currently aware of any other issues that might require a settlement 
the company believes its bad debt reserves and other reserves should be sufficient based on current information 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease stemmed primarily from a lower effective state tax rate net of federal taxes 
fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  revenues increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase related to revenues from new sponsors during the fiscal year was approximately million 
the majority of the remaining increase of approximately million was due to other existing sponsors as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth  and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
the remainder of the increase  approximately  was due to new services offered during the year around the e pharmacy and clinical services 
revenues for both the fiscal years were adjusted based on eitf  accounting for certain sales incentives coupons  rebates and discounts 
the financial impact of this is to reduce revenues by the amount of rebates to be paid to sponsors and reduce cost of claims by the gross amount of rebates received by the company 
previously the net difference between the gross amount received by the company and the amount paid to sponsors was treated as a reduction in cost of claims with no change to revenue 
the impact of this change was to reduce revenue and cost of claims by million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
revenues grew year over year despite the loss of two key clients during the june  fiscal year 
one  a previous significant sponsor  terminated its contract with health card as of january  the second was placed in receivership by the state of florida as of january   and their members were dispersed to other plans not covered by health card 
these two sponsors accounted for million and million in revenues during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the revenue from these two sponsors was replaced by the million of revenue from new sponsors described above 
this helped to mitigate the overall impact of their loss on an actual run rate basis 
two other factors influencing the year to year comparison were revenues of the fiscal year ended june  included a one time rate increase of  from a major sponsor  and the revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was net of an  reduction in revenue when health card settled certain fees from a major sponsor as consideration for a new two year arrangement with this sponsor 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  cost of claims increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the primary reason for the cost of claims increasing as a percentage of revenue has to do with a risk sharing arrangement health card had with a major sponsor 
during the fiscal year ended june  the cost of drugs covered under this arrangement were greater than the agreed upon capitated rate  which led to a sharing of those costs between health card and the sponsor 
this fact along with the  revenue reduction mentioned above led to a differential between revenue and cost under this contract of million during fiscal this risk sharing arrangement is no longer in effect 
partially offsetting this increase in costs was a  increase in the amount of manufacturer rebates received due to the increased volume of claims in fiscal and the administrative fee to be paid to specialty 
see business services claims management rebate administration 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june  rebates payable were reduced by  when health card reevaluated its liability to a plan sponsor 
cost of claims for the fiscal year was decreased by the same amount 
gross profit increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of the increase in revenues  offset by the increase in cost of claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses  which include amounts charged by affiliates  increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  million of the increase resulted from increases in compensation  benefits  rent  sales and marketing and other expenses related to the continued expansion of health card s business 
the majority of the compensation and benefits increase is related to approximately twenty additional employees at june  compared to june  depreciation and amortization expenses also increased by approximately  as a function of increased hardware procurement and software development as health card continues to enhance its information technology capabilities 
health card also evaluated its receivables due from certain sponsors  including a key sponsor currently in receivership  as described above  and determined it should increase its reserves and or write off some balances 
the impact on health card was an incremental  in bad debt expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal this accounted for the majority of the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
while selling  general and administrative expenses increased year over year in an absolute amount  they grew at a slower rate than the increase in revenue 
these expenses as a percentage of revenue actually declined from in fiscal year to in fiscal year general and administrative expenses charged by affiliates increased  or approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june   primarily as a result of increased information technology services and rent to support the business 
other income increased approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  the net increase to income was due to an increase in interest income of  earned on increased cash from the public offering and an  decrease in offering costs 
this addition to income was partially offset by an  increase in interest expense from a capital lease for computer hardware 
the provision for income taxes increased approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  the provision for the fiscal year ended june  was reduced by the utilization of a  net operating loss carryforward 
there is no remaining net operating loss carryforward to the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades and the funding of accounts receivable 
the company also requires cash for potential acquisitions of other pharmacy benefit management companies or of companies providing related services 
as of june   the company had a working capital deficit of million as compared to working capital of million as of june  the primary reasons for the change in working capital were the acquisitions of pai and pmp 
the company utilized million of cash and cash equivalents  net of cash received  to acquire these companies during the fiscal year ended june  these funds came from the company s working capital  thus a long term asset  goodwill  was acquired with a short term asset  cash 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended june   accounts payable increased by million more than accounts receivable  thus providing cash 
for the fiscal year ended june   accounts payable increased by more than accounts receivable as well  but only by million 
there was also million of non cash depreciation and amortization related to the acquisitions and increased fixed assets during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  historically  the timing of the company s accounts receivable and accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan sponsors on the one hand  and the company s pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to the company s payments to participating pharmacies being slower than its corresponding collections from plan sponsors 
the company believes that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expects to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  the company could require additional working capital financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if the company were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  the net cash outlay for pai was initially million  representing the initial payment of million plus million of related expenses  less pai s cash balance at july  of million 
the net cash outlay for pmp was million  representing the initial payment of million plus million of related expenses  less pmp s cash balance at march  of million 
in addition  there were million of capital asset additions during the period 
for the fiscal year ended june  there were million of capital asset additions  which was partially offset by the repayment of a note by the majority stockholder 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended june   reflecting repayments against capital leases 
this compares to million provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended june   reflecting the cash received from the public offering described herein 
during fiscal year  the company entered into three capital lease transactions for hardware and software 
the purchase price of these capital assets was  one hardware lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  another hardware lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  the software lease is for a term of months with monthly payments of  the principal balance of these three capital leases as of june  was  the company assumed all the assets and liabilities of pai  as of july   including two outstanding loans as follows i a note payable to regions bank with a principal balance as of june  of  such note is payable in monthly installments in the amount of  including interest at the rate of and principal through july repayment of such note is currently secured by a lien on and a security interest in an automobile  and ii a loan representing prepaid rebates from its rebate administrator with a principal balance as of june  of  payable with interest at the rate of in four quarterly payments of  commencing december  and ending september  pai stockholders were eligible to receive up to  in additional consideration payable in combination of cash and common stock if certain financial targets of pai were met for the fiscal year ended june  these targets have been achieved and the million has been earned 
 in cash was paid  and  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share were issued to the pai stockholders at the end of august  the pai stockholders are eligible to receive one more payment of up to million if certain financial targets of pai are met for the fiscal year ended june  in february  the company entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated party for computer software products and professional services 
the agreement required the company to pay an initial license fee 
in addition  if certain milestones are met based on the number of processed claims  as defined in the agreement  the initial license fee increases in specified increments 
to date  three such milestones have been met  resulting in a increase in the license fee 
the agreement also provides for the annual payment of a fee for maintenance and updating services equal to of the initial license fee  as defined 
it is anticipated that  based on internal growth and the pai and pmp acquisitions  at least one additional milestone will be met during calendar year if the two remaining milestones are reached  the cash outlay by the company would be  the company anticipates that current cash positions  after the pai and pmp acquisitions and the repayment of certain affiliate and shareholder debt  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of the company s stated goals to acquire other pharmacy benefit management companies  evidenced by the two acquired during the fiscal year ended june  this will require cash 
depending on the company s evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required 
therefore  the company has put in place a  revolving credit line for acquisitions with its bank 
the company has no current borrowings against this credit line 
the company is also currently negotiating a larger amount  based on anticipated future earnings and its balance sheet  to meet anticipated future needs 
in the event that the company s plans change or its assumptions prove to be inaccurate  or that the additional financing is not consummated  or the proceeds of the financing prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
other matters inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on health card s net income 
recent pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles  respectively 
fasb requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fasb  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of these pronouncements on its financial position and operations
