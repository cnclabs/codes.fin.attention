overview we are a leading global provider of customer driven internet application software products and services 
our e business solutions are designed to enable businesses to build successful and sustainable online businesses that are customer managed 
our customer driven internet applications and solutions allow businesses to create and manage internet business channels that are designed to attract  engage and retain their customers  partners  and suppliers online 
using our products content  integration  and analysis capabilities  our clients deploy applications  which are focused on personalized and mass customized interaction across multiple touchpoints and communication channels 
we were founded in december to date  we have developed and released several versions of our product and have sold our products and services to approximately  clients 
we market and sell our products worldwide primarily through our direct sales force but also market through third party providers 
we derive our revenue from the sale of software product licenses and from professional consulting  maintenance and support services 
product license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered  we have no remaining significant obligations with regard to implementation  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable 
product license revenue for arrangements to deliver unspecified additional software products in the future is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
services revenue consists of fees from professional services and from maintenance and telephone support 
professional services include integration of software  application development  training and software installation 
we bill professional services fees on a time and materials basis 
we recognize professional services fees billed on a time and materials basis as the services are performed 
our clients typically purchase maintenance agreements annually  and we price maintenance agreements based on a percentage of our current product list price 
we price telephone support based on differing levels of support 
clients purchasing maintenance agreements receive unspecified product upgrades and electronic  web based technical support  while purchasers of support contracts receive additional telephone support 
we recognize revenue from maintenance and support agreements ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically one year 
cost of revenue consists of costs to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation  as well as personnel and other expenses related to providing professional services 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales and marketing and professional services departments  and to establish an administrative organization 
as a result  we have incurred significant losses since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe our success depends on further increasing our client base and on continued growth in the e business solutions market 
accordingly  we intend to continue to invest in sales  marketing  professional services  research and development and in our operational and financial systems as necessary 
furthermore  we expect to continue to incur operating losses  excluding amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation and restructuring charges  at least through the first quarter of  and our expected increase in operating expenses will require significant increases in revenues before we become profitable 
we had  full time employees at december   up from at december  this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis 
in addition  we expect that future expansion will continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
competition is intense for highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
if our total revenue does not increase relative to our operating expenses  our management systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  we fail to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel  or our management otherwise fails to manage our expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
business combinations effective january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of engine  ltd

the total cost of the acquisition  including transaction costs of million  was approximately billion 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
accordingly  the acquired net assets were recorded at their estimated fair values at the effective date of the acquisition and the results of ondisplay have been included with those of the company for the periods subsequent to the date of the acquisition 
in connection with our respective acquisitions of engine  datasage and ondisplay  we incurred one time acquisition costs and integration related charges  which included costs associated with product integration  cross training  and other merger related costs 
additionally  a portion of the ondisplay and datasage purchase price was allocated to in process research and development based upon an independent third party appraisal and expensed upon the consummation of the transactions 
these related acquisition  integration and in process research and development charges totaled approximately million during fiscal year intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  represented and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
accounting reclassification effective december   we report as deferred revenue only amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized  and we report as accounts receivable only amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
deferred revenue and accounts receivable balances for all previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
this reclassification reduced our deferred revenue and accounts receivable balances by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
subsequent events in january  we initiated a restructuring plan that will allow us to streamline our operations and reduce our cost structure 
as part of this restructuring plan  which primarily consists of a workforce reduction and the consolidation of certain facilities  we expect to incur restructuring charges totaling approximately to million in in february  we issued approximately million restricted shares to certain employees who elected to participate in the company s stock option exchange program  a program that was designed to provide our employees with a long term incentive for maximizing shareholder value 
as a result of this transaction  we will record deferred compensation for the deemed market value of the restricted shares issued as of the grant date in the amount of approximately million 
beginning on or about may   we will amortize this amount to expense over the one year vesting period 
also under the same option exchange program  we canceled approximately million stock options previously granted to those employees who voluntarily participated in the program in exchange for new options that will be granted on or after august  the number of new options to be granted will be dependent on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and will range from to of the total options canceled 
the exercise price of these new options will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date 
the program has been organized to comply with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of revenues represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenue product license services total revenue cost of revenue product license services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of intangibles total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss revenue total revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in our client base  which grew from at the end of to at the end of and to  at the end of  an increase in the average size of new client orders and follow on orders from existing clients 
although our total revenue has increased in recent periods  we cannot be certain that total revenue will grow in future periods or that it will grow at similar rates as in the past 
product license 
product license revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in product license revenue in absolute dollars was due to increases in the number of clients and the average size of new client orders resulting from growing market acceptance of our product lines over prior periods  increased follow on orders from existing clients and orders influenced and implemented by third party integration partners 
services 
services revenue increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
services revenue from professional services fees continues to be the primary component of total services revenue  representing of total revenues in as compared to in and in the increase in all types of services revenue in absolute dollars was due primarily to an increase in the number of clients and the sale of product licenses  which generally include or lead to contracts to perform professional services and training and purchases of software maintenance and technical support service agreements 
we believe that growth in our product license sales depends on our ability to provide our clients with support  training  consulting and implementation services and educating third party resellers on how to implement our products 
as a result  we continued to expand our professional services organization throughout and intend to continue expanding our professional services organization for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenue product license 
product license costs consist of expenses we incur to manufacture  package and distribute our products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software incorporated into our products 
product license costs increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of product license revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in each period was principally a result of both product license sales growth and royalties paid to third party vendors for technology embedded in our product offerings 
product license costs were less as a percentage of product license revenue in and  as compared to  primarily because significant product license revenue growth outpaced increases in product license costs in addition to a higher average sales price in relative to and we expect product license costs to increase in the future in absolute dollar terms due to additional clients licensing our products and the acquisition of oem licenses to third party technology that we may choose to embed in our product offerings 
services 
services costs include salary expense and other related costs for our professional service  maintenance and customer support staffs  as well as third party contractor expenses 
services costs increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of services revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars resulted from the rapid expansion of our services organization 
the overall improvement in services gross profit margin reflects increased leverage from the productivity of support  training  consulting and implementation activities 
we expect services costs to increase in the future in absolute dollars to the extent that services revenues increase 
we expect services costs as a percentage of services revenue to continue to decrease over time 
services costs as a percentage of services revenue can be expected to vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide  whether such services are provided by us or third party contractors  and overall utilization rates 
professional services related costs increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of professional services related revenue 
maintenance and support related costs increased to million in from million in and from  in  representing  and of maintenance and support related revenue  respectively 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to the increase in engineering personnel and to the expansion of our product offerings 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in research and development expenditures 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage  and  as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
software development costs that were eligible for capitalization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed statement totaled million   and in  and  respectively 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars due to a significant increase in sales and marketing personnel  increased marketing program expenditures as well as higher commissions expense resulting from the absolute dollar growth in our customer bookings 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue resulted primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in sales and marketing expenditures 
we believe these expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expect to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to promote further growth 
we also anticipate that sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue from period to period as new sales personnel are hired and begin to achieve productivity and achieve commission accelerators as well as the timing of new product releases 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations  human resources  finance  accounting  information technology and legal employees and certain facilities related expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing  and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars for these periods was due to increased personnel  information technology and facility expenses necessary to support our expanding operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenue primarily because significant revenue growth outpaced increases in general and administrative expenditures 
we believe general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase staffing and infrastructure expenses to support our continued growth 
purchased in process research and development  acquisition related and other charges 
in connection with our acquisitions of ondisplay in july  datasage in february  engine in january and diffusion in june  we incurred one time acquisition costs and integration related charges  which include costs associated with product integration  cross training  and other merger related costs 
additionally  a portion of the diffusion  datasage and ondisplay purchase prices were allocated to in process research and development  or ipr d  based upon an independent third party appraisal 
the resulting ipr d was expensed at the time of purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
these related charges totaled million in and million in the independent third party ipr d valuations utilized a modified discounted cash flow model 
the cash flow projections for revenue were based on the projected incremental increase in revenue that was expected to be received from the completed acquired in process research and development 
revenue was assumed to continue for a period of five years  including a residual period beyond the five year analysis 
estimated operating expenses were deducted from estimated revenue to arrive at estimated pre tax cash flows 
projected operating expenses included cost of goods sold  selling general and administrative expense  and research and development expense 
operating expenses were estimated as a percent of revenue based on the respective acquired company s historical results 
projected results were also used in combination with past operating results and industry averages 
capital charges  or cash flow attributable to other assets such as fixed assets  working capital  trademark and assembled workforce  were deducted from pre tax operating income to isolate the cash flow attributable solely to in process research and development 
applicable income taxes were then deducted to arrive at after tax cash flows 
the after tax cash flow projections were discounted using a risk adjusted rate of return  ranging between and 
a tax amortization benefit was added to the discounted cash flows 
in using the discounted model  the costs to complete the respective in process technology were excluded from the research and development expense  and the percentage completion of the in process research and development was reflected in each year s projected cash flow 
the development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products and competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the valuations for our purchase acquisitions completed in and in thousands estimated cost to complete estimated stage technology at time acquisition of completion of acquisition fiscal ondisplay  datasage engine fiscal diffusion regarding our purchase acquisitions in and  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections upon the introduction of the products into the market 
shipment volumes of products from the above acquired technologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present time 
therefore  it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue projections early in the technology or product life cycle 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed 
in may  we acquired from randomnoise  inc certain in process research and development efforts  a developed product and an insignificant amount of equipment in exchange for million  consisting of  in cash and  shares of our series g preferred stock valued at million 
substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development and expensed upon the consummation of the transaction 
these charges totaled million in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for the stock options we award to employees from our stock option plans  we have recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed market value of our common stock at the time of such grants 
for the stock options we assumed in connection with our acquisition of ondisplay  we have recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the unvested stock options and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the acquisition date 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options  resulting in amortization expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangibles 
intangible amortization expense was million  million and in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to our acquisitions of diffusion  engine  datasage and ondisplay 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to adjust the carrying amount of our intangible assets due to our recent restructuring efforts  resulting in anticipated restructuring charges totaling million during the first quarter of fiscal year other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense 
other income  net increased to million in from million in and from  in the significant increase in and was due to interest income earned on higher cash balances  cash equivalents and short term investments resulting from both our secondary and initial public offerings in december and february  respectively  as well as cash acquired through our purchases of businesses 
provision for income taxes the company has incurred income tax expense of approximately million  and in  and  respectively 
the income tax expense consists primarily of foreign withholding taxes on income generated in non us tax jurisdictions 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and research and development carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
quarterly results the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of our last eight quarters 
this data has been derived from unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited consolidated financial statements and  in our opinion  include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information 
these unaudited quarterly results should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

accordingly  we base our forecast for expenses in part on future revenue projections 
most of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to forecast accurately our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of client demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including 
demand for our products and services  
the timing of sales of our products and services  
the timing of customer orders and product implementations  
unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  
increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  
changes in the rapidly evolving market for e business solutions  
the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  
the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  
the mix of domestic and international sales  and 
costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
we plan to increase our operating expenses to expand sales and marketing operations  develop new distribution channels  fund greater levels of research and development  broaden professional services and support and improve operational and financial systems 
if our revenues do not increase along with these expenses  our business  operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected and net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected 
we believe that our quarterly operating results may experience seasonal fluctuations 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on client calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns in europe and our compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
another example is the recent uncertainty surrounding the overall information technology spending environment and customer hesitancy to make large capital expenditures 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss and research and development carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates  beginning  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of million at december  were incurred by diffusion  engine  datasage and ondisplay prior to being acquired by us and will be subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss and research and development carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the valuation allowance includes approximately million related to the acquisition of diffusion  engine  datasage and ondisplay net deferred tax assets 
the initial recognition of these acquired deferred tax asset items will first reduce goodwill  then other non current intangible assets of the acquired entity 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward  which when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to deferred compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   up from million at december  net cash used in operating activities were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash outflows from to was due primarily to the integration activities resulting from the engine  datasage and ondisplay acquisitions in net cash inflows from investing activities were million in  as compared to net cash outflows of million and million in and  respectively 
our investing activities have consisted largely of capital expenditures totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  to acquire property and equipment  composed primarily of computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements for facilities expansions  for our growing employee base 
in addition  during our investing activities included purchases of equity securities totaling million for strategic investments in companies as compared to million and in and  respectively 
our investing activities have also included purchases of short term investments totaling million  million and in  and  respectively 
our investing cash outflows were offset by net cash acquired through purchases of businesses of million   and during  and  respectively 
we expect that our investing activities will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we support our continued growth 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our financing activities during resulted primarily from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchase of employee stock purchase plan shares 
our financing activities in resulted primarily from our initial and secondary public offerings 
during  we continued to expand our product offerings through the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses  namely engine  datasage and ondisplay 
in january  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of engine in exchange for million in cash and approximately  shares of vignette common stock 
in february  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of datasage in exchange for approximately million shares of vignette common stock 
in july  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock and assumed all outstanding stock options of ondisplay in exchange for approximately million shares of vignette common stock 
our long term investments  consisting primarily of redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held companies  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we classify these investments as available for sale and have recorded a cumulative net unrealized gain loss related to these securities of million and at december  and  respectively 
these purchases were made to enable us to invest in emerging technology companies strategic to our software business 
only one of the investments at december  is publicly traded 
there is no established market for the remaining equity investments and  therefore  they are valued based on the most recent round of financing involving new non strategic investors as well as estimates made by us 
the future value of these investments may be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions  and the ability of the companies to secure additional funding and execute on their respective business plans 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in e commerce companies as our product offerings expand  however  we do not expect the impact of this activity to be material to our liquidity position 
in addition to our strategic investments  million and of our long term investments was pledged as collateral for certain lease obligations at december  and  respectively 
there are certain time restrictions placed on these instruments that we are obligated to meet in order to liquidate the principal of these investments 
we anticipate that we will occupy more leased property in the future that will require similar pledged securities  however  we do not expect the impact of this activity to be material to our liquidity position 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash on hand  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may require additional funds for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public and private equity financings from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or that any additional financing will not be dilutive

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
statement  which defers for one year the effective date of statement as a result of the deferral provisions of statement  statement is now effective for our fiscal year we have minimal use of derivatives  except for our strategic investments that are generally in the form of redeemable convertible stock in privately held companies and equity instruments we own in privately held companies 
the adoption of statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in december  the securities and exchange commission staff released staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we have adopted sab for all transactions during the year ending december  such adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation interpretation  effective july  interpretation clarifies guidance for certain issues that arose in the application of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we have applied the requirements of interpretation in connection with our acquisition and assumption of all of ondisplay s outstanding stock options in july using the black scholes option valuation methodology  we assigned an estimated fair value of million to the employee stock options assumed 
approximately million of this amount was recorded as deferred stock compensation and is being amortized over the options remaining life 
the remaining was included in the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired and is being amortized over the asset s estimated useful life  which is equivalent to a four year period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations throughout latin america  asia pacific  europe  the middle east and africa and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has not been material 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in 
obligations of the us government and its agencies  
investment grade state and local government obligations  
securities of us corporations rated a or p by standard poors or the moody s equivalents  and or 
money market funds  deposits or notes issued or guaranteed by us and non us commercial banks meeting certain credit rating and net worth requirements with maturities of less than two years 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits and money market funds held by large institutions in the us  and our short term investments were invested in corporate debt maturing in less than days
