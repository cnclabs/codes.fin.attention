item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of psb bancorp  inc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of psb bancorp  inc  including the related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
results of operations for the years ended december   and general psb s results of operations depend primarily on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans receivable and investment securities  while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits and borrowings 
the bank s net income is also affected by its provision for loan losses and its level of non interest income as well as by its non interest expense  such as salary and employee benefits  occupancy costs and charges relating to non performing and other classified assets 
performance overview psb s net income for was  or on a diluted per share basis compared to net income of million or per diluted share for and net income of s million or per diluted share for the significant decrease in net income from to was the result of a one time charge taken by psb to reflect the write off of a million investment in bankzip 
com  an aggregator of internet banking services that has ceased operations 
psb s net income for  without the one time charge  would have been million or on a diluted per share basis 
the overall increase in psb s revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in volume in the bank s consumer loan portfolio and secondarily to a slight improvement in the yield on the overall loan portfolio 
the increase in net income from to was due largely to an increase in net interest income resulting from an improvement in the bank s net interest margin as discussed below 
net interest income and average balances net interest income is the key component of the bank s profitability structure and is managed in coordination with the bank s interest rate sensitivity position 
net interest income in of million was million or higher than s net interest income of million 
the bank had net interest income of million in which was higher than s net interest income of million 
the bank s net interest margin  net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets  increased basis points from in to in  primarily due to a million increase in the volume of the consumer loan portfolio and a basis point increase in the overall yield of the average interest earning assets 
in  the net interest margin increased basis points to from for the improvement in the bank s net interest margin in reflected an improvement in the bank s yield on interest earning assets  a lower cost of funds and the resolution of a significant portion of the bank s non performing assets portfolio and subsequent conversion of those assets to a performing basis 
the bank s net interest spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  increased basis points to in  however in  the bank experienced a decrease of basis points to from for although in  the bank experienced an overall increase in interest bearing liabilities  the rate paid on those liabilities increased by only basis points to from in  while the yield earned on interest earning assets increased basis points 
the decrease in the net interest spread to in from in was primarily due to a basis point increase in the average rate paid on borrowed money  and an increase in the amount of borrowed funds while the average yield on interest earning assets increased by only two basis points 
the bank s yield on average interest earning assets increased to for compared to in in  the bank s yield on average interest earning assets was identical to the yield for average loans of million at december  represented of total interest earning assets  providing an average yield of  average loans of million at december   represented of total average interest earning assets  and provided an average yield of  compared to average loans of million at december   representing of total average interest earning assets  and providing an average yield of 
the substantial increase in the yield on the loan portfolio in was due to the bank s successful strategy of increasing the volume of higher yielding consumer loans 
average investments and interest bearing deposits with banks decreased million or at december  from december  at december   average investments and interest bearing deposits with banks increased million or to million  from million at december  at december   total average interest bearing liabilities increased million or to million compared to million at december  total average interest bearing liabilities increased million or at december   from million at december  total interest expense increased million at december  to million as compared to a total interest expense increase of million to million at december  from million for the bank s cost of funds has continuously increased over the last three years from in to in and in net interest income of million in was higher than net interest income of million in net interest income of million in was higher than the total of million 
in  total interest income increased million to million compared to an increase in of million to million from million in the bank had an increase in total interest expense in of million compared to an increase in of million

the bank determines the level of the allowance for loan losses through a regular review of the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an examination of the portfolio as well as such factors as declining trends  the volume of loan concentrations  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  prior loss experience within the portfolio  current economic conditions and the results of the most recent regulatory examinations 
the bank allocated   and  as additions to the allowance for loan loss and had charge offs against the allowance of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for loan losses  there can be no assurance that the bank will not have to increase its provision for loan losses in the future as a result of possible future increases to its non performing loans or for other reasons based on changes in facts and circumstances 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and the carrying value of its non performing assets 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to its allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
non interest income the following table provides a summary of non interest income  by category of income  for the three years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  service fees on deposit accounts other total  the major source of non interest income is gain on sale of loans  other income and service fees on deposit accounts

income taxes the company had an income tax provision of  an income tax credit of  and an income tax provision of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the credit resulted from net operating loss carry forwards that were held by first bank of philadelphia and used by psb 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity integral to the management of psb s balance sheet is the maintaining of adequate liquidity and the ability to evaluate and control interest rate risk 
liquidity represents the ability to meet potential cash outflows resulting from deposit customers who need to withdraw funds or borrowers who need available credit 
interest rate sensitivity focuses on the impact of fluctuating interest rates and the repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on net interest income 
psb s asset liability management committee monitors the level of short term assets and liabilities to maintain an appropriate balance between liquidity  risk  and return 
liquidity is derived from various sources that includes increases in core deposits  sales of certificates of deposits  loan principal repayments and loan maturities and cash received on maturities or amortization of investment securities 
the liquidity position of psb is also strengthened by a million credit facility with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh fhlb 
advances are secured by fhlb stock and qualifying mortgage loans 
there were no advances outstanding against this line at december  and million at december  there were no advances outstanding against this line at december  maximizing cash flow over time is crucial to the maintenance of adequate liquidity 
psb s total cash flow is a product of its operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
during the twelve month period ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the same period of during the twelve month period ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million  compared to net cash used by investing activities of million for the same period of financing activities used net cash of million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million in net cash provided in financing activities for the same period of the net result of these items was a  increase in cash and cash equivalents for the twelve month period ended december   compared to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the same period of the increase in cash and cash equivalents in is primarily due to a decrease in loans receivable of million  a decrease in purchase of investments and a decrease in borrowed funds of million 
during  net cash used in operating activities was  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in during  psb s investing activities used million in net cash and psb s financing activities provided million in net cash 
in  psb s investing activities used million in net cash and psb s financing activities provided million in net cash 
the major components within these two categories during were an increase in total loans receivable of million and proceeds from borrowed funds of million 
the net result of these items was a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents for  compared to a net increase of million for this significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents in reflects management s decision to redeploy cash and interest earning deposits into investment securities 
interest rate risk management is closely related to liquidity management because each is directly affected by the maturity of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk management monitors the effect that fluctuations in interest rates have on net interest income 
the primary function of psb s interest rate sensitivity management is to reduce exposure to interest rate risk through an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the goal is to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin of the bank due to general changes in interest rates 
the net interest margin of a bank that does not have a relatively close relationship between the quantity of assets that mature or re price within a given time period and the quantity of liabilities that mature or re price within the same time period will fluctuate more widely than a bank that has a closer match 
furthermore  a bank that has liabilities that reprice earlier than its assets will have a decline in its net interest margin as interest rates rise 
the blending of fixed and floating rate loans and investments to match their pricing and maturity characteristics of the various funding sources is a continuous process in an attempt to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
the composition of the balance sheet is designed to minimize any significant fluctuation in net interest income and to maximize liquidity 
management believes that the accessibility to fhlb borrowings will provide the flexibility to assist in keeping fluctuations in net interest income under control and to maintain an adequate liquidity position 
one tool used by management to gauge the structure of the balance sheet is a gap analysis that categorizes assets and liabilities on the basis of maturity date  the date of next re pricing  and the applicable amortization schedule 
this analysis summarizes the matching or mismatching of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities according to specified time periods 
management concentrates on the zero to three month and one year gap intervals 
at december   psb had a one year liability sensitive gap of million and a gap ratio of or of total assets as of that date 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitive data at december  in thousands interest rate sensitivity analysis as of december  more balance than no stated at gap table at december  months months yrs yrs maturity interest bearing deposits with banks   investment securities       mortgage loans      commercial loans     consumer loans   student loans   construction loans   sba loans   other assets   total assets       non interest bearing deposits   now accounts   money market accounts    savings accounts    time deposits     borrowed funds   other liabilities   total liabilities       shareholder s equity   total liabilities and shareholder s      equity gap      cumulative gap     cumulative gap ratio capital adequacy the bank is required to maintain minimum ratios of tier i and total capital to total risk weighted assets and a minimum tier i leverage ratio  as defined by the banking regulators 
at december   the bank was required to have minimum tier i and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of 
the bank s actual tier i and total capital ratios at december  were and  respectively  and the bank s tier i leverage ratio was 
these ratios exceed the requirements for classification as a well capitalized institution  the industry s highest capital category 
capital ratios increased during over due to a decrease in total risk adjusted assets and a increase in tier and total capital from to the decline in capital ratios during over was due to a increase in total risk adjusted assets from to following are the bank s risk based capital ratios at december   and dollars in thousands december  tier i capital    tier ii capital   total qualifying capital    risk adjustment total assets    tier i risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio management expects that the bank s capital ratios will decrease significantly as a result of the largely cash acquisition of jade financial corp expected to close in the second quarter of nevertheless  management is confident that the bank will remain well capitalized 
financial condition general psb s total assets decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in assets was primarily the result of a decrease in net loans receivable and investments 
this decrease in assets was a strategy implemented by management in consideration of the pending cash acquisition of jade financial corp 
and the effect of the acquisition on the bank s capital ratios 
total assets of psb increased million or during  from million at december  the major reason for this increase in total assets during was a increase in securities purchased under agreement to resell  a million increase in advances from the fhlb  and a million increase in total deposits 
this increased use of leverage was a strategy initiated by management with the assistance of its nationally recognized  affiliate mcguire performance solutions  to better utilize excess capital and increase earnings and return on equity 
net loans decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease of million  or  was the result of payoffs in psb s student loan program without a corresponding increase in the volume of student loans to offset the payoffs 
a decrease in construction  commercial  and non residential loans were also contributing factors 
increased loan origination of other loan products such as commercial real estate  sba loans and consumer loans as well as modest growth in residential mortgage loans were not significant enough to offset the decreases in the other portions of the loan portfolio 
net loans increased to million for the year ended december  from million at december  the increase in loan volume was primarily a result of psb s student loan program 
this program was an existing program of first bank of philadelphia 
these loans are funded to students at qualifying schools and are subsequently contractually sold at par within to days of origination to an investor 
other real estate owned decreased by  because psb sold properties from its portfolio 
total shareholders equity increased by  resulting from net income for of  and a repurchase of common stock 
investment activities the bank s investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  and cash and cash equivalents 
the carrying value of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  the bank s cash and cash equivalents  consisting of cash and due from banks  and interest earning deposits with other financial institutions  totaled million at december  compared to million at december   and million at december  the majority of the bank s mortgage backed securities are issued or guaranteed by the united states government or agencies thereof 
at december   mortgage backed securities totaled million compared to million at december  the majority of this amount represents securities that were issued or guaranteed by either fnma  fhlmc or the government national mortgage association gnma 
the bank historically maintains high levels of interest earning deposits as part of its strategy for meeting liquidity requirements and improving interest sensitivity 
the bank is required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short term securities and certain other investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the bank generally has maintained a portfolio of liquid assets that exceeds regulatory requirements 
liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the level of yield that will be available in the future  as well as management s projections as to the short term demand for funds to be used in the bank s loan origination and other activities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 which the bank adopted in  the bank classifies its investment securities and mortgage backed securities as either held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
available for sale and trading securities are carried at market value  while held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost 
at december   million of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities were classified held to maturity and million of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities were classified available for sale 
the bank did not carry any trading securities at december  the bank s board of directors has also adopted an investment policy that identifies acceptable types of investments for the bank and establishes criteria to guide management in classifying investments as prescribed by sfas no 
the policy also authorizes the bank s investment officer to make investments of up to million 
under the investment policy  the bank may invest in certain aaa rated derivative securities 
as of december   the bank had no collateralized mortgage obligations 
the bank may not invest in high risk collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and the bank s investment officer must periodically analyze the risk of any cmo held by bank to determine that such securities are not within the high risk category

the bank and its subsidiaries also originate loans secured by multifamily residential and commercial real estate  construction loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
also  as a result of the merger with first bank of philadelphia  the bank maintains a student loan program which was an existing program of first bank of philadelphia and now appears in psb s consolidated results 
these loans are funded to students at qualifying schools and are subsequently contractually sold at par within to days of origination to an investor 
one to four family residential mortgage loans originated for resale in the secondary market are underwritten according to standards that conform to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc guidelines 
one to four family residential mortgage loans originated and held in portfolio are generally underwritten to conform to secondary market standards but from time to time the bank does originate nonconforming loans if  in the bank s judgment  the borrower does not present an unreasonable risk of default 
the bank and transnational mortgage corp 
tnmc  its mortgage banking subsidiary  have sold in the secondary market a limited amount of fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
the bank has primarily been a portfolio lender and at any one time the bank holds only a nominal amount of loans that may be sold

contacts are generally made on the th day after a payment in due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency extends beyond days  the loan and payment history is carefully reviewed  additional notices are sent to the borrower and efforts are made to collect the loan 
while the bank generally prefers to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  when the account becomes days delinquent  the bank does institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
non performing assets in  the bank s level of non performing assets increased million or to million compared to a decrease of  or to million at december  from million at december  the primary reason for the increase in non performing assets in was the transfer of a number of first bank of philadelphia loans assumed in the merger being reclassified as non performing 
contributing to the decrease in were net decreases of  in the bank s oreo portfolio and  in the bank s non accrual portfolio  attributable to continuing legal action against the bank s problem loan customers  through foreclosure and other court actions and aggressive account management on the bank s performing loan portfolio to minimize future problems 
as a matter of policy  the accrual of loan interest is discontinued if management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest becomes doubtful 
this is normally done when a loan reaches days delinquent 
at this time  all accrued but unpaid interest is backed out of interest income 
there are occasional exceptions if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the bank did not have any material restructured loans within the meaning of sfas no 
the following table sets forth information regarding loans or more days delinquent and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and owned real estate held by the bank at the dates indicated dollars in thousands at december  loans past due days or more as to interest or principal and accruing interest  nonaccrual loans      loans restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal total nonperforming loans      real estate owned reo      total nonperforming assets      nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets allowance for loan losses to total loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets net charge offs as a percentage of total loans other real estate owned real estate acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned oreo until it is sold 
the oreo is initially recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or fair value of the property at the date acquired 
if the value of the property is less than the loan  less any related specific loan loss provisions  the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent write down of oreo is charged against earnings 
the bank had million and million of property acquired as a result of foreclosure at december  and classified assets as part of the bank s loan review procedures which ultimately results in the establishment of the bank s allowance for loan losses  the bank identifies and classifies its problem assets into three classifications substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the bank is not warranted 
the bank charges off that portion of an asset as soon as it is classified as a loss 
exclusive of the bank s million of oreo  the bank s classified assets at december  consisted of of loans classified as substandard  compared to  classified as substandard at december  allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an amount charged against earnings to fund the allowance for loan losses on existing loans 
in order to determine the amount of the provision for loan losses  the bank conducts a monthly review of the loan portfolio to evaluate overall credit quality 
in establishing its allowance for loan losses  management considers the size and risk exposure for each segment of the loan portfolio  past loss experience  current indicators such as the present levels and trends of delinquency rates and collateral values  and the potential losses for future periods 
the provisions are based on management s review of the economy  interest rates  general market conditions  and in certain instances  an estimate of fair value of the collateral  as applicable  considering the current and anticipated future operating environment 
these estimates are particularly susceptible to changes that may result in a material adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
as adjustments become identified  they are reported in earnings for the period in which they become known 
management believes that it makes an informed judgment based upon available information 
the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the board of directors 
it is the objective of the bank s evaluation process to establish the following components of the allowance for loan losses 
a specific allocation for certain identified loans  a general allocation for pools of loans based on risk rating and a general allocation for inherent loan portfolio losses 
management performs current evaluations of its criticized and classified loan portfolios and assigns specific reserves that reflects the current risk to the bank 
as a general rule  special mention assets will have a minimum reserve of  substandard assets will have a minimum reserve of  and doubtful assets will have a minimum reserve of 
due to the fact that most of the bank s problem loans are secured by real estate  management has allocated a majority of the allowance for loan losses to these real estate collateralized loans

borrowings the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system  which consists of regional fhlbs subject to supervision and regulation by the federal housing finance board 
the fhlbs provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh  is required to hold shares of common stock in that fhlb in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  whichever is greater

management s choice not to increase the asset size of the bank through additional borrowing was made as a result of the pending acquisition of jade financial corp 
and its effect on the capital ratios of the bank 
impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the bank is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
the bank believes that continuation of its efforts to manage the rates  liquidity and interest sensitivity of its assets and liabilities is necessary to generate an acceptable return on assets
