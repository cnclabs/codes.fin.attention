the company s profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets less the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan loss reserves  and its effective income tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of loan and other banking fees 
noninterest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment related expenses  data processing expenses  advertising expense  deposit insurance premiums and other operating expenses

net interest and dividend income increased to  in  from  in the improvement was attributable to a  increase in the average loan portfolio  partially offset by a decline in the company s interest rate spread from to 
the growth in the loan portfolio was funded primarily by a  increase in average deposits 
the company s cost of funds in increased basis points to due to the rising interest rate environment  as evidenced by the federal reserve board increasing the federal funds target rate on six occasions between june and june  for a total of basis points 
this resulted in higher rates paid for deposit accounts and floating rate debentures  as well as an increase in depositors preference for certificates of deposit accounts  which normally have higher rates than savings and money market accounts 
the company s yield on earning assets in increased basis point to due to higher yields earned on investment securities and other short term investments  partially offset by a decline in the yield on the loan portfolio 
despite the higher rate environment  the average yield on the loan portfolio declined to from  due to competitive lending conditions which resulted in originations of new loans with lower rates than the average yield of the portfolio in  as well as prepayments of higher yielding loans 
the effect of the preceding was partially offset by rate increases on floating rate loans

other short term investments are normally comprised of bank commercial paper  certificates of deposit and us government securities 
the level of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates based on various factors  including liquidity needs  loan demand  deposit flows  repayments of borrowed funds and alternative security investment opportunities 
securities the company invests in securities after satisfying its liquidity objectives and lending commitments 
the company has historically only purchased securities that are issued by the us government or one of its agencies 
the company s security investments have lower yields than its loan portfolio 
to manage interest rate risk  the company normally purchases securities that have adjustable rates or securities with fixed rates that have short to intermediate maturity terms 
from time to time  the banks maintain a securities available for sale portfolio to provide flexibility in implementing asset liability management strategies 
on december   intervest bank transferred its entire securities held to maturity portfolio consisting of us government agency securities with an estimated fair value of  to the securities available for sale portfolio 
at december   a valuation allowance of  which represents the unrealized loss on securities available for sale  net of taxes  was recorded as a component of stockholders equity in connection with this transfer 
the available for sale portfolio consists of fixed rate debt obligations of the federal home loan bank fhlb  federal farm credit bank ffcb and federal national mortgage association fnma 
most of the securities have terms that allow the issuer the right to call or prepay its obligation without prepayment penalty 
there were no sales of securities during  and  and no transfers of securities to the available for sale portfolio in or the company does not engage in trading activities 
securities for which the banks have the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
securities held to maturity totaled  at december   compared to  at december  the decrease reflected the transfer discussed above  partially offset by additional purchases 
the estimated fair value of the held to maturity portfolio was  at december  and  at december  at december   securities held to maturity consisted of intervest national bank s holdings of short term due in one year or less  fixed rate debt obligations of the fhlb  fnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc

loan concentrations are defined as amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause the loans to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
credit risk  which represents the possibility of the company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers  is significantly related to local economic conditions in the areas the properties are located  as well as the company s underwriting standards 
economic conditions affect the market value of the underlying collateral as well as the levels of occupancy of income producing properties such as office buildings  shopping centers and rental and cooperative apartment buildings

the company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify a loan as nonaccrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not adequately collateralized and in the process of collection  or when in the opinion of the company s management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the loan 
allowance for loan loss reserves the allowance for loan loss reserves is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans and commitments and estimates of fair value thereof  historical chargeoffs and recoveries  adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and management s perception of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan loss reserves  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
in addition  sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan loss reserves related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan loss reserves and a charge through the provision for loan loss reserves 
the company s policy is to charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
the net carrying amount of an impaired loan does not at any time exceed the recorded investment in the loan 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis  except for smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as consumer loans  whose evaluation for impairment is done on an aggregate basis 
for consumer loans  historical charge off experience as well as the charge off experience of peer groups and industry statistics are used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss reserves 
the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan loss reserves 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination 
at december   the company s allowance for loan loss reserves amounted to  compared to  at year end the increase reflected the growth in the loan portfolio 
during and  the company did not have any loans on a nonaccrual status or classified as impaired 
at december  and  the allowance for loan loss reserves was predominately allocated to commercial real estate and multifamily loans

all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of all other assets at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable   loans fee receivable  premises and equipment  net   deferred income tax asset  deferred debenture offering costs   all other accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the amount of loans  investments and other interest earning assets outstanding 
the increase reflected growth in these accounts 
loan fees receivable are fees due to the company in accordance with the terms of mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
this fee is recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan 
the increase was due to an increase in mortgage loans outstanding 
premises and equipment is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the deferred income tax asset relates primarily to the unrealized tax benefit on the company s allowance for loan loss reserves and organizational start up costs 
these charges have been expensed for financial statement purposes  but are not all currently deductible for income tax purposes 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income by the company during the periods in which these temporary differences become deductible for tax purposes 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax asset will be realized and accordingly  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not maintained at any time during and deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the decline was due to normal amortization as well as the accelerated amortization of  in connection with the early retirement of debentures

asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of the asset and liability committee alco of the board of directors of each bank  which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within a one year time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps or collars which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
for purposes of creating the gap analysis that follows  deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
given this assumption  the company s negative one year interest rate sensitivity gap was at december  and at december  however  if those deposits were treated differently  then the interest rate sensitivity gap would change 
the behavior of core depositors may not necessarily result in the immediate withdrawal of funds in the event deposit rates offered by the banks did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the company s one year interest rate sensitivity gap would have been a positive at year end  compared to a negative at year end the company has a floor  or minimum rate  on many of its floating rate loans 
the floor for each specific loan is determined in relation to the prevailing market rates on the date of origination and most adjust upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services
