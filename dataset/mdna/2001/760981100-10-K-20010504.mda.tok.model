our primary capital requirements have been for new store development  working capital and general corporate needs

the availability under the credit facility was limited by reference to a borrowing base calculation  based upon eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
the agreement contained restrictive covenants  including minimum levels of quarterly earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  minimum levels of debt to ebitda  and annual capital expenditure limits

and  shares of our common stock to enhanced retail funding  llc  each at per share 
the warrant expires on september  the fair value of the warrants was calculated using the black scholes method and was estimated at  the deferred debt issuance cost reduces the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized over the life of the debt 
as further discussed in footnote to the attached consolidated financial statements  on march   we announced the completion of a private placement offering of our preferred stock with aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately million  the appointment of mr 
friedman as our new chief executive officer and an amendment to our existing bank agreement for our line of credit

while we currently believe that our cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will satisfy our capital requirements for at least the next months  adverse developments concerning our sales performance or the availability of credit under our credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
moreover  we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs and  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders

quarterly results of operations first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter dollars in thousands  except percentage and per share data statements of consolidated operations data net sales     gross profit     as a of net sales income loss from operations     comp store net sales increase net income loss per share basic diluted first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter dollars in thousands  except percentage and per share data statements of consolidated operations data net sales     gross profit     as a of net sales income loss from operations     comp store net sales increase net income loss per share basic diluted net sales amounts have been adjusted to include shipping fees in accordance with our adoption of eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
basic earnings per share is calculated for interim periods including the effect of stock options exercised in prior interim periods 
basic earnings per share for the fiscal year is calculated using weighted shares outstanding based on the date stock options were exercised 
therefore  basic earnings per share for the cumulative four quarters may not equal fiscal year basic earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year and for quarters with net earnings are computed based on weighted average common stock equivalents stock options and warrants 
net loss per share for quarters with net losses is computed based solely on weighted average common shares outstanding 
therefore  the earnings loss per share for each quarter do not sum up to the earnings for the full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
