item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction in fiscal  apogee experienced enhanced revenues and earnings primarily through improved operational efficiencies  as well as through better equipment utilization and increased market share 
highlights for the year included the following o realignment of the reporting segments with the markets they serve to underscore apogee s growth potential and to reflect apogee s changing business mix and focus 
o completion of the ramp up of the fiscal start up of apogee s statesboro  georgia plant to support viracon s continued growth for high end manufactured architectural glass 
o formation of ppg auto glass  llc joint venture to enhance efficiency  geographic coverage and customer service in the distribution of auto replacement glass 
o improved operating efficiencies through cost reduction initiatives at apogee s harmon autoglass  which are expected to result in annual savings of million 
o acquisition of two manufacturers in the billion pre framed art market  which expands the markets for apogee s tru vue products 
o reduction of long term debt to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal performance fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the results of the auto glass distribution unit  which apogee contributed to the ppg auto glass joint venture  were not included in apogee s continuing operations for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as they were through the second quarter of fiscal fiscal revenues grew compared to the prior year after being adjusted for the formation of the joint venture 
the majority of the increase is attributable to increased unit production due to the full year impact of plant expansions completed during fiscal  enhanced equipment utilization and the impact of fiscal year acquisitions 
additionally  fiscal comprised of weeks while fiscal comprised of weeks 
the following table illustrates the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended march  fiscal results are restated to reflect the effect of discontinued operations reported during fiscal percent of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net equity in income loss of affiliated companies earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net net earnings on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  fell to for fiscal  improving from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting increase in gross profit percentage were improved performance attributable to enhanced manufacturing performance within the architectural and large scale optical segments  as well as cost reduction initiatives within the automotive replacement glass segment 
these improvements were partially offset by higher general liability and health insurance related expenses across all segments 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of sales  decreased to from 
after being adjusted for the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture  sg a expenses decreased  as a percentage of sales  from in fiscal the primary factor for the decrease was due to the cost reduction initiatives implemented at the automotive replacement glass segment  as well as reductions in expenses related to doubtful accounts across all segments 
these were offset by increases in amounts expensed for bonuses and incentives 
net interest expense rose slightly to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase reflected higher weighted average interest rates under the company s revolving credit agreement 
this was somewhat offset by lower average borrowing levels during fiscal as compared to fiscal apogee s equity in income from affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to an equity in loss from affiliated companies of million a year ago 
income associated with the company s ppg auto glass joint venture  including rationalization and other transaction related adjustments  was offset by the company s terrasun research and development joint venture 
the ppg auto glass joint venture formed on july   combined the company s and ppg s us automotive replacement glass distribution businesses into a newly formed entity  ppg auto glass  llc  with the company having a ownership interest in the joint venture 
fiscal results were largely attributable to terrasun 
apogee s effective income tax rate of of pre tax earnings from continuing operations decreased from the of pre tax earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal this reduction is due to the relationship of book and tax differences as a percentage of pre tax income 
apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations increased to million or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
the company reported earnings from operations of discontinued businesses of million after tax  or diluted earnings per share for fiscal as compared to million after tax  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
apogee s fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
the return on average shareholders equity was in fiscal versus for fiscal segment analysis during fiscal  the company realigned its operating business units into three reporting segments 
the following is a discussion on the results of operations of these three business segments 
see note business segments data in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
in thousands architectural products and services net sales    operating income    large scale optical technologies net sales    operating income loss   automotive replacement glass and services net sales    operating income   architectural products and services architectural 
architectural companies design  engineer  fabricate and install the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
the businesses in this segment include viracon  the leading global fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass  harmon  inc  the company s full service building glass installation and maintenance business  wausau window wall systems  a manufacturer of custom  non residential aluminum window systems and curtainwall  and linetec  one of the largest us architectural paint and anodizing finishers 
architectural net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal viracon reported an increase in net sales of  mostly due to the increased capacity from the full year impact associated with the completion of the statesboro facility 
additionally  strong customer demand for viracon s high performance architectural glass products significantly improved sales volume 
harmon  inc reported a increase in net sales  primarily due to an increased number of curtainwall installation projects and linetec improved sales by 
these increases were offset by a slow down in shipments at wausau window wall systems due to the facility not being able to fill its available short lead time capacity during the second half of the year 
operating income for the segment of million represented an increase of over prior year 
this was the result of increased production capacity and improved utilization at viracon as well as increased earnings at harmon  inc and linetec 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in earnings at wausau window wall systems 
the architectural segment backlog  at march   remained at record levels of million  compared to million at february  large scale optical technologies lso 
lso companies develop and produce high technology glass that enhances the visual performance of products for the display  imaging and picture framing industries 
businesses in this segment include tru vue  a leading us value added glass and matboard manufacturer for the art and framing industry  and viratec thin films  a leading global producer of optical thin film coatings for the display and imaging markets 
lso net sales of million represented a increase over fiscal tru vue reported a improvement in sales due to increased demand for their high margin  value added glass products 
additionally  tru vue expanded its pre framed art business through the acquisitions of balangier fine art and designs  and corporate art services  inc these acquisitions represent percent of the tru vue increase for fiscal sales 
viratec reported a net sales increase of over fiscal levels due to strong operational improvement that allowed for significant volume growth 
lso operating income of million for fiscal compared favorably to an operating loss of million for fiscal the increase was the result of the increased sales volume at both of the segment s operations as well as the impact of sales of higher margin products from tru vue and improved equipment utilization at viratec 
these increases were offset by acquisition related integration costs at tru vue and the impact of shut down costs for viratec s san diego facility 
the shut down of the san diego facility will not have a material impact on next year s financial results 
automotive replacement glass and services auto glass 
auto glass companies fabricate  repair and replace automobile windshields and windows 
businesses in this segment include harmon autoglass  the nation s second largest chain of retail auto glass replacement and repair stores  and viracon curvlite  a leading us fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields 
auto glass net sales decreased to million in fiscal fiscal revenues for the segment grew compared to the prior year after being adjusted for the formation of the ppg auto glass joint venture 
net sales of the auto glass retail unit decreased compared with those of a year ago due  in part  to soft demand for auto replacement glass services 
the retail unit volume decrease was offset by unit price increases 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us rose during fiscal in an effort to improve margins  harmon autoglass closed retail facilities and implemented strategies to reduce low margin business 
this resulted in a reduction in volume of 
auto glass operating income increased to million for fiscal from operating income of million in fiscal during fiscal  as part of the company s initiative to maintain customer service and reduce costs  harmon autoglass reduced headcount through position eliminations  closed underperforming stores  or nearly of its retail locations  and transitioned call center operations to apac customer services  inc harmon autoglass continued to maintain a presence in most markets where shop closings occurred 
viracon curvlite reported slightly increased operating income over the prior year 
at the end of fiscal  auto glass had harmon autoglass retail locations and co branded facilities 
the segment continues to explore opportunities to increase utilization and improve efficiencies 
discontinued operations 
during fiscal  the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vis n service corporation vis n  a non auto glass focused  third party administered claims processor  in two separate transactions with no impact to net earnings 
in fiscal  the company completed the sale of of the stock of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  harmon  ltd 
in fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the divestiture of the detention security operations and the company executed the sale of the business 
the sale of harmon  ltd 
and the company s detention security business combined with the fiscal exit from international curtainwall operations effectively removed the company from the large scale construction business 
accordingly  these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes 
prior periods have been restated 
the company reported after tax operating income from the businesses reported as discontinued operations for fiscal of million 
this was primarily the result of cash collected from our international curtainwall operations during fiscal that exceeded the anticipated receipts 
for fiscal  after tax earnings from discontinued operations were million 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased in the architectural products and services architectural segment  and at the large scale optical technologies lso segment 
net sales at the automotive replacement glass and services auto glass segment were flat compared to fiscal on a consolidated basis  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  rose slightly to  up from in fiscal the primary factors underlying the resulting decline in gross profit were slower than anticipated production ramp ups within the architectural and lso segments along with increased costs to increase production velocity at viracon 
additionally  apogee experienced increased costs associated with meeting demand in these segments as well as a decline in margin in the auto glass businesses 
these factors were offset by margin improvements at harmon  inc selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by million  or 
the primary factors for the growth were an increase in salaries  allowance for doubtful accounts  marketing costs  outside services  information systems and severance costs  offset by a decrease in bonuses and incentives 
a portion of the increased personnel costs represented classification variances associated with the company s many system conversions  quantification of such classifications is not considered cost effective 
gross profit benefited as a result of these classification variances 
net interest expense rose to million in fiscal the increase reflected higher weighted average outstanding borrowing levels and to a lesser extent  slightly higher interest rates under the company s revolving credit agreement 
apogee s effective income tax rate was of pre tax earnings from continuing operations  up substantially from the rate recorded in fiscal apogee s equity in loss of affiliated companies was million in fiscal compared to million a year ago  largely associated with the company s terrasun research and development joint venture 
apogee s fiscal earnings from continuing operations declined to million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
earnings from operations of discontinued businesses were million after tax  or diluted earnings per share  compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year earlier 
apogee s fiscal net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share 
this compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  a year ago 
the return on average shareholders equity was in fiscal versus for fiscal segment analysis the following is a discussion of the results of operations of the company s three business segments 
see note business segments data in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a three year history of each segment s net sales  operating income  identifiable assets  capital expenditures  and depreciation and amortization 
architectural products and services architectural 
net sales for the architectural segment for fiscal increased to million  while operating income decreased to million for the year 
viracon  the segment s architectural glass fabrication unit  reported a net sales increase of  while operating earnings decreased significantly in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in profitability was the result of a decrease in earnings at the owatonna  minnesota plant and start up losses and slower than expected ramp up at its statesboro  georgia facility 
operating earnings at the owatonna plant were down compared to fiscal due to reduced operating rates and additional costs incurred to position the facility for improved production velocity 
the harmon  inc business had a solid year 
net sales grew by  while operating income rose by 
continuing operating improvements and an emphasis toward higher margin business helped the unit s profitability 
wausau window wall systems  which manufactures commercial windows  had increased sales of for the year 
operating income decreased for the facility compared to fiscal linetec  which provides painting and anodizing services  leveraged higher net sales into a significant operating income increase 
this business also continued to benefit from improvements in its engineering capabilities 
large scale optical technologies lso 
lso reported a net sales improvement for fiscal of to million while reporting a significant decrease in earnings as compared to the prior year 
tru vue  the segment s value added art framing glass and matboard fabrication unit  posted a improvement in sales  while earnings rose by 
these results reflect increased penetration of the unit s value added products and increased capacity and efficiency due to the second quarter completion of a new production facility in chicago 
viratec  which applies optical grade coatings to glass and other substrates  reported a net sales increase of  while recording an operating loss 
the operating loss was primarily due to viratec s flat glass operation which encountered significant downtime with the start up of its new vertical coater 
the vertical coater became operational in the third quarter but continued to experience problems during the remainder of the year 
also  in mid year  viratec s san diego crt coating operation lost significant production time during a technology changeover to accommodate a new product 
automotive replacement glass and services auto glass 
during fiscal and  auto glass operated auto glass businesses under the harmon autoglass harmon  harmon solutions group solutions  glass depot and viracon curvlite brands 
due to an industry merger in  harmon became the second largest company in the auto glass repair and replacement industry 
fiscal net sales at auto glass remained flat as compared to fiscal net sales while operating income decreased significantly 
net sales of the auto glass retail unit decreased slightly compared with those of fiscal  although unit volume was flat 
a significant operating loss was recorded due to increased competitive pricing pressures in the retail business and soft retail demand 
market data indicates that unit demand for replacement auto glass in the us fell nominally in same location retail net sales decreased by  while unit net sales were flat with last year 
to respond to changing market conditions  the business was restructured during fiscal to reduce fixed cost overhead 
in fiscal  retail auto facilities were closed 
in addition  employee headcount was reduced at auto glass headquarters and to a lesser extent in the field workforce 
in addition  retail coverage in closed store markets was being maintained by mobile vans and service centers operated from facilities shared with businesses outside of the company 
unit sales trends for the autoglass retail unit continued to outpace the industry 
the segment s manufacturing operation  viracon curvlite  fabricates auto glass for the replacement auto glass aftermarket 
viracon curvlite s net sales in fiscal decreased slightly 
the unit s national distribution center  which offered other manufacturers products as well as viracon curvlite s products for both domestic and foreign vehicles  and the autoglass express program  a delivery system to fill customer orders more quickly and completely  accounted for an increase in unit sales 
this increase was offset by a decrease in unit sales for the broker program  resulting in a slight decrease in unit sales for fiscal  compared to fiscal about of viracon curvlite s net sales were made to the glass depot unit in fiscal at fiscal year end  auto glass had harmon autoglass retail locations  co branded facilities and glass depot distribution centers 
discontinued operations 
in late fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the exit from the company s interest in vis n service corporation vis n  a non auto glass focused  third party administered claims processor 
in addition  during fiscal  the company completed the sale of of the stock of its large scale domestic curtainwall business  harmon  ltd 
in fiscal  apogee s board of directors authorized the divestiture of the detention security and domestic curtainwall operations 
on december   the segment executed the sale of its detention security business  effective november  combined with the fiscal exit from international curtainwall operations  these transactions effectively remove the company from the large scale construction business  in addition to the non auto glass focused third party administered claims processing business 
accordingly  these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
operating results from the businesses reported as discontinued operations improved significantly over fiscal for fiscal  earnings from discontinued operations were million after tax compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources year ended march  february  in thousands  except percentages cash provided by operations   capital expenditures   acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired   proceeds from dispositions of property   payments on long term debt  net   debt to invested capital net cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to last year 
the increase was due to improved cash flow generated by the operating companies during the year  primarily from improved results 
the company reduced working capital by million during the year  primarily related to contribution of inventory to the ppg auto glass joint venture  but also due to continued focus on reducing working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities 
new capital investment in fiscal totaled million  versus million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this reduction is the result of focusing on the expenditures made in the prior years by completing the start up at viracon s statesboro facility and of the vertical coater at viratec s faribault  minnesota operation 
in addition  in fiscal  the lso segment expanded its pre framed art business by purchasing two high end pre framed art businesses 
the aggregate purchase price for these businesses was million  including goodwill of million 
during fiscal  the company entered into a million sale leaseback associated with miscellaneous operating equipment 
in fiscal  the company entered into a million sale leaseback associated with miscellaneous operating equipment 
the company used the proceeds of these sale leaseback transactions to reduce the company s long term floating rate debt and replaced it with eight year fixed rate operating leases 
in fiscal  the company expects to incur capital expenditures as necessary to maintain existing facilities and information systems 
fiscal expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities 
in may  the company obtained a five year  committed credit facility in the amount of million 
this credit facility requires apogee to maintain minimum levels of net worth and certain financial ratios 
the total commitment of the credit facility was reduced by the sales price  net of taxes  of the fiscal sale of the detention security business  resulting in a committed credit facility of million as of february  the total commitment of the credit facility was also reduced in april  resulting in a committed credit facility of million as of march  the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and intangibles secure the credit facility 
based upon the company s satisfaction of certain financial covenants during fiscal  the company has the right to cause this security interest to be released upon its request 
long term debt  including current installments of million  stood at million at march   down million from a year earlier 
the majority of the company s long term debt consisted of bank borrowings 
during fiscal  million of variable rate industrial revenue bonds were issued and the resulting proceeds were loaned to the company to finance a portion of the company s capital projects in statesboro and san diego 
in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  which effectively converted million of its variable rate borrowings into a fixed rate obligation 
for fiscal  the company expects that outstanding borrowings will generally decline over the course of the year 
the company believes that cash from operating activities and the available credit facility provide adequate liquidity for the next months 
shareholders equity at march   apogee s shareholders equity stood at million  up from a year ago 
book value per share also rose to  up from per share a year ago  as outstanding common shares increased only nominally during the year 
net earnings and the proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock under our stock based compensation plans accounted for the increases  which were partly offset by dividends paid of per share and the repurchase of  shares of common stock 
market risks the company s principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage the company s direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of the company s balance sheet  primarily debt obligations  as well as market interest rates in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
the aforementioned changes in interest rates affecting the company s financial instruments would result in approximately a  impact to net earnings 
as interest rates increase  net earnings decrease  as interest rates decrease  net earnings increase 
the company uses interest swaps to fix a portion of its variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   the company has interest swaps covering million of variable rate debt 
the net present liability associated with these swaps is million at the end of fiscal the company has a policy of using forward exchange contracts to hedge its net exposures  by currency  related to the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  and future firm commitments of its operations 
forward exchange contracts are also used from time to time to manage near term foreign currency cash requirements 
the primary objective of these hedging activities is to maintain an approximately balanced position in foreign currencies so that exchange gains and losses resulting from exchange rate changes  net of related tax effects  are minimized 
given the company s balanced foreign exchange position described above  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these contracts are based would result in exchange losses from these contracts that would  in all material respects  be fully offset by exchange gains on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
as of march   the company did not have any forward contracts outstanding as the company had no material foreign exchange exposure 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
however  since the cost of many of our inventories is determined using the last in  first out lifo method of accounting  cost of sales  except for depreciation expense included therein  generally reflects current costs 
the cost of glass  one of our primary raw materials  was essentially flat compared with last year 
we expect the cost of glass to increase slightly in fiscal while our construction and supply contracts are at fixed prices  the material components are usually based on firm quotes obtained from suppliers 
labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits  rose in fiscal and a moderate increase also can be reasonably anticipated for fiscal other costs are managed to minimize the inflationary pressures that exist in markets for goods and services that apogee s business operations require
