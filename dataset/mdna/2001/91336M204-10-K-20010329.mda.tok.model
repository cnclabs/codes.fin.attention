factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
the following discussion provides information and analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december   and our liquidity and capital resources 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this yearly report as well as the reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we commenced operations on october  for the purpose of facilitating the provisioning  installation and servicing of dedicated communications circuits for service providers who buy network capacity and transport suppliers who sell network capacity 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from providing ongoing  dedicated circuit access 
monthly recurring circuit revenues are generated under client contracts with terms ranging from to months  with an average length of months as of december  contracts with our clients may be terminated by the client at any time  subject to additional payments 
circuit charges are billed monthly in advance  and circuit revenues are recognized in the month that service is provided 
amounts billed in advance are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable and unearned revenue 
at december   unearned revenue was million 
these access revenues include bundled charges for provisioning  network management and maintenance services 
utx billing and revenue recognition policies are the same as those described above for circuit access revenues 
at december   we had fifteen completed utx facilities  all of which had been placed into operations 
in addition to the fifteen operational utx facilities  we expect during to complete construction of sixteen smaller facilities  fourteen in north america and two in europe  for a total of thirty one utx facilities 
construction  equipment and facility leasing costs incurred in connection with the construction of a utx facility are capitalized until the facility is placed into operations 
once the facility is placed into operations  these costs are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease  ranging from seven to years  or the estimated useful life of the equipment 
at december  we had utx construction in process of million  and had entered into outstanding utx equipment orders of approximately million and minimum lease payments of approximately million related to utx facilities 
our clients are communications service providers and transport suppliers  such as internet service providers  competitive access providers  incumbent telecommunication service providers and other application and network service providers 
our largest client represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  our four largest clients represented approximately of total revenues for the year ended december  to date  cost of revenues has primarily consisted of amounts paid to transport suppliers for circuits 
we have negotiated volume discounts and network route specific discounts under contracts with many of our suppliers 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from three to ten years and include minimum monthly purchase commitments that begin anywhere from six to twelve months after we enter into the contract 
at december   these minimum purchase commitments totaled approximately million per month 
however  actual purchases under these contracts  which totaled approximately million for the month ended december   have exceeded these minimum purchase commitments 
in addition  as of december  we were currently party to contracts that will impose additional minimum purchase commitments that we anticipate will total approximately million per month by december operations and administration expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  costs associated with the development  expansion and maintenance of our universal information exchange uix databases  and costs associated with sales  marketing  operations  administration and facilities 
in each year since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and net losses  and have experienced negative cash flows from operations 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss    dividends on redeemable and nonredeemable cumulative convertible preferred stock  net loss applicable to common stockholders   basic and diluted net loss per share basic and diluted net loss per share excluding non cash stock option compensation expense shares used in computing net loss per share    results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit revenues in each of these years 
our utx facilities enable us to provision circuits more efficiently and therefore directly contribute to increases in circuit revenues 
the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater revenues per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
cost of circuit access cost of circuit access increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  cost of circuit access decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of circuit access in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold to both an increased number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the decrease in cost of circuit access as a percentage of total revenues was primarily attributable to volume pricing efficiencies created by the uix and reflects the successful scaling of our model and the growing efficiencies in our business 
operations and administration excluding stock option plan compensation operations and administration expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in personnel  continued expansion of our uix databases and the build out of our corporate infrastructure  including facilities  sales and marketing 
the number of employees increased from at december  to at december   which resulted in a significant increase in salaries and benefits expense during as a result of these significant headcount additions  we used external placement agencies to assist with our internal recruiting efforts  increasing placement fees by million to a total of million during we have projected headcount to grow to employees by december   with the majority of additions to be hired through our internal recruiting efforts  thereby  significantly decreasing placement fees incurred during additionally  during we expect revenue growth to continue to outpace overhead growth and anticipate average sg a expense to be  per employee per month for the year ended december  the cost of uix development personnel as well as non capitalized development costs associated with the uix increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  facilities costs  including rent and utilities for corporate offices and sales offices increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to the write down of certain assets  including goodwill and fixed assets  from our division  pacific crest networks pcn 
sales and marketing costs  primarily for tradeshows  advertising and promotions  increased million for the year ended december  during  we began operations in london and amsterdam to increase our presence in europe  incurring a loss from these start up operations of million in the current year 
we expect losses from our european operations to increase in the future  as we increase working capital requirements and build out our utx facilities 
we expect total operations and administration expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase personnel  expand the uix databases and build out corporate infrastructure 
ultimately  we expect operations and administration expense to significantly decrease as a percentage of revenues as we fully leverage our operating systems  our uix databases and our infrastructure 
operations and administration stock option plan compensation during fiscal year and the first quarter of  we granted stock options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the dates of grant 
these stock option issuances have resulted in stock option plan compensation charges  which are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
stock option compensation expense totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the substantial decrease in stock option plan compensation charges between periods is attributable to loans issued to three officers of the company in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this event resulted in a one time stock option compensation charge of million in the year ended december  there were  and  stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively 
we expect to recognize additional stock option plan compensation charges of approximately million over the next four years  which includes million of compensation charges related to a restricted stock award made in the first quarter of to certain executives and key employees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
depreciation expense increased by million in the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of six additional utx facilities placed into operations during the fourth quarter of as well as additional equipment purchases for existing utx facilities 
we expect depreciation expense to increase substantially in the future as we continue to place our utx facilities into service and purchase additional equipment for existing utx facilities 
amortization expense  which increased  during the year ended december   as compared to prior year  relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchases of pacific crest networks  inc  stuff software  inc and tri quad enterprises  inc 
in july  november and july  respectively 
other income expense other income totaled  and million for the years ended december  and december  the increase in other income was attributable to our investment of substantially all of the proceeds from our public stock offering  in cash equivalents with original maturities of less than three months and marketable securities with original maturities of three to six months 
interest income for the year ended december  was partially offset by interest expense on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
income taxes from our inception through september   we elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for income tax purposes 
on september   we converted to a c corporation 
at december   we had approximately  of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit has been recorded in our statement of operations 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis and adjust the valuation allowance based on this assessment 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards if there is a change in ownership  as defined  within any three year period 
the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to our capital stock transactions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit revenues in each of these years 
the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater revenues per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
cost of circuit access cost of circuit access increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of circuit access increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of circuit access in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater cost per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the increase in cost of circuit access as a percentage of revenues was in part attributable to the fact that we deliberately reduced our margins on certain high capacity circuits in an effort to attract large clients  and in part attributable to  of circuit charges incurred for circuits that were not immediately resold to clients 
operations and administration excluding stock option plan compensation operations and administration expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in operations and administration expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and continued expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
during the year ended december   we opened sales offices in vienna  virginia and san jose  california 
the number of our employees increased from at december  to at december  in addition  we incurred bad debt expense of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  approximately one half of the increase in bad debt expense related to one substantial client account  which represented over four months of billings 
we have revised our credit and collection procedures so that service is now discontinued within two months of non payment 
the remainder of the increase in bad debt expense was related to several smaller doubtful accounts 
finally  we sold series d preferred stock to certain professional service providers during for  less than the deemed fair market value of the stock at the date of sale 
operations and administration stock option plan compensation during  we recorded a total of million and during the year ended december   we recorded a total of million in deferred stock option plan compensation as a result of granting options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
deferred stock option plan compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
amortization expense totaled million for the year ended december  we expect to recognize additional deferred stock option plan compensation expense of approximately million over the next four years  based upon options outstanding at december  in addition  during the year ended december  we recorded million of stock option plan compensation expense  related to loans issued to three officers of the company  in connection with exercise of stock options 
depreciation depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
we expect depreciation expense to increase substantially in the future as we continue to place our utx facilities into service 
interest expense and interest income interest expense increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to additional borrowings under a term loan and line of credit facility used for general working capital requirements and to fund capital expenditures 
interest income increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to investing a portion of the proceeds from our series a  series b  series c  series d and series e preferred stock offerings in short term money market instruments 
income taxes from our inception through september   we elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for income tax purposes 
on september   we converted to a c corporation 
at december   we had approximately  of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit has been recorded in our statement of operations 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis and adjust the valuation allowance based on this assessment 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code of  as amended imposes annual limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards if there is a change in ownership  as defined  within any three year period 
the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to our capital stock transactions 
liquidity and capital resources on march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock that resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share 
net proceeds related to this offering totaled million 
until the time of our initial public offering  we had financed our operations primarily through private placements as well as through borrowings from stockholders and financial institutions 
since inception through december   we raised million in capital through private placements of common and convertible preferred stock and common and preferred stock warrants 
our principal uses of cash are to fund operating losses  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments with original maturities between three and six months 
on january   the company added  shares to its stock plan 
in accordance with the plan  the maximum aggregate number of shares of the company s common stock that may be optioned and sold is  shares  plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of the company s fiscal year beginning in equal to the lesser of i  shares  ii of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date  or iii a lesser amount determined by the board 
on january   the company added  shares to its employee stock purchase plan 
in accordance with the plan  the maximum number of shares of the company s common stock which shall be made available for sale shall be  shares plus an annual increase to be added on the first day of the company s fiscal year beginning in equal to the lesser of i  shares  ii of the outstanding shares of common stock on such date  or iii a lesser amount as determined by the board 
in march  we entered into a lease commitment for office space located in chicago  illinois which serves as our new corporate headquarters 
this commitment will result in lease payments of million during fiscal and million of future minimum lease payments through july in march  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank under which we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
the agreement provides that outstanding borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
this agreement expired in april and we do not intend to renew this line of credit 
the collateral cash balance in the amount of our outstanding letters of credit at december  was  and will expire april  in december  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank and borrowed million 
outstanding borrowings bear interest at approximately and are secured by specifically identified assets 
the agreement expires in november and requires that we maintain an unrestricted cash balance of at least million 
as of december   the outstanding balance of this loan was million 
in june  we entered into a credit agreement with a bank under which we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
the agreement expires in june and supercedes the credit agreement entered into in september the agreement consists of part a and part b 
under part a of the agreement we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
part a requires that we maintain a cash balance in a custodial account in an amount equal to the amount of borrowings and letters of credit outstanding up to million 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under part a of the agreement as of december  and a million cash balance was in a custodial account as of december  under part b of the agreement we may request the bank to issue letters of credit or we may borrow up to a total of million 
outstanding borrowings under the agreement bear interest at the bank s prime rate and are secured by substantially all of our assets 
part b of the agreement requires that we maintain specified covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under part b of the agreement as of december  net cash used in operating activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used was primarily due to increased net losses 
in december  we purchased million of equipment for deployment in our utx facilities 
this purchase was recorded within accounts payable at year end 
we are currently in the process of obtaining financing for this equipment and anticipate having this financing arranged by the end of the first quarter of net cash used in investing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities relates to the purchases of property and equipment  primarily for the construction of our utx facilities  and the purchase of tri quad and short term investments 
we expect to substantially increase our investments in facilities and equipment over the next year as we increase our number of utx facilities 
at december  we had fifteen completed utx facilities  all of which had been placed into operations 
in addition to these facilities we intend to complete construction of sixteen additional facilities during  for a total of thirty one utx facilities 
in we plan to spend approximately million to complete construction of sixteen smaller utx facilities fourteen in north america and two in europe  support the continued enhancement of our uix  upgrade utx facilities for additional service demands  and continue build out of sales and administrative offices 
the smaller utx facilities can range in size from square feet to  square feet and are less capital intensive than the facilities that are currently operational 
we will use part of the proceeds from our initial public stock offering  which occurred on march   for these capital expenditures  and do not anticipate needing additional outside funding in order to complete these projects 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of million from the public issuance of our common stock on march  we have invested these proceeds primarily in cash equivalents  with original maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities  with original maturities of between three and six months 
we intend to continue investing surplus cash in similar securities  however  we may invest in marketable securities with maturities of up to eighteen months 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our services  the resources we devote to developing  selling and marketing our services and the rate at which we expand our utx facilities 
in addition  we plan to continue to evaluate possible investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies 
although we believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering in march  together with existing cash balances  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least until we become self funding through operations  we may require additional financing within this time frame 
additional funding may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k and the company s other reports filed with the sec  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception  and if we fail to increase our revenues  we will be unable to achieve and maintain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses in the future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although our revenues have grown from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   we cannot be certain that our revenues will continue to grow  or that we will achieve sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing expenses in order to expand sales and marketing activities to increase market acceptance  expand our operational activities to further develop our business model  expand our administrative organization to support the anticipated growth of our business  expand and enhance our uix databases  and build out our utx facilities 
as a result  we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we fail to generate higher revenues  we may continue to incur operating losses and net losses 
our limited operating history makes forecasting difficult 
we have a limited operating history and  therefore  limited meaningful historical financial data upon which to base our planned operating expenses 
specifically  our utx business model is relatively new  and we have not operated our uix databases in conjunction with our utx facilities long enough to accurately predict trends in our business 
moreover  we have not built out enough utx facilities to be able to test whether our strategy to utilize these facilities will work 
accordingly  we are subject to all of the risks that are associated with companies in an emerging industry and in an early stage of development  including undercapitalization  cash shortages  the unproven nature of our business model  the new and unproven nature of the market for our services  the need to make significant expenditures and incur significant expenses as we develop our business  infrastructure and operations  the lack of sufficient clients and revenues to sustain our operations and growth without additional financing  difficulties in managing growth  and limited experience in providing some of the services that we offer or plan to offer 
for example  from time to time we enter into long term agreements with communications transport suppliers for the supply and installation of communications network capacity 
these agreements generally provide for monthly minimum revenue commitments from us  which we must negotiate based on forecasts of our future network capacity requirements 
as of december   we were party to contracts that will impose minimum purchase commitments that we anticipate will total approximately million per month by december if we fail to forecast our network capacity requirements accurately or fail to accurately forecast other aspects of our business  it will be difficult for us to become profitable 
we have an unproven business model  and we cannot be sure that clients will widely accept our services 
our business strategy is unproven 
to be successful  we must convince prospective clients to entrust their network capacity data and transport requirements to a company without a long and proven track record 
we are not aware of any companies that have a directly comparable business  and we cannot be sure that clients will widely accept our services 
our ability to expand our client base may be limited by the following factors the speed  reliability and cost effectiveness of our services  the willingness of clients to outsource the obtaining of circuits  our ability to market our services effectively  and the growth of the internet 
we may not be able to execute our business model if the markets for our services fail to develop or grow more slowly than anticipated  if competitors enter the market or if we are unable to expand our client base 
our ability to implement and maintain our uix databases is unproven 
if we cannot increase the scope and accuracy of these databases as planned  our ability to cost effectively facilitate the obtaining of circuits for our clients will be at risk 
to be successful  we must increase and update information about pricing  capacity  availability and location of circuits contained in our databases 
our ability to cost effectively facilitate the supplying of circuits and to provide ongoing dedicated line circuit access depends upon the information we collect from our transport suppliers regarding their networks  which we include in our uix databases 
our suppliers are not obligated to provide us with this information and could decide to stop providing this information to us at any time 
moreover  we cannot be certain that the information that our suppliers share with us is completely accurate or current 
if we cannot continue to maintain and expand our uix databases as planned  we may be unable to increase our revenues or to cost effectively facilitate the supplying of the circuits  and we may never achieve profitability 
the market for our utx services is new and unproven  and we have limited experience providing our utx services 
the market for our utx services is new and unproven 
our ability to generate revenues will suffer if the market for these services fails to develop  or develops more slowly than we expect 
the growth of this market depends on several uncertain events or occurrences including our ability to remain a neutral intermediary between transport suppliers and the willingness of these suppliers to install their equipment in our utx facilities  our ability to successfully and cost effectively market our services to a sufficiently large number of clients  and the increased need for high speed communications network services 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from providing on going circuit access  and we have only limited experience providing our utx services 
at december   we had operational utx facilities in atlanta  chicago  dallas  los angeles  miami  new york city locations  phoenix  portland  san francisco  santa clara  seattle  washington dc  and vienna  virginia 
however  clients may terminate their utx contracts at any time  and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we fail to maintain our existing clients and to attract new clients for our utx services 
one of our key strategies is to expand our business by opening additional utx facilities in geographically diverse locations 
in addition to our fifteen operational utx facilities  we expect to construct sixteen additional smaller utx facilities in the united states during  for a total of completed utx sites 
construction of utx facilities is expensive and time consuming and will cause a significant strain on the capital resources and operation of our business 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient funds  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our development and expansion plans 
a delay in the expansion of our utx facilities may make it more difficult for us to respond to competitive pressures and establish our presence in the market 
it usually takes us at least six months to select an appropriate location for a new utx facility  construct the facility  install equipment and communications network infrastructure and hire operations and sales personnel 
we must incur these costs before we have clients who purchase our services to be delivered from the utx facilities 
if the demand does not develop as we anticipate  we will have fixed costs without corresponding revenue and our business will be harmed 
our ability to open utx facilities is subject to a number of risks  including the following the availability of appropriate space for these facilities on reasonable terms  competition for limited space in desirable locations from large  well capitalized companies that may be more attractive tenants for potential landlords  construction delays  cost overruns  equipment and material delays  and inability to obtain necessary permits on a timely basis 
in addition  our costs will increase as we continue to open utx facilities 
these increased costs include leasing additional real estate  expenses associated with hiring  training and managing new employees  purchasing new equipment  implementing power and redundancy systems  implementing multiple communications connections  and depreciation expense 
an inability to establish additional utx facilities as planned  to effectively manage our expansion or to attract sufficient clients to our utx facilities would harm our ability to generate revenues 
if we cannot successfully aggregate circuits  this could limit our ability to increase our margins 
we plan to actively manage circuits through our utx facilities to deliver circuits to customers more quickly and to increase margins 
we plan to achieve this by physically aggregating circuits on the same route 
in order to physically aggregate circuits  we plan to deploy optical switches that would allow circuits to be optically switched between networks 
however  we have not tested optical switches in our utx facilities  and we cannot be sure that this equipment will function as expected 
we may also face delays in installing optical switches 
in addition  we cannot be sure that there will be enough circuits on routes between existing utx facilities to allow us to cost effectively aggregate these circuits 
if we cannot successfully deploy optical switches or physically aggregate circuits  this could limit our ability to increase our margins 
if we cannot successfully operate our network operations center  we will be unable to provide monitoring  maintenance and restoration services to our clients 
one of our primary business objectives is to provide our clients with network monitoring  maintenance and restoration services hours a day  seven days a week through a network operations center 
we recently began operating a network operations facility  however  we have only limited experience implementing services of this type 
as a consequence  we cannot be sure that our efforts to provide these services will be successful 
our ability to implement this strategy will depend on many factors  including our ability to train  manage and retain employees 
if we fail to successfully operate a network operations center  we may not be able to monitor network operations effectively or troubleshoot circuits in a cost effective manner  which would cause us to lose clients and make it difficult for us to attract new clients 
although we plan to continue expanding international operations  we have limited experience operating internationally 
an important component of our strategy is to expand into international markets  such as europe  asia and south america  and we recently opened offices in london  england  and amsterdam  the netherlands 
however  we have limited experience operating internationally 
the risks inherent in conducting our business internationally include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and trade barriers  unexpected changes in national and international including european union and world trade organization regulatory requirements and trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  differences in technology standards  employment laws and practices in foreign countries  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  inability to obtain access to transport capacity  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and imposition of currency exchange controls  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  in order to expand internationally  we may enter into joint ventures or outsourcing agreements with third parties  acquire complementary businesses or operations  or establish and maintain new operations outside of the united states 
we may not control or manage some or all of these operations 
as a result  we may be required to depend on third parties for the management of these international operations 
if these foreign operations are not successful  they could significantly damage our reputation  which would harm our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients 
competition in our industry is intense and growing  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for the services we provide is highly fragmented 
in addition  the market in which we operate is new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
we believe that at this time no single competitor competes directly with us with respect to all of the services we offer  however  we currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies  including some of our transport suppliers  with respect to our products and services individually  including national and local carriers  such as at t  broadwing  qwest  sprint  worldcom and williams communications  companies that provide collocation facilities  such as abovenet communications mfn  at t  colo 
com  equinix  exodus communications  global center  and layer one companies that engage in bandwidth trading  resale  and arbitrage of circuit connectivity such as arbinet  bandwidth 
com  enron  and rateexchange  competitive access providers  such as at t  eli  icg communications  worldcom  xo communications  fibernet  pathnet  and telseon  and incumbent local exchange carriers  such as verizon  bellsouth and sbc communications 
we expect to face additional competition from new market entrants in the future as there are few substantial barriers to entry in our market 
significant new competitors could arise from increased consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry 
other new entrants could enter the market with a business model similar to ours 
our target markets may support only a limited number of competitors 
operations in such markets with multiple competitive providers may be unprofitable for one or more of such providers 
prices in both the long distance business and the data transmission business have declined significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
moreover  while recent regulatory initiatives allow carriers such as us to interconnect with incumbent local exchange carrier facilities and to obtain unbundled network elements from incumbent local exchange carriers  certain initiatives also provide increased pricing flexibility for  and relaxation of regulatory oversight of  the incumbent local exchange carrier 
this may present incumbent local exchange carriers with an opportunity to subsidize services that compete with our services with revenues generated from non competitive services 
this would allow incumbent local exchange carriers to offer competitive services at lower prices 
existing laws also restrict the regional bell operating companies from fully competing with us in the market for interstate and international long distance telecommunications services  but also permit the federal communications commission  the fcc  to lessen or remove some restrictions 
if fcc decisions under existing law  or future amendments to federal telecommunications laws  permit the regional bell operating companies to compete fully with us in this market  our revenues from these services could be reduced if these companies are able to attract a substantial portion of our customers 
we must distinguish ourselves through the quality of our client service  our service offerings and brand name recognition 
we may not be successful in doing this 
many of our potential competitors have certain advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  including brand or corporate name recognition  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  and more established relationships in the industry 
our competitors may be able to use these advantages to expand their offerings more quickly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  enter into strategic relationships to rapidly grow the reach of their networks and capacity  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services  and adopt more aggressive pricing and incentive policies  which could drive down margins 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  our gross margins could decline and we could lose market share  either of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we have difficulties or delays in delivering circuits to our clients  our ability to generate revenue will suffer and we may lose existing and potential new clients 
it typically takes to days to supply a circuit for a client  and we do not begin to recognize revenue until a circuit has been installed and accepted by the client 
once we agree to facilitate the supply of a circuit for a client  we negotiate with one or more transport suppliers and manage the personnel and field technicians of multiple vendors 
a client can withdraw its order with minimal liability at any time before accepting the circuit 
we may experience difficulties in facilitating the supply of circuits if our transport suppliers run out of capacity  forcing us to look for alternative sources of capacity on short notice 
if we are unable to facilitate the supply of a circuit in a timely manner or fail to obtain client acceptance of the circuit  we will be unable to recognize access revenues for that circuit  and our operating results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  since our clients may cancel orders at any time before accepting the circuit  we may find it difficult to forecast revenue and plan our expenses accordingly 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which we cannot control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
these factors include the following uncertainty regarding timing for supplying circuits or failure to obtain client acceptance of circuits  timing of the completion of new utx facilities  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  decisions by existing clients not to renew services on a timely basis when existing client contracts terminate  the amount of unused circuit capacity that we hold  general economic conditions as well as those specific to the internet and related industries  internet growth and demand for internet infrastructure  and labor issues with our suppliers 
in addition  we depend on decisions by our clients to expand their internet infrastructure  which in turn depend upon the success and expected demand for the services these clients offer 
we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term due in large part to our construction of our utx facilities 
as a result  fluctuations in our revenue for the reasons set forth above  or for any other reason  could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
because of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not  and will not be  a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock may fall 
our facilities and the networks on which we depend may fail  which would interrupt the circuit access we provide and make it difficult for us to retain and attract clients 
our clients depend on our ability to provide ongoing dedicated circuit access 
the operation of these circuits depends on the networks of third party transport suppliers  such as mci worldcom or williams communications 
the networks of transport suppliers and clients who may use our utx facilities may be interrupted by failures in or damage to these facilities 
our facilities and the ongoing circuit access we provide may be interrupted as a result of various events  many of which we cannot control  including fire  human error  earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  train derailments or similar disasters along communications rights of way  power loss  telecommunications failures  or sabotage or vandalism 
we may be subject to legal claims and be liable for losses suffered by our clients for disruptions to circuits or damage to client equipment resulting from failures at our facilities or on the networks of third party providers 
in addition  we may be subject to legal claims and be liable for losses suffered by clients and carriers who use our utx facilities 
our contracts with our clients and with carriers who use our utx facilities attempt to eliminate our liability for consequential or punitive damages and for damage to client equipment not caused by our gross negligence or willful acts 
however  those provisions may not protect us from being held liable for those damages 
we generally provide outage credits to our clients if circuit disruptions occur 
if our circuit failure rate is high  we may incur significant expenses related to circuit outage credits  which would reduce our revenues 
we would also incur significant expenses in investigating and addressing the causes of such circuit failures  which would divert resources from the expansion of our services and cause our business to suffer 
clients may seek to terminate their contracts with us if there is a circuit failure 
in addition  if our circuit failure rate is high  our reputation could be harmed  which would make it difficult for us to retain and attract clients 
we depend on several large clients  and the loss of one or more of these clients  or a significant decrease in total revenues from any of these clients  could significantly reduce our revenue and income 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has come from a limited number of clients 
for example  for the year ended december   our largest client accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and for the year ended december   our four largest clients accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we have a number of significant revenue contracts with these customers 
these contracts expire on various dates between november and march if we lose one or more large clients  or if one or more of our large clients reduces the services they purchase from us and we fail to add new clients  our revenues could decline and our results of operations would suffer 
our clients may fail to pay or be unable to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner or at all 
some of our clients may have limited operating histories and may have inadequate financial resources to meet all of their obligations 
we recorded a substantial bad debt expense during the year ended december  primarily in connection with the failure by one of our clients to pay its bills 
although we continue to improve our credit approval process  if other clients are unable to meet their obligations to us  we may incur additional bad debt expenses  which could harm our cash flows and results of operations 
the regulatory framework under which we operate and new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing regulatory requirements could require substantial time and resources for compliance  which could make it difficult for us to operate our business 
our communications services are subject to both federal and state regulation 
in providing our interstate and international communications services  we must comply with federal telecommunications laws and regulations prescribed by the fcc 
at the state level  we are subject to state laws and to regulation by state public utility commissions 
as we expand internationally  we will also become subject to regulation by foreign authorities and  in some markets  supra national authorities  such as the european union 
these laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes and different interpretations  and therefore  it is difficult for us to assess the impact of these factors on our operations 
the current domestic and international trend is toward deregulation of telecommunications and internet services 
however  we cannot be certain that this trend will continue  and it is possible that changes in regulatory policies could limit our ability to compete in some markets 
the implementation  modification  interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations vary and can limit our ability to provide many of our services 
we have been required to obtain authorization from the fcc and many state public utilities commissions to offer particular types of telecommunications services 
pursuant to these authorizations  we have to comply with a variety of regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis 
we cannot assure you that the fcc or state commissions will grant us required authority or do so in a timely manner  or refrain from taking action against us if we are found to have violated any requirements of their rules 
if authority is not obtained or if our schedules of prices  terms  and conditions are not filled  or are not updated  or otherwise do not fully comply with the rules of the fcc or state regulatory agencies  third parties or regulators could challenge our ability to offer our services 
such challenges could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses 
required regulatory approvals may interfere with or delay corporate transactions 
as a regulated company  we are required to obtain the approval of the fcc and certain state regulators before engaging in certain types of transactions  including mergers  acquisitions of other regulated companies  sales of all or substantial parts of our business  issuance of stock  and incurrence of debt obligations 
the particular types of transactions that require approval differ in each jurisdiction 
in several states  any transaction that results in a transfer of or more of our voting stock may require prior approval 
if we cannot obtain the required approvals  or if we encounter substantial delays in obtaining them  we may not be able to enter into transactions on favorable terms and our flexibility in operating our business will be limited 
if our flexibility is limited  we may not be able to optimize our operating results 
telecommunications regulations of other countries may restrict our operations 
we will be subject to the regulatory regimes in each of the countries in which we conduct business 
local regulations range from permissive to restrictive  depending upon the country 
changes to existing regulations of foreign countries may decrease the opportunities that are available for us to enter into those markets  or may increase our legal  administrative or operational costs  or may constrain our activities in other ways that we cannot necessarily anticipate 
any of these developments could impair our efforts to develop foreign operations 
we expect to incur operational and management inefficiencies when we acquire new businesses 
part of our expansion strategy includes acquiring businesses and technologies that we believe will complement our existing business 
for example  in we acquired two companies  in july we completed our third acquisition  and we may acquire additional companies in the future 
these acquisitions will likely involve some or all of the following risks difficulty of assimilating acquired operations and personnel and information systems  potential disruption of our ongoing business  diversion of resources  possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible difficulty of managing our growth  risks of entering markets in which we have little experience  and potential impairment of relationships with employees or clients 
we may need to complete these transactions in order to remain competitive 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain required financing for these transactions or that these transactions will occur 
we expect to require additional third party financing  and if we cannot obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to expand our business will suffer 
although we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to fund our business until we become self funding through operations  our ability to meet our planned growth may require substantial cash resources 
we expect that the anticipated expansion of our utx facilities  construction of sixteen additional facilities in the year at an estimated average cost of  to million per facility  and our anticipated funding of negative cash flow from operating activities  will require substantial capital 
in addition  part of our expansion strategy includes acquiring complementary businesses and technology  which may require us to raise additional funds 
we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from operations in the near term 
accordingly  our ability to meet our additional future capital needs will depend upon our ability to renegotiate  extend or replace our credit facilities  obtain supplemental financing or raise additional capital 
additional debt financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
we may not be able to renegotiate or replace our credit and equipment lease facilities on a timely basis  on acceptable terms or at all 
additional equity financing may not be available or may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain future financing when needed or on acceptable terms we may have to delay or abandon our development and expansion plans  which could materially adversely affect our growth and ability to compete 
we must expand our marketing and sales operations substantially to increase market awareness and sales of our services 
our services require a sophisticated sales effort that targets key people within our prospective clients organizations 
this sales effort requires the efforts of select personnel as well as specialized system and consulting engineers within our organization 
we have recently expanded our sales force and plan to hire additional marketing and sales personnel  and system and consulting engineers  particularly individuals with experience in the telecommunications industry 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the number of qualified sales personnel and system and consulting engineers we need 
in addition  we may substantially increase our budget as part of our marketing program 
if we are unable to expand our marketing and sales operations  or our marketing efforts are not successful  we may not be able to increase market awareness or sales of our products and services  which may prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
if we do not continue to expand our client support organization substantially  clients may significantly reduce purchases of our services 
we recently hired a number of additional personnel for our client support organization and will need to continue to increase our staff to support new clients and the expanding needs of existing clients 
our client support organization is responsible for providing our clients with technical and operational support  and for identifying and developing opportunities to provide additional services to our existing clients 
competition for qualified client support personnel is intense because few people have the necessary level of technical skills and experience in telecommunications provisioning and network management 
if we fail to further expand our client support organization  we may be limited in our ability to gain more business from existing clients  and we may be unable to obtain or maintain current information regarding our clients and suppliers communications networks  which could limit our ability to provision future circuits for our clients 
if we do not establish and maintain key client relationships  our revenues may decline 
our success will depend upon our ability to develop and manage key client relationships in order to generate additional revenues from existing clients 
our ability to develop and manage our client relationships depends on  among other things our ability to maintain the timeliness and quality of our services in facilitating the supply of circuits  our ability to deliver our clients additional services  such as network monitoring  maintenance and troubleshooting services  our ability to expand our client support organization with additional  qualified personnel  and performance by the transport suppliers with whom we contract to provide circuits to our clients 
if we fail to establish and maintain these client relationships  our revenues may stagnate or decline 
if we fail to manage expansion effectively  our ability to increase our services and client base could suffer 
our ability to successfully offer our services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management 
we continue to increase the scope of our operations and have substantially increased the number of our employees 
at december   we had five employees while at december   we had approximately full time employees 
in addition  we plan to continue to hire a significant number of employees 
this growth has placed  and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures  and will need to continue to expand  train and manage our work force 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various clients  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively 
if we fail to successfully complete the implementation of our management information systems  we may not be able to operate or manage our business effectively 
we are in the process of augmenting our management information systems to facilitate management of client orders  client service  billing and financial applications 
our ability to manage our business could be harmed if we fail to successfully and promptly implement all applications of our management information systems  integrate all the client records and the billing  ordering  inventory  management  accounting and other financial information systems of the businesses we have acquired or may acquire into our management information systems  identify all of our information and processing needs  repair bugs and design defects that may exist in our management information systems  implement a wide area network connecting our main offices and our utx facilities in different geographic locations  or maintain and upgrade our management information systems as necessary 
in addition  our ability to efficiently operate our business could suffer if the software which runs our information systems malfunctions 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively in a rapidly changing market  and our ability to generate revenues will suffer if we are unable to retain our key personnel and hire additional personnel 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
in addition  we depend on the ability of a relatively new management team to effectively execute our strategies 
we recently hired several of our key employees 
because some members of our management team have worked together only for a short period of time  we need to integrate these officers into our operations 
we will need to hire additional personnel in our communications provisioning  sales  marketing and support areas in the future  and we believe our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain these key employees 
competition for these persons is intense  especially in the communications provisioning area 
in particular  we have experienced difficulty in hiring qualified network engineers  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining these individuals 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel could limit our ability to generate revenues 
because we have no patented technology and have limited ability to protect our proprietary information  competitors may more easily enter our market and harm our ability to generate revenues 
we have no patented technology that would preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our market 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  service mark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
we have applied for registration of certain of our service marks in the united states and in other countries  and have obtained a registration for one of our service marks in switzerland 
even if additional registrations are granted  we may be limited in the scope of services for which we may exclusively use our service marks 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and partners  and we control access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated or a third party may independently develop similar intellectual property 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
unauthorized use of any of our proprietary information could expose us to competition  which would harm our ability to attract new and existing clients and generate revenues 
certain stockholders will continue to have substantial control over universal access  inc and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control 
internet capital group  inc  funds affiliated with comventures and other stockholders  directors and officers  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  acting alone or together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
provisions of our charter documents may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in corporate control 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be a benefit to our stockholders 
there may be sales of a substantial amount of our common stock that could cause our stock price to fall 
our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock  substantially all of which they are able to sell in the public market 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or market expectations that these sales may occur could cause our stock price to fall 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise necessary capital to issue additional common stock 
we expect to experience volatility in the trading of our stock  which could negatively affect its value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of internet related companies  announcements by us or our competitors of new products and services or of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  any loss of a major customer  additions or departures of key personnel  any deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by securities analysts  future sales of common stock  and volume fluctuations  which are particularly common among highly volatile securities of internet related companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in cash equivalents and short term investments  except for a million long term minority investment 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in a portfolio comprised of commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade debt securities 
as of december   all of our investments had maturities of less than six months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
exchange rate sensitivity we currently operate primarily in the united states  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses to date have been in us dollars 
accordingly  we have had no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
