item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since commencement of biotransplant s operations in  we have been engaged primarily in the research and development of pharmaceutical products and systems to enable the body s immune system to better tolerate the transplantation of foreign cells  tissues and organs 
the major sources of our working capital have been the proceeds from sales of equity securities  sponsored research funding and license fees  capital lease financings and borrowings under a term loan 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products to date  and do not expect to receive any product revenues for several years  if ever 
we will be required to conduct significant additional research  development  testing and regulatory compliance activities that  together with general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years 
from through october  we were a party to two collaboration agreements with novartis to research  develop and commercialize xenotransplantation products 
during the collaboration  we received an aggregate of million in research funding and million in license fees and milestone payments from novartis 
in september  we entered into an arrangement with novartis to combine our respective expertise in the field of xenotransplantation into a newly formed  independently run swiss company  immerge biotherapeutics ag  which began operations in january  and terminated our prior collaborations in xenotransplantation 
novartis has committed to provide an aggregate of million in research funding over three years to the joint venture 
both we and novartis have exclusively licensed to the joint venture patent rights and technology in the field of xenotransplantation 
the joint venture has granted to novartis an exclusive  worldwide royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize any xenotransplantation products resulting from the joint venture s research 
we will receive royalties from the sale of xenotransplantation products by novartis  if any 
in december  immerge biotherapeutics ag formed a wholly owned delaware subsidiary  immerge biotherapeutics  inc we expect to enter into a contract research agreement with the delaware subsidiary  under which we will commit approximately full time employees to perform research and will agree to provide administrative services  all at a rate to be agreed upon 
novartis holds of the shares of the joint venture and we hold the remaining 
all income  gain  profit or loss of the joint venture will be allocated to us and novartis pro rata based upon our respective equity ownership of the joint venture in effect in the period in which these items accrue 
initially  the board of directors of immerge biotherapeutics  inc will consist of four directors one selected by biotransplant  one selected by novartis and two additional directors  one each designated by biotransplant and novartis  who are experts in the field of xenotransplantation 
immerge biotherapeutics ag has agreed not to undertake  or permit its subsidiaries to undertake  specified fundamental corporate actions without the consent of both shareholders 
in october  we entered into a collaborative research agreement with medimmune for the development of products to treat and prevent organ rejection 
medimmune paid us a million license fee at the time of execution of the agreement  and agreed to fund and assume responsibility for clinical testing and commercialization of the bti monoclonal antibody and other related products 
medimmune has provided million of non refundable research support and has agreed to make milestone payments which could total up to an additional million 
any milestone payments which are received are repayable from royalties on the bti monoclonal antibody and other related products 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily due to million in sponsored research payments received under the novartis agreement in  compared to million in sponsored research payments  milestone payments and license revenue received under the novartis agreement during research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased levels of external research support 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in our general corporate expenditures in compared to interest income increased to million in from  in the increase was due primarily to higher cash balances available for investment purposes as well as rising interest rates 
as a result of the above factors  we generated a net loss in of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in years ended december  and revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to million in sponsored research  milestone payments and license revenue from the novartis agreements in  compared to million in sponsored research and license revenue from novartis during research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to additional external research support combined with increases in research and development staff and associated increases in supplies and support services 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased outside professional services rendered in connection with market research and business development 
interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was due to lower average cash balances available for investment during as a result of the above factors  we incurred a net loss in of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth unaudited selected operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two years ended december  we believe that the following selected quarterly information includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal  recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary to present this information fairly

 in thousands  except per share amounts revenue        operating expenses         net loss        basic and diluted net loss per common share liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our operations have been funded principally through the net proceeds of an aggregate of million from sales of equity securities 
we have also received million from research and development and collaboration agreements with novartis  million from an alliance agreement with medimmune and million in equipment financing 
the proceeds of the sales of equity securities  equipment financing and cash generated from the corporate collaborations with novartis and medimmune have been used to fund operating losses of approximately million and the investment of approximately million in equipment and leasehold improvements through december  during  we extended and increased our term note with a bank from  to million for certain equipment and fixtures borrowing 
there were  in borrowings outstanding under this term note at december  we had no significant commitments as of december  for capital expenditures 
on february   we issued and sold to a group of investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million 
we have entered into sponsored research and consulting agreements with certain hospitals  academic institutions and consultants  requiring periodic payments by us 
aggregate minimum funding obligations under these agreements  each of which includes cancellation provisions  total approximately million  which includes approximately million in we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of december  as compared to million as of december  assuming the eligix merger is consummated  we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements as currently planned through the middle of we will need to raise substantial additional funds in the near term  and may seek to raise these funds through additional financings  including public or private equity offerings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or a combination of any of the foregoing 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product development programs or to license to others the right to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves  any of which would have a material and adverse effect on us 
even if we are able to raise the substantial additional funds required to finance our operations  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
factors that may affect this variability include  without limitation the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical and clinical testing  changes in existing and potential relationships with corporate collaborators  the time and cost in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  our ability to establish development and commercialization capacities or relationships  and the costs of manufacturing 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to research and development activities  preclinical studies  clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and the expansion of our facilities
