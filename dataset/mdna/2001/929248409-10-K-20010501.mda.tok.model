the prices of silver  gold  and palladium ar e subject to fluctuations and are expected to continue to be affected by worl d market conditions 
nonetheless  h h has not experienced any problem in obtainin g the necessary quantities of raw materials and  in the normal course of business receives precious metals from suppliers and customers 
these metals ar e returnable in fabricated or commercial bar form under agreed upon terms 
sinc e precious metals are fungible  h h does not physically segregate supplier an d customer metals from its own inventories 
therefore  to the extent that supplie r or customer metals are used by h h  the amount of inventory which h h must ow n is reduced 
all precious metal raw materials are readily available from severa l sources 
it is h h s operating policy to maintain its precious metal inventor y levels under the last in  first out lifo method of accounting 
preciou s metals are purchased at the same prices and quantities as selling commitments t o customers 
from time to time  management reviews the appropriate inventor y levels and may elect to make adjustments 
the raw materials used by h h in its non precious metal operation s consist principally of stainless  galvanized  and carbon steel  nickel alloys  a variety of high performance alloys  and various plastic compositions

the wpc group sells it s excess coke and coke oven by products to third party trade customers 
the wpc group s operations require material amounts of other ra w materials  including limestone  oxygen  natural gas and electricity 
these ra w materials are readily available and are purchased on the open market 
the wp c group is presently dependent on external steel scrap for approximately o f its steel melt 
the cost of these materials has been susceptible in the past t o price fluctuations  but worldwide competition in the steel industry ha s frequently limited the ability of steel producers to raise finished produc t prices to recover higher material costs 
certain of the wpc group s raw materia l supply contracts provide for price adjustments in the event of increase d commodity or energy prices 
backlog unimast order backlog at december  was approximately  tons  as compared to  tons at december  h h has no material backlog 
the wpc group s order backlog was  net tons at december  compared to  net tons at december  all orders related t o the backlog at december  are expected to be shipped during the firs t half of  subject to delays at the customers request 
the order backlo g represents orders received but not yet completed or shipped 
in times of stron g demand  a higher order backlog may allow the company to increase productio n runs  thereby enhancing production efficiencies 
capital investments the company believes that its operating business segments mus t continuously strive to improve productivity and product quality  and contro l manufacturing costs  in order to remain competitive 
accordingly  the company s business segments are committed to making necessary capital investments with th e objective of reducing overall manufacturing costs  improving the quality o f products produced and broadening the array of products offered to the company s several markets

h h capital expenditure s included in this total are for to  reflecting whx s acquisitio n in this level of capital expenditures was needed to maintain productiv e capacity  improve productivity and upgrade selected facilities to mee t competitive requirements and maintain compliance with environmental laws an d regulations 
the company anticipates funding its capital expenditures for th e whx group in from cash on hand  funds generated by operations and fund s available under the revolving credit facilities at h h and unimast 
the company anticipates that capital expenditure s for h h and unimast will approximate depreciation  on average  over the next fe w years 
the whx group has no obligation to fund any of the wpc group s future capital expenditures  and does not anticipate doing so 
the wpc grou p anticipates that it will fund its capital expenditures in from cash o n hand  funds generated by operations and funds available under the dip credi t agreement 
it is anticipated that capital expenditures will be minimized durin g the chapter proceedings until liquidity is sufficient and stabilized 
ther e can be no assurance that such funds will be sufficient to fund required capita l expenditures 
the wpc group s capital expenditures including capitalize d interest for were approximately million  including million o n environmental projects 
from to such expenditures aggregate d approximately million 
in the event that the wpc group is unable to fun d its environmental capital expenditures  claims may be made against whx fo r payment of such costs 
energy requirements many of the company s major facilities at both the whx group and th e wpc group that use natural gas have been equipped to use alternative fuels during  coal constituted approximately of the wpc group s total energ y consumption  natural gas and electricity 
the company continuall y monitors its operations regarding potential equipment conversion and fue l substitution to reduce energy costs

competition handy harman h h is one of the leading fabricators of precious metal products an d precision electroplating 
although there are no companies in the precious metal s field whose operations exactly parallel those of h h in every area  there are a number of competitors in each of the classes of precious metals products 
man y of these competitors also conduct activities in other product lines in which h h is not involved 
competition is based on quality  service and price  each o f which is of equal importance 
there are many companies  domestic and foreign  which manufactur e non precious wire and tubing products  and other specialty products of the typ e manufactured by h h 
competition is based on quality  service  price and ne w product introduction  each of which is of equal importance

wpc group the steel industry is cyclical in nature and has been marke d historically by overcapacity  resulting in intense competition 
wpc face s increasing competitive pressures from other domestic integrated producers minimills and processors 
processors compete with wpc in the areas of slitting cold rolling and coating 
minimills are generally smaller volume steel producer s that use ferrous scrap metals as their basic raw material 
compared t o integrated producers  minimills  which rely on less capital intensive stee l production methods  have certain advantages 
since minimills typically are no t unionized  they have more flexible work rules that have resulted in lowe r employment costs per net ton shipped 
since  significant flat rolle d minimill capacity has been constructed and these minimills now compete wit h integrated producers in product areas that traditionally have not face d significant competition from minimills 
in addition  there has been significan t additional flat rolled minimill capacity constructed in recent years 
thes e minimills and processors compete with wpc primarily in the commodity flat rolle d steel market 
in the long term  such minimills and processors may also compet e with wpc in producing value added products 
in addition  the increase d competition in commodity product markets influence certain integrated producer s to increase product offerings to compete with wpc s custom products 
as the single largest steel consuming country in the western world the united states has long been a favorite market of steel producers in europ e and japan 
in addition  steel producers from korea  taiwan  and brazil  an d other large economies such as russia and china  have also recognized the unite d states as a target market 
steel imports of flat rolled products as a percentag e of domestic apparent consumption  excluding semi finished steel  have bee n approximately in  in  in and in import s surged in due to severe economic conditions in southeast asia  lati n america  japan and russia  among others 
average import customs values i n december continued to be depressed with the average import value of som e key finished steel products below values reported in the depths of the crisis 
world steel demand  world export prices  us dollar exchange rates an d the international competitiveness of the domestic steel industry have all bee n factors in these import levels 
total annual steel consumption in the united states has fluctuate d between million and slightly over million tons since a number o f steel substitutes  including plastics  aluminum  composites and glass  hav e reduced the growth of domestic steel consumption

the wpc group ma y not be able to comply with the covenants in the dip credit agreement  o the wpc group s overall long term operationa l reorganization and financial restructuring plan may fail  o the wpc group s results of operations are sensitive t o steel prices realized in the market  and the continuation of steel prices a t current levels would continue to have a material adverse effect on the wp c group s business  o the wpc group s business requires that it expen d substantial capital to maintain its productivity and facilities 
terms of th e dip credit agreement and cash flow may not permit such expenditures  o the costs of complying with environmental standard s continues to increase and the wpc group may be unable to meet such costs  in th e event that wpc group is unable to fund these costs  claims may be made agains t whx for payment of such costs  o the steel industry is very competitive  and the wp c group faces competition from both foreign and domestic producers who may hav e lower operating costs  more modern facilities and greater access to capital  o the wpc group may suffer an inability to attract an d retain qualified personnel  and o there may occur a further decline in the genera l economic and business conditions and industry trends affecting the stee l industry 
outcomes management of the company cannot determine with certainty th e ultimate outcome of the chapter proceedings  however  it is reasonabl y possible that the following outcomes could result o the wpc group could reorganize  and thei r creditors could receive all or a portion of thei r claims 
o the wpc group could be sold in its entirety o r segments could be sold  and the proceeds from suc h sale s would be utilized to satisfy credito r claims 
o the creditors could assume ownership of the wp c group and continue to operate the wpc grou p businesses 
in each of the above possible outcomes  the whx group would hav e little or no future ownership in or involvement with the wpc group  and the wh x group future cash obligations to or on behalf of the wpc group would be minima l to none other than the payment of the disputed inter company account to the wp c group  payments that may be required pursuant to the terms of the tax sharin g agreement and any payment that may result under the company s guarantee of th e term loan portion of the dip credit agreement 
it is also reasonably possibl e that none of the above outcomes would occur and the wpc group may shut down a number of their operations 
according to the company s preliminary evaluation o f potential pension obligations  if a partial shutdown of the wpc group s operations were to occur in the immediate future  whx s liability for earl y retirement pension benefits could range from approximately million to million 
it is also possible that the wpc group could cease operations in thei r entirety and this liability would then be significantly greater 
however management does not believe this occurrence is likely 
under current pension la w and regulations based on the company s analysis of the current funded status o f the pension plan  if a partial shutdown were to occur at the present time  th e cash funding obligations would likely not begin until and would extend ove r several years 
such cash funding obligations would have a material advers e impact on the liquidity  financial position and capital resources of th e company 
the company s funding obligation and the impact on the company s liquidity  financial position and capital resources could be substantiall y reduced or eliminated if a partial shutdown  if it occurs  were to occur a t such a time that the fair market value of the assets of the plan approximates o r exceeds the plan s liabilities including the early retirement benefits  a shutdown were to occur gradually over several years or the number of the wp c group s operations shut down were less than those assumed in estimating th e above mentioned amounts

at december   the whx group held million in equit y securities classified as trading in accordance with sfas each quarter th e company adjusts the carrying amount of its trading securities to fair marke t value  with any resulting adjustment being charged or credited to other income at year end  a hypothetical decrease in the value of the equity tradin g securities would have resulted in a million unfavorable impact on preta x income

at december   the company s investment portfolio include d us government fixed income securities totaling million 
the fair value o f these instruments will increase or decrease as a result of changes in marke t interest rates

the company attempts to maintain a reasonable balance between fixe d and floating rate debt in an attempt to keep financing costs as low as possible at december   a majority of the company s portfolio of long term deb t consisted of fixed rate instruments 
accordingly  the fair value of suc h instruments may be relatively sensitive to effects of interest rat e fluctuations 
in addition  the fair value of such instruments is also affecte d by investors assessments of the risks associated with industries in which th e company operates as well as the company s overall creditworthiness and abilit y to satisfy such obligations upon their maturity
