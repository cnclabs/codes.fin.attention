the following should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements for the year ended december   contained under item herein 
overview since its inception in april  cell genesys  inc has focused its research and product development efforts on human disease therapies which are based on innovative gene modification technologies 
the company s strategic objective is to develop and commercialize cancer vaccines and gene therapies to treat cancer and other major  life threatening diseases 
cell genesys current clinical programs include gvax cancer vaccines in phase ii studies for prostate cancer  phase i ii studies for lung cancer and a phase i ii study for multiple myeloma 
the company expects to initiate additional gvax cancer vaccine trials for prostate cancer and lung cancer as well as pancreatic cancer and leukemia during the next year 
gvax vaccines for prostate cancer and lung cancer are being developed through a worldwide collaboration with the pharmaceutical division of japan tobacco inc jt 
in addition  cell genesys has preclinical programs which are evaluating potential gene therapies for cancer  hemophilia and cardiovascular disorders 
in january  cell genesys launched a new majority owned subsidiary  ceregene  inc  which will be focused on gene therapies for central nervous system disorders 
the company also has assets outside of its core business which can be used to help maintain financial strength while product candidates are under development 
these assets include cell genesys equity ownership of abgenix  inc  which is focused on the development and commercialization of antibody therapies and a licensing program in gene activation technology for therapeutic proteins 
during  cell genesys continued to build its gene therapy business through progress in both clinical and preclinical programs  by further validating its technology through multiple scientific papers and patent issuances  and by establishing licensing agreements for its gene therapy technologies 
during  cell genesys financial position significantly increased as a result of the appreciation in value of the company s holdings in abgenix 
additionally  cell genesys participated in two abgenix stock sales in  raising approximately million to strengthen the company s cash position 
cell genesys financial resources will enable the company to aggressively pursue products within its portfolio and to potentially acquire product candidates or technologies to create further shareholder value 
cell genesys believes that gene therapies are likely to be developed on a continuum  progressing from ex vivo modification of cells outside the patient s body for injection as therapy to in vivo modification of cells within the patient s body to provide therapy 
the company s goal is to emphasize off the shelf products that enable gene therapy to be provided in out patient settings 
these potentially include both non patient specific therapies  which could be vialed pharmaceuticals for direct administration  and patient specific gene therapy products  which could be manufactured as non patient specific products at cell genesys and combined with patients cells during treatment 
ex vivo gene therapies currently are being evaluated by cell genesys in human clinical studies 
these include studies of gvax therapeutic vaccines that are designed to impart new disease fighting capabilities to the patient s immune system  in order to enhance an immune response against malignant cells 
encouraging data were obtained from clinical trials of gvax prostate cancer vaccine  gvax lung cancer vaccine and gvax pancreatic cancer vaccine in based on these encouraging results and encouraging results from a preclinical study for gvax vaccine in leukemia  cell genesys has launched a phase i trial in multiple myeloma and expects to launch clinical trials for prostate cancer  lung cancer  leukemia and pancreatic cancer during the coming year 
in vivo gene therapies are at the preclinical stage of development at cell genesys 
treatment strategies may target cells that typically cannot be removed from the body for external processing and therefore are modified within the body 
with in vivo gene therapy  the treatment goals include stimulating targeted cells to produce a protein or other substance needed to normalize key biological processes  or otherwise inhibiting specific disease processes 
in  the company continued preclinical studies in a number of therapeutic areas and further developed its gene therapy technologies 
the company s preclinical research focuses on studies of gene therapy in animal models for cancer  hemophilia and cardiovascular disorders 
the company s preclinical gene therapy program in parkinson s disease will be pursued in the future by cell genesys majority owned subsidiary  ceregene  inc  which was launched in january cell genesys ended the year of with approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company has maintained its financial position by relying on funding from various corporate collaborations and licensing agreements  as well as through strategic management of its resources 
revenues for were derived primarily from the above mentioned gvax collaboration and payments received in connection with the company s gene activation technology licensing program 
in the first quarter of  cell genesys received net proceeds of approximately million for the sale of  pre stock splits shares of abgenix common stock 
the transaction was related to a secondary abgenix offering in which a total of  abgenix shares were sold with  of the shares being sold by cell genesys 
after the transaction  cell genesys held  shares pre stock splits  or approximately percent of abgenix common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  cell genesys participated in a separate secondary abgenix offering which was a private placement of  post stock splits shares of which  were sold by cell genesys 
net proceeds of approximately million were received from this transaction  and the company held  shares post stock splits of abgenix stock or approximately percent after the sale 
results of operations as a result of abgenix s ipo on july   the company s ownership percentage was reduced to less than percent and abgenix has been accounted for under the equity method of accounting from that date to november in november  abgenix completed a public offering of million shares and a private placement of million shares of its common stock  further reducing cell genesys ownership to approximately percent 
consequently  from november forward  the company is accounting for its investment in abgenix as equity securities which are considered available for sale in accordance with sfas accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
abgenix was fully consolidated in the company s financial statements prior to july  revenue decreased to million in  from million and million in and  respectively 
revenues for were derived primarily from the company s gvax collaboration and payments received in connection with the company s gene activation technology licensing program 
revenues for were impacted by the adoption of sab and the resulting change in the company s revenue recognition policy 
as a result of the adoption of sab a cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million  net of taxes was recorded in see the revenue recognition note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our adoption of sab 
revenues for included a one time payment of million received in connection with a former collaboration agreement that was terminated in september during  the company recognized and received million in milestone payments for the gvax prostate and lung programs 
in february  cell genesys entered into an agreement to license the company s gene activation technology to aventis formerly hoechst marion roussel for erythropoietin epo and a second undisclosed protein 
the agreement provides for milestone payments and annual maintenance fees  in addition to royalties on future sales of one potential gene activated protein products 
the company recognized revenue of million  million and million in  and  respectively  pursuant to the aventis agreement 
research and development expenses increased to million during  from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase can be attributed in part to the company s expanding clinical trials for gvax cancer vaccine and hemophilia programs 
the decrease in was primarily the result of a corporate restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of the decrease also reflects the discontinuance of the aids gene therapy program 
the company expects that its research and development expenditures will increase in future years to support expanded and more numerous clinical trials and additional product development activities 
the rate of increase depends on a number of factors including progress in research and development and clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase resulted from additional headcount and facility infrastructure to support expanding preclinical and clinical programs 
in december  the company terminated an agreement with genzyme under which the company would be acquired  resulting in a one time non recurring cost of million that was paid in december  during  the company had sold shares of abgenix that resulted in realized gain of million 
in  the sale of abgenix stock resulted in million realized gain 
interest and other income was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the higher income in is resulting from the sale of abgenix stock in february and november interest expense decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease reflects expired capital leases and repayment of a million tenant improvement loan in march interest expense in included interest on a note payable to genpharm international commencing january  which was paid in full in september cell genesys net income in its gene therapy operations was million in  compared to net losses of million in and million in the increase in income for was primarily due to million gain realized on sales of abgenix common stock  net of tax  partially offset by a million  net of tax  revenue adjustment under the cumulative effect of accounting change following the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab during the first quarter of the loss in was primarily due to a one time merger termination charge of million in december losses  excluding non recurring charges and gains from sales of abgenix stock  are expected to continue and may increase in future years as operating expenses rise  particularly as the company incurs expenses related to manufacturing and late stage human testing of its potential products 
at december   cell genesys had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in the years of through  if not utilized 
the large capital gains associated with the sale of a portion of the company s investment in abgenix during february and november are have consumed a large portion of these net operating loss carryovers and tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cell genesys has financed its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  funding under collaborative arrangements  sale of abgenix common stock and equipment financing 
in february and november  the company received million in net proceeds for the sale of shares of abgenix common stock 
from inception through february   the company received million in net proceeds from equity financings and million under collaborative agreements 
at december   cell genesys cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  the increase was due primarily to net proceeds from the sale of abgenix common stock 
at december   the company held approximately million shares of abgenix common stock 
during  the company made estimated federal income tax payments of million and in march made an estimated state income tax payment of million 
these payments represent tax payable on our taxable income  including the net gains of million on abgenix stock sales  net of available net operating loss nol carryfowards and other applicable tax credits 
the company has additional unutilized nol carryforwards  although the future utilization of these nol carryforwards is limited by irs regulation section  which imposes an annual limitation on taxable income which can be offset by nols following a change in control 
the company  for irs purposes  experienced a change in control during its acquisition of somatix in it is the company s current intention to minimize future tax liabilities on sales of abgenix stock by offsetting gains against current operating losses and the nol carryfowards allowed under section in addition  the company has certain research and development tax credits which it may utilize to offset such gains 
however  under some circumstances the company may sell more abgenix stock and consequently recognize more gain than it may be able to shelter from tax using these methods 
cell genesys anticipates that fiscal year cash usage will not exceed million  net of tax payments  sales of abgenix stock  or build out costs of manufacturing facilities and any potential acquisition of a late stage product candidate 
the company s capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development programs  preclinical and clinical trials  clinical and commercial scale manufacturing requirements  the attraction of collaborative partners  the acquisition of new products or technologies  the cost of litigation  and patent interference proceedings or other legal proceedings or their resolution 
nonetheless  progress in the company s development programs and or the increase in the number of programs will reduce the current cash resources and potentially create the need to raise further capital 
therefore  the company may continue to consider financing alternatives  including the potential sale of additional shares of abgenix stock 
while the company believes that its current liquidity position will be sufficient to meet near future needs it anticipates that it will entertain the possibility of raising additional capital in advance of actual capital expenditures to preserve its liquidity 
therefore liquidity and volatility of capital markets play a significant role in the decision to raise capital 
the types of financing available to the company includes the sale of abgenix securities and private or public placement of cell genesys equity securities 
the company s evaluation processes regularly consider the liquidity of capital markets  dilution  shareholder value and tax consequences of each type of financing on shareholders 
certain of the financing options available to the company have some type of negative consequence to shareholders 
given the volatile nature of the capital markets  decisions to raise capital may require actions that would impose a slightly negative consequence in order to reduce or minimize a more significant negative consequence to shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 fin  was issued 
fin clarifies the application of apb no 
for certain stock based compensation issues 
fin clarifies the definition of employee for purposes of applying apb no 
 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed option or award  and the accounting for an exchange of share compensation awards in a business combination  among others 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions in this interpretation cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position 
risk factors we may have a need for substantial additional funds 
we may need substantial funds for existing and planned preclinical and clinical trials  to continue research and development activities  and to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities for any products we may develop 
at some point in the future  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase as a result of  many factors such as continued scientific progress of research and development programs magnitude of such programs progress of preclinical and clinical testing time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent claims competing technological and market developments changes in collaborative relationships with japan tobacco and others terms of any additional collaborative arrangements into which we may enter our ability to establish research  development and commercialization arrangements pertaining to products other than those covered by existing collaborative arrangements cost of establishing manufacturing facilities cost of commercialization activities demand for our products  if and when approved potential redemption obligations in connection with conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock 
our ability to realize the carrying value of the abgenix stock due to its volatility 
we expect to raise additional funds through collaborative relationships  sales of some portion or all of our investment in abgenix  additional equity or debt financings  or otherwise 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
there can be no assurance that any such additional funding will be available to us  or  if available  that it will be on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  stockholders will incur immediate dilution 
there can be no assurance that opportunities for in licensing technologies or for third party collaborations will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research  development and clinical activities 
alternatively  we may need to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
our products are in developmental stage  are not approved for commercial sale and might not receive regulatory approval or become commercially viable 
all of our potential cancer vaccine and gene therapy products are in research and development 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales for at least the next several years 
our products currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval  prior to commercial use 
there can be no assurance that our research and development efforts will be successful or that any of our future products will ultimately be commercially successful 
even if developed  our products may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully introduced and marketed at prices that would permit us to operate profitably 
we have not been profitable in our operations absent the gains on sales of abgenix stock and may not become profitable in the future 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit since our inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  down from million from december  for the year ended december   we recorded a net income of million primarily from the gain on sale of abgenix common stock 
absent this sale  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years due primarily to the expansion of research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing and to a lesser extent  from general and administrative expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market any products 
we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve or sustain product revenues or profitability 
our cancer vaccine and gene therapy programs depend on new and unproven technologies 
gene therapy is a new technology 
existing preclinical and clinical data on the safety and efficacy of gene therapy are limited 
data relating to our specific gene therapy approaches are also limited 
our gvax cancer vaccines are currently being tested in phase i ii and phase ii human clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy 
none of our other products or therapies under development are in human clinical trials 
the results of preclinical studies do not predict safety or efficacy in humans 
possible side effects of gene therapy may be serious and potentially life threatening 
unacceptable side effects may be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of our potential products or thereafter 
there are many reasons that potential products that appear promising at an early stage of research or development do not result in commercialization 
although we are testing proposed products or therapies in human clinical trials  we cannot guarantee that we will be permitted to undertake human clinical trials for any of our other products 
also  the results of this testing might not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of these products 
even if clinical trials are successful  we might not obtain regulatory approval for any indication 
finally  even if our products proceed successfully through clinical trials and receive regulatory approval  there is no guarantee that an approved product can be produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or that such a product will be successfully marketed 
we rely heavily on the development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including cell genesys  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
cell genesys currently have approximately issued or granted patents and more than pending applications 
although we are prosecuting patent applications  we cannot be certain whether any given application will result in the issuance of a patent or  if any patent is issued  whether it will provide significant proprietary protection or will be invalidated 
also  patent applications in the united states are confidential until patents are issued 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the patents or proprietary rights of others and not breaching licenses granted to us 
we will be required to obtain licenses to certain third party technology and genes necessary to conduct our business 
any failure to license any technology or genes required to commercialize our technologies or products at reasonable cost may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may also have to engage in litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  to enforce our patents  or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
to determine the priority of inventions  the united states patent and trademark office frequently declares interference proceedings 
in europe  other patents can be revoked through opposition proceedings 
such proceedings could result in an adverse decision as to the priority of our inventions 
we are currently involved in separate interference and or opposition proceedings with regard to i gene activation technology ii ex vivo gene therapy iii certain retroviral vector technology iv chimeric receptor technology while we believe our position in each proceeding is strong  the outcome of each proceeding cannot be predicted 
an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our intellectual property position in these areas 
we may be involved in other interference and or opposition proceedings in the future 
we believe that there will continue to be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our competitors may independently develop similar or better proprietary information and techniques and disclose them publicly 
also  there can be no assurance that others will not gain access to our trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets 
we require our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed by or made known to an individual during the course of the employment or consulting relationship generally must be kept confidential 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the employee while employed by us  relating to our business are our exclusive property 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
the fields of cancer vaccines and gene therapy are highly competitive 
competition in the field of gene therapy from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and from research and academic institutions is intense and expected to increase 
in many instances  we compete with other commercial entities in acquiring products or technology from universities 
there are numerous competitors working on products to treat each of the diseases for which we are seeking to develop therapeutic products 
some competitors are pursuing a product development strategy competitive with ours  particularly with respect to our cancer vaccine program 
certain of these competitive products are in more advanced stages of product development and clinical trials 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than ours  or that would render our technology and products less competitive or obsolete 
many of our competitiors have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
some of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products  in obtaining united states food and drug administration fda and other regulatory approvals of products  and in manufacturing and marketing such products 
accordingly  our competitors may obtain patent protection or fda approval and commercialize products more rapidly than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain certain biological materials necessary to support our research  development or manufacturing of any of our planned therapies 
if we are permitted to commence commercial sales of products  we will also be competing with respect to marketing capabilities and manufacturing efficiency  areas in which we have limited or no experience 
we expect to build additional clinical scale and commercial scale manufacturing facilities and or use contract facilities to commercialize our products 
we also expect to secure funding for these and other product development activities through our partners and future potential partners 
we expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  on product efficacy price safety reliability availability patent protection sales  marketing and distribution capabilities our competitive positions also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient funding for the often lengthy period between product conception and commercial sales 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the stock prices of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including cell genesys have historically been highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors may affect our stock price fluctuations in our financial results announcements of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or our competitors announcements of changes in governmental regulation affecting us or our competitors announcements of regulatory approvals or disapprovals of our or our competitors products developments in patent or other proprietary rights affecting us or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies general market conditions fluctuations in the price of abgenix stock severe fluctuations in price and volume in stock market in general which are unrelated to our operating perfromance inssuance of common stock upon conversion of the series b preferred stock future sales of such common stock or other shares of common stock by existing stockholders the perception that such issuances or sales could occur our business is subject to extensive regulation and any failure to our business is subject to extensive regulation and any failure to obtain required regulatory approvals could prevent or delay the commercialization of our products 
regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and foreign countries is important in the manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and our research and development activities 
all of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products must undergo rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other premarket approval procedures by the fda and similar authorities in foreign countries 
since our potential products involve the application of new technologies  regulatory approvals may take longer than for products produced using more conventional methods 
various federal and  in some cases  state laws also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of these products 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal laws  requires significant expenditures 
any delay or failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain regulatory approvals could hinder the marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
in responding to a new drug application  or a product license application  the fda may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or if granted may not cover all the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval 
also  an approval might contain significant limitations in the form of warnings  precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use 
in addition to laws and regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under occupational safety and health act environmental protection act toxic substances control act resource conservation and recovery act other present and potential future federal  state or local laws and regulations our manufacturing facilities are subject to licensing requirements of the california department of health services 
while not subject to license by the fda  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda as well as by the california department of health services 
a separate license from the fda is required for commercial manufacture of any product 
failure to maintain these licenses or to meet the inspection criteria of the fda and the california department of health services would disrupt our manufacturing processes and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
for marketing outside the united states  we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs and devices 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements or obtain required approvals could impair our ability to develop these markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our product development activities involve the use of hazardous materials and we may incur significant costs as a result of the need to comply with environmental laws 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  viruses and radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by applicable laws and regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any resulting liability could exceed our resources 
we may also be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
we expect to depend on our strategic partner for the sales  marketing and distribution of our future products 
we have no experience in sales  marketing or distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
we expect to rely on sales and marketing expertise of potential corporate partners for our initial products 
the decision to market future products directly or through corporate partners will be based on a number of factors  including market size and concentration size and expertise of the partner s sales force in a particular market our overall strategic objectives we may in the future be exposed to product liability claims and may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our potential products may expose us to liability claims resulting from the use of our products 
these claims might be made by consumers  health care providers or by others selling our products 
we currently maintain product liability insurance with respect to each of our clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance or that sufficient coverage can be acquired at a reasonable cost 
an inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost  or at all  could prevent or inhibit the clinical testing or commercialization of our products or otherwise affect our financial condition 
a product liability claim or recall could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
sales of our future products will be influenced by the willingness of third party payers to provide reimbursement 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our potential products will depend in part upon coverage and reimbursement from third party payers  including government agencies private health care insurers and other health care payers such as health maintenance organizations self insured employee plans blue cross blue shield and similar plans there is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
in particular  reimbursement from government agencies  insurers and large health organizations may become more restricted in the future 
our potential products represent a new mode of therapy and  while the cost benefit ratio of the products may be favorable  we expect that the costs associated with our products will be substantial 
there can be no assurance that our proposed products  if successfully developed  will be considered cost effective by third party payers 
insurance coverage might not be provided by third party payers at all or without substantial delay 
even if such coverage is provided  the approved reimbursement might not provide sufficient funds to enable us to become profitable 
the pricing of our future products may be influenced in part by government controls 
the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare may impair future revenues and profitability of biotechnology companies 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government control 
while we cannot predict whether the government will adopt any such legislative or regulatory proposals  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we depend on our key technical and management personnel and collaborative partners to advance our technology  and the loss of these personnel or partners could impair the development of our products 
we rely and will continue to rely on our key management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to recruit necessary additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
there is intense competition from other companies  research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we will need to continue to recruit experts in the areas of clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel 
if we do not succeed in recruiting such personnel or developing such expertise  our business could suffer significantly 
we have clinical trial agreements with a number of public and private medical institutions relating to the conduct of human clinical trials for our gvax cancer vaccine programs 
the early termination of any of these clinical trial agreements would hinder the progress of our clinical trials including trials of our gvax cancer vaccines 
if any of these relationships are terminated  the clinical trials might not be completed and the results might not be evaluated 
university of california  san francisco dana farber partners cancer care the johns hopkins medical institutions us oncology  inc university of tokyo  imsut providence portland medical center americasdoctor 
com  inc emory university university of michigan university of pennsylvania stanford university we rely on the continued availability of outside scientific collaborators performing research 
these relationships generally may be terminated at any time by the collaborator  typically by giving days notice 
these scientific collaborators are not our employees 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and can expect that only limited amounts of their time will be dedicated to our activities 
our agreements with these collaborators  as well as those with our scientific consultants  provide that any rights we obtain as a result of their research efforts will be subject to the rights of the research institutions in such work 
in addition  some of these collaborators have consulting or other advisory arrangements with other entities that may potentially conflict with their obligations to us 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that inventions or processes discovered by our scientific collaborators or consultants will become our property 
cell genesys stockholders may be diluted by the exercise of outstanding stock options  the conversion of outstanding series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  or other issuances of our common stock 
substantially all the outstanding shares of cell genesys common stock are eligible for sale in the public market 
conversion of the series b preferred stock or exercise of outstanding stock options would result in issuance of additional shares of common stock  diluting existing investors 
the number of shares of common stock issued  and therefore the dilution of existing investors  would increase as a result of either i an event triggering the antidilution rights of any outstanding shares of series b preferred stock  or ii a decline in the market price of the company s common stock immediately prior to conversion of the series b preferred stock 
the holders of the series b preferred stock may choose at any time to convert their shares into common stock 
in that event  the number of shares of common stock issued would be based on the lower of a fixed conversion price of per share for the remaining shares from the original issue of million face value preferred stock  and per share for the shares issued january from call options see below or  the average of certain trading prices during the trading days preceding such date of conversion the floating conversion price 
during  the market price of the common stock traded above the fixed conversion price of and per share and consequently the conversion rate of the series b preferred stock is currently based on the fixed conversion price 
should the market price decline below the fixed conversion rate  the greater the decline in the market price  the greater the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred stock 
on january   the company received approximately million from the issuance of new series b convertible preferred shares following the exercise of call options for these shares 
the newly issued preferred shares have a fixed conversion price of and other terms as defined by the series b preferred stock agreements dated november  the call option right which was available under the terms of these agreements was triggered by the appreciation of cell genesys stock price 
following the issuance of the new preferred shares  no further call options remain outstanding
