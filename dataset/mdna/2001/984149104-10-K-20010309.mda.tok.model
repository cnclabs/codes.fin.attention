at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately  the achievement of profitability is primarily dependent upon the continued development and commercial acceptance of the company s products  the successful management of the business and management s ability to strategically focus the company 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when profitable operations will occur 
in addition  the company is experiencing negative cash flow from operations and it is expected that it will continue to experience negative cash flows through and potentially thereafter 
the company anticipates that its working capital requirements and operating expenses will increase as the company expands production of its mobile assistant series  develops new models in the mobile assistant series  further expands its sales  service and marketing functions  and develops the support structure for these activities 
the timing of increases in personnel and other expenses  the amount of working capital consumed by operations  marketing and rollout expenses for the mobile assistant series and other products  and competitive pressures on gross margins will impact the magnitude and timing of the company s cash requirements 
management is currently exploring financing alternatives to supplement the company s cash position 
potential sources of additional financing include private equity offerings  strategic investments  strategic partnerships and various forms of debt financing

this facility allows for the funding of large orders through borrowings made at the time the company receives a customer s purchase order through the collection of the customer s receivable

the company s management believes that the combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and outside funding will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements 
although the equity markets have declined in recent months  management believes the company will be successful in its efforts to obtain such additional financing  based both on its historical ability to raise capital and on debt and equity financings currently available to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can or will obtain sufficient funds from operations or from closing additional financings on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient additional financing  it will be required to reduce discretionary spending in order to maintain its operations at a reduced level 
management believes that it will be able to reduce discretionary spending if required but that such reduction would negatively impact progress on implementing the company s business plan
