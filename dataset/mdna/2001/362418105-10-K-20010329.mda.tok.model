item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a reit focused within the multifamily industry in demand driven markets throughout the united states that have high job growth and are resilient to economic downturns 
our operating performance relies predominantly on net operating income from our apartment communities 
net operating income is determined by rental revenues and operating expenses  which are affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets 
our performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and our ability to develop and acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of our blended cost of capital 
business objectives and strategy our objective is to increase shareholder value by producing consistent high quality earnings to sustain dividend growth and annual total returns that exceed the multifamily sector average 
to achieve that objective  we employ a number of business strategies 
first  our long term investment strategy is research driven with the objective of creating a portfolio of high quality assets in approximately six to eight strategically selected markets that are complementary through economic diversity and characterized by high job growth and resiliency to national economic downturns 
we believe such a portfolio will provide predictable growth in operating cash flow on a sustainable basis 
second  we adhere to a strategy of owning and operating high quality  class aa a apartment communities under the gables brand 
we believe that such communities  when located in highly desirable areas to live and supplemented with high quality service and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice who is willing to pay a premium for location preference  superior service and high quality communities 
the resulting portfolio should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates 
this  coupled with more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements associated with high quality construction materials  should lead to operating margins that exceed national averages for the multifamily sector and sustainable growth in operating cash flow 
third  our aim is to be recognized as the employer of choice within the industry 
our mission of taking care of the way people live is a cornerstone of our strategy  involving innovative human resource practices that we believe will attract and retain the highest caliber associates 
because of our long established presence as a fully integrated apartment management  development  construction  acquisition and disposition company within our markets  we have the ability to offer multi faceted career opportunities among the various disciplines within the industry 
finally  our capital strategy is to maximize return on invested capital while maintaining financial flexibility through a conservative  investment grade credit profile 
we judiciously manage our capital and are able to recycle existing capital through asset dispositions 
we believe the successful execution of these strategies will result in operating cash flow and dividend growth  producing annual total returns that exceed the multifamily reit sector average 
we believe we are well positioned to continue achieving our objectives because of our long established presence as a fully integrated real estate company in our markets 
this local market presence creates a competitive advantage in generating increased cash flow from property operations during different economic cycles and new investment opportunities that involve site selection  market information and requests for entitlements and zoning petitions 
portfolio wide occupancy levels have remained high and portfolio wide rental rates have continued to increase during each of the last several years 
we expect portfolio wide rental expenses to increase at a rate slightly ahead of inflation and believe that it will approximate the increase in property revenues for the coming twelve months 
our ongoing evaluation of the growth prospects for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
in that event  we would intend to sell the asset and utilize the net proceeds from any such sale to invest in new assets expected to have better growth prospects  reduce indebtedness or  in certain circumstances with appropriate approval from our board of trustees  repurchase outstanding common shares 
we maintain staffing levels sufficient to meet existing construction  acquisition  and leasing activities 
if market conditions warrant  we would anticipate adjusting staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the code 
for the tax year ending december   a reit must distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income 
as a result of recently enacted tax legislation  effective for tax years beginning after december   the distribution requirement has been reduced from to of a reit s ordinary taxable income 
provided we maintain our qualification as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on distributed net income 
the recently enacted tax legislation also alters the requirements for qualification as a reit 
in particular  the new legislation generally liberalizes  from the perspective of our historic operations  the asset diversification requirements applicable to reits 
effective for tax years beginning after december   a reit may own the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary without limitation on the reit s voting control over the subsidiary  provided that not more than of the value of the reit s total assets is represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries

the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations to our communities  in addition to monthly principal amortization payments  are also expected to be funded from net cash provided by operations 
we anticipate that construction and development activities as well as land purchases will be initially funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facilities described below

million credit facility we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility provided by a consortium of banks 
the facility currently has a maturity date of may with a one year extension option 
borrowings under the facility currently bear interest at our option of libor plus or prime minus 
such scheduled interest rates may be adjusted up or down based on changes in our senior unsecured credit ratings 
we may also enter into competitive bid loans with participating banks for up to million at rates below the scheduled rates 
in addition  we pay an annual facility fee equal to of the million commitment 
availability under the facility is based on the value of our unencumbered real estate assets as compared to the amount of our unsecured indebtedness

at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility 
million credit facility we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank that currently bears interest at libor plus 
the facility currently has a maturity date of october with unlimited one year extension options 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  restrictive covenants certain of our debt agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default  including covenants which restrict the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts our discretion to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year the operating partnership may only distribute up to of its consolidated income available for distribution as defined in the related agreement exclusive of distributions of capital gains for such year 
the applicable debt agreements contain exceptions to these limitations to allow the operating partnership to make any distributions necessary to allow us to maintain our status as a reit 
we do not anticipate that this provision will adversely effect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions or our ability to declare dividends  as currently anticipated 
inflation substantially all leases at our communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable us to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to lessen the impact of cost increases arising from inflation

table of contents management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund distributions and capital expenditures 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
effective january   nareit amended its definition of ffo to include in ffo all non recurring items  except those defined as extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property 
we are using the amended definition of ffo in reporting our results for all periods on or after january  in addition  we have restated ffo reported for prior periods 
ffo as defined by nareit represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus certain non cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  our ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the amended nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less recurring  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures 
ffo and affo should not be considered alternatives to net income as indicators of our operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of our cash needs  including principal amortization  capital expenditures  and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our cash needs and cash flows

table of contents management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share data item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our capital structure includes the use of variable rate and fixed rate indebtedness 
as such  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates 
we periodically seek input from third party consultants regarding market interest rate and credit risk in order to evaluate our interest rate exposure 
in certain situations  we may utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of rate caps  rate swaps or rate locks  to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of related balance sheet instruments and prospective financing transactions 
we do not utilize such instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we typically refinance maturing debt instruments at then existing market interest rates and terms which may be more or less than the interest rates and terms on the maturing debt 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates in effect at december  by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average interest rates presented in this table are inclusive of credit enhancement fees
