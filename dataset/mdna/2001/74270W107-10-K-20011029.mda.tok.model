item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we develop  manufacture and market nas appliances and other storage devices for a wide range of computer networks and operating systems 
our nas appliances  which consist of our dataforce and netforce product lines  provide end users with faster access to data at a lower overall cost than other storage alternatives 
we refer to these products collectively as our nas appliances 
in addition  we sell disk drive storage upgrade systems  cd dvd rom servers and arrays and tape backup products  which we refer to collectively as our non nas products 
over the last four years  we have significantly increased our focus on the development and sale of nas appliances 
we continue to develop more advanced nas appliances and expect this business to be our principal business in the future 
we are currently analyzing the market demands and opportunities for all of our non nas products  and we hope to transition users of these products to our growing line of more complex  generally higher margin nas solutions 
changing business mix 
in recent periods  we have experienced significantly reduced demand  revenues and gross margins for our non nas products and we have discontinued some non nas products 
the demand for our cd servers and arrays has declined and we have experienced increased pricing pressures on our disk drive storage upgrade systems  resulting in lower overall revenues and gross margins 
our gross margins vary significantly by product line  and  therefore  our overall gross margin varies with the mix of products we sell 
for example  our sales of cd servers and arrays have historically generated higher gross margins than those of our tape back up and disk drive products 
in future periods  as sales of our higher margin nas appliances continue to increase as a percentage of total sales  we expect our overall gross margins to be positively affected 
our revenues and gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of factors including new product introductions and enhancements  competition  direct versus indirect sales  the mix and average selling prices of products  and the cost of labor and components 
revenue and revenue recognition 
we generally record sales upon product shipment 
in the case of sales to most of our distributors  we record sales when the distributor receives the products 
we recognize our product service and support revenues over the terms of their respective contractual periods 
our agreements with many of our vars  system integrators and distributors allow limited product returns  including stock balancing  and price protection privileges 
we maintain reserves  which are adjusted at each financial reporting date  to state fairly the anticipated returns  including stock balancing  and price protection claims relating to each reporting period 
we calculate the reserves based on historical rates of sales and returns  including price protection and stock balancing claims  our experience with our customers  our contracts with them  and current information as to the level of our inventory held by our customers 
in addition  under a product evaluation program established by us  our indirect channel partners and end users generally are able to purchase appliances on a trial basis and return the appliances within a specified period  generally days  if they are not satisfied 
the period may be extended if the customer needs additional time to evaluate the product within the customer s particular operating environment 
the value of evaluation units at customer sites at a financial reporting date are included in inventory as finished goods 
at july  and  inventory related to evaluation units was approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not record evaluation units as sales until the customer has notified us of acceptance of these units 
costs and expenses 
our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of components produced by our suppliers  such as disk drives  cabinets  power supplies  controllers and cpus  our direct and indirect labor expenses and related overhead costs such as rent  utilities and manufacturing supplies and other expenses 
in addition  cost of sales includes third party license fees  warranty expenses and reserves for obsolete inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses include costs directly associated with the selling process such as salaries and commissions of sales personnel  marketing  direct and cooperative advertising and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses include our general corporate expenses  such as salaries and benefits  rent  utilities  bad debt expense  legal and other professional fees and expenses  depreciation and amortization of goodwill 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist of the costs associated with software and hardware development 
specifically  these costs include employee salaries and benefits  consulting fees for contract programmers  test supplies  employee training and other related expenses 
the cost of developing new appliances and substantial enhancements to existing appliances are expensed as incurred 
the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales for each of the periods indicated year ended july  statement of operations net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development acquired in process research and development impairment and restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss interest income expense  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales decreased by to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease resulted from a significant decrease in unit sales of our legacy products  which include cd servers and arrays and disk drive storage upgrade systems  and the effect of the strategic discontinuance of specific product lines 
we expect to see continued weakness in the demand for our disk drive storage upgrade systems  cd servers and arrays and non nas product sales throughout fiscal  and we may accelerate the discontinuance of our non nas products 
net sales related to our nas appliances increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increased unit sales of our netforce nas appliances offset by decreased sales of our dataforce nas appliances 
international sales were million  or of our net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of our net sales  in fiscal the decrease in international sales is due primarily to reduced sales of non nas products by our german subsidiary 
as a percentage of overall sales  international sales improved over fiscal due primarily to sales of our nas products to customers in europe and asia  including sales of approximately million to a european storage service provider  other sales of nas appliances by our german and swiss subsidiaries  and reduced us sales of our cd servers and arrays 
there can be no assurance that our revenues of our nas products will continue to increase in any particular quarter or period  or that any specific customers will continue to purchase our products in such period 
gross profit decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin increased to for the year ended july   from for the comparable period in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of the higher percentage of nas revenues  offset to a lesser extent by a reduction in sales of cd servers and arrays  which have historically experienced higher margins  and an increase in our inventory reserves associated with the discontinuation of specific product lines in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we realized reduced margins on lower sales of disk drive upgrade systems due to price erosion in the disk drive upgrade industry 
we expect that gross margins may be impacted by continuing reductions in sales of some of our higher margin non nas product lines  such as cd servers and arrays 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of reduced sales and administrative salaries and commissions  reduced cooperative advertising costs and reduced expenses of our german subsidiary offset by increased selling and administrative costs of our italian subsidiary and a million increase in our accounts receivables reserves due primarily to the weak economic conditions and their impact on the financial stability of several of our customers 
in addition  we incurred reduced advertising  marketing and travel costs  offset somewhat by increased legal fees and increases in the cost of personnel necessary to support our nas sales and marketing efforts 
during fiscal  we continued to identify and eliminate certain positions and functions not related to our core nas activities 
as a result  we experienced some reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses in the past year 
we expect overall selling  general and administrative expenses in the next fiscal year to continue to decrease as we continue our cost saving initiatives undertaken in fiscal research and development expenses decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the dollar decrease was due primarily to reduced costs for evaluation units and test supplies offset slightly by increases in compensation expense for additional nas software programmers and hardware developers 
as we continue to support the growth of our nas business  we do anticipate a decrease in our research and development expenses in the next fiscal year as we undertake cost saving initiatives in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in december  we acquired the outstanding shares of scofima  an italian company engaged in software development 
we employed an appraiser to value the assets of scofima 
the appraiser assigned a value of approximately million to in process research and development relating to software being developed by scofima which had not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no alternative future use was available 
as a result  we incurred a one time charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal see discussion of assumptions used by appraiser in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease is due primarily to a decline in our average investable cash position  which we had historically invested in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of less than days  during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by interest earned on net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense increased to million for the year ended july  compared to the comparable period in fiscal the increase is attributable to the issuance of a million convertible debenture  borrowings under our cit term loan agreement and amortization of prepaid loan costs  which included a write off of million in debt issuance costs associated with the million convertible debenture repayment 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal our new corporate headquarters was placed into service and we began to incur interest expense on the amount we have financed for our building 
previously  interest expense had been capitalized as part of the development cost of our headquarters 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the fiscal provision of million represents primarily an increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
at july   we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset 
as to our ability to successfully transition to and grow our nas product sales  the realization of the tax benefits relating to our net deferred tax asset will be dependent on our ability to return to profitability  which management believes will occur in fiscal fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales decreased by to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  this decrease resulted from a significant decrease in unit sales of cd servers and arrays and disk drive storage upgrade systems  combined with the effect of significant price erosion of the average selling price of these products 
we expect to see continued weakness in the demand for our disk drive storage upgrade systems and cd servers and arrays and non nas product sales throughout fiscal  and we may accelerate the discontinuance of our non nas products 
net sales related to our disk based nas appliances increased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily the result of increased unit sales of our netforce nas appliances including approximately million in sales to hewlett packard under our five year agreement with them and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of our dataforce nas appliances 
international sales fell to million  or of our net sales  for the year ended july   compared to million  or of our net sales  in the year ended july  while the decrease in absolute dollars was the result of reduced sales of commodity disk drive and tape backup systems internationally  the increase in international sales as a percentage of our net sales was due primarily to reduced us sales of our cd servers and arrays 
gross profit decreased to million  for the year ended july   from million  for the year ended july  gross margin decreased to of net sales for the year ended july   from of net sales for the year ended july  the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the higher percentage of total revenues of our european subsidiaries  which have historically experienced lower margins  and to a lesser extent  a reduction in sales of cd servers and arrays  which have historically experienced higher margins 
in addition  we realized reduced margins on lower sales of disk drive upgrade systems due to competition and price erosion in the disk drive upgrade industry 
we expect further reductions in gross margins due to decreases in sales of some of our higher margin non nas product lines  such as cd servers and arrays  until sales of our nas appliances significantly increase as a percentage of our total sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended july   from million in the year ended july   and increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of reduced sales commissions  occasioned by lower gross profit 
in addition  we incurred reduced advertising and marketing costs  and reduced legal fees  offset by increases in the cost of personnel necessary to support our nas sales and marketing efforts 
during the year ended july   we identified and eliminated certain positions and functions not related to our core nas activities 
as a result  we experienced a slight reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal however  we expect overall selling  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods as we plan to substantially increase spending on efforts to market our nas appliances and we expect increased facilities costs  such as utilities  taxes and maintenance  as we utilize our recently completed corporate headquarters 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended july   from million  or of net sales  for the year ended july  these increases were primarily due to compensation expense for additional nas software programmers and hardware developers 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  with the expected addition of dedicated nas engineering resources 
interest income expense 
net interest income decreased to million for the year ended july   from million for the year ended july  during fiscal year  we invested the majority of our available cash in investment grade commercial paper with maturities of less than days 
as a result of a decrease in our investable cash position  partially offset by slightly increased interest rates  net interest income decreased in fiscal interest expense for each of the applicable periods includes relatively minor amounts of interest paid on lines of credit maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect that interest income will be reduced in the future and that interest expense will increase significantly due to the financing of our corporate headquarters  and our need to borrow additional amounts to finance our operations 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate for the year ended july  was  compared to an effective tax benefit rate of for the same period in fiscal the fiscal benefit approximates the federal and state statutory rates applied to our us operating losses  reduced by unusable foreign operating losses  and adjusted for research and development credits 
the corresponding fiscal effective tax rate reflects the statutory rates and unusable foreign losses  partially offset by research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of july   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal relates primarily to our net loss  net of a million one time charge relating to acquired in process research and development  increases in our accounts receivable as we granted extended terms to our foreign customers offset by an increase in reserves of million relating to weak global economic conditions and their impact on the financial stability of several of our customers  and a decrease in accounts payable  as we paid off nearly all of the costs of our corporate headquarters which was completed in september these uses of cash were slightly offset by decreases in our inventories  which included an increase in reserves of million primarily associated with the discontinuation of specific product lines and the receipt of approximately million of our income tax refund receivable 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal resulted from a net loss before non cash charges of million offset in part by a decrease in working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was entirely the result of a decrease in working capital as our net loss adjusted for non cash charges was negligible 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  while net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was the result of expenditures of million to complete our corporate headquarters and purchases of million of other property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was a result of the redemption of million of short term marketable securities partially offset by purchases of million of property and equipment and million in costs to construct our corporate headquarters 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted from the purchases of million of property and equipment and million of investments in short term marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the sale of  shares of our common stock  the issuance of a million convertible debenture  and approximately million in stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  reduced by the repayment of approximately million in loans previously secured by our commercial paper portfolio and million in convertible debentures 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in a loan payable and million in stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of borrowings of million under a loan partially offset by net payments on our lines of credit and repurchases of common stock 
on july   we had established a revolving line of credit with finova capital corporation 
the line had been based on a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory  up to a maximum of  in early october  we paid off all amounts outstanding under the finova line of credit and replaced it with the line of credit with cit business credit see below 
on october   we entered into a term loan agreement and a three year working capital line of credit with cit business credit cit 
a term loan of million  due and payable upon the finalization of a long term mortgage on our corporate headquarters or paid in monthly installments commencing april   was repaid in may an initial term loan of million  due and payable in days  was repaid on november  the term loans under the agreement incurred interest at the lender s prime rate per annum at july   plus  with increases if the loan was not reduced according to a fixed amortization 
the working capital line of credit allows us to borrow  on a revolving basis  for a period of three years  a specified percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventories approximately million at july   up to a limit of million 
amounts outstanding under the working capital line bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under the various credit arrangements 
the lender charged approximately  for the credit facility  which is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement 
the line of credit accrues various monthly maintenance  minimum usage and early termination fees 
the line of credit requires certain financial and other covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum ebitda requirement for each fiscal quarter beginning in the quarter ended january  at july   we were not in compliance with the minimum ebitda requirement 
although we have repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facility and do not intend to borrow against the line of credit in fiscal  cit may elect to decline making any advances under the line of credit or may terminate the line 
in addition  if advances are made while we are out of compliance with the financial or other covenants  cit may charge us the default rate of interest currently per annum on those advances 
we have initiated discussions with various other potential financing sources regarding an alternate short term working capital financing arrangement 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining any such financing arrangement on favorable or any terms 
the line of credit is collateralized by all of our assets 
in addition to the cit line of credit noted above  we replaced the finova flooring line of credit with a flooring line with ibm credit  which has committed to make million in flooring inventory commitments available to us 
as of july   we owed  under the flooring line 
the flooring line is collateralized by the specific inventory purchased pursuant to the flooring commitments 
cit and ibm credit have entered into an intercreditor agreement which determines the level of priority of either lender s security interest 
the flooring line requires the maintenance of a minimum net worth of million  and we were in compliance with this covenant at july  the flooring line also requires us to represent  at the time we request advances under the line  that we are in compliance with the terms of our other loan agreements 
because of our default of the financial covenant of the cit credit line  we were out of compliance with this provision of the flooring line at july  although we have no borrowings outstanding under the cit credit line  we have advised ibm of the cit default and have requested ibm to advise us that ibm will not declare a default under the ibm flooring line in respect of the cit covenant default outstanding under the cit credit line 
if ibm were to declare a default under the flooring line  ibm could decline to make further advances under this line and or terminates 
as of july   we had  outstanding under the flooring line 
on october   we issued a million convertible unsecured debenture to a private investor 
the debenture bears interest at per annum and is repayable in full on october   unless otherwise converted into our common stock 
the debenture is convertible into our common stock at the investor s option at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to antidilution adjustments  and at our option  if our common stock trades at more than of the conversion then in effect for at least consecutive trading days 
the conversion price can be adjusted if we sell shares of our common stock at a price less than per share while the debentures are outstanding 
the conversion price under the debenture also automatically re sets periodically 
during these re set periods  the conversion price will  for five consecutive trading days  adjust to of the average closing price of our stock during the trading days preceding each re set period if this amount is less than the conversion price that would otherwise apply 
the first re set period began on may  and ended may  the next re set period begins on october  and additional re set periods will occur every six months thereafter 
during the first re set period  the investor elected to convert million of the debenture at a re set conversion price of approximately per share 
we elected to pay the investor in cash the million principal amount of the debenture that the investor elected to convert during the first re set period 
up to an additional million of the debentures  plus any unpaid interest on that amount  may be converted at the re set conversion price beginning on october   and any remaining portion of the debenture  plus any unpaid interest  may be converted at the re set conversion price during any subsequent re set period 
we have the right to pay the investor in cash the principal amount of any portion of the debenture the investor elects to convert during a re set period 
if we were to issue shares at of the trading price of our common stock upon conversion of the debenture during a re set period  we would incur a material charge to our statement of operations  based on the difference between the price of our common stock and the value of the common stock at october  in connection with the issuance of the debenture  we issued to the investor a year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share  with the number of shares for which the warrant is exercisable and the exercise price subject to antidilution adjustments 
we have valued the warrant using the black scholes model  with the following assumptions expected life years  risk free interest rate  and volatility 
these factors yield a value of  which will be amortized through may  the last re set period 
the principal amount of the debenture  net of the remaining unamortized warrant value  is classified as a current liability 
at july   the debenture amount repayable was  and the unamortized warrant value was  for a net debenture value of  in addition to the warrant cost  approximately  of debt issuance costs were incurred in the debt transactions noted above 
the unamortized cost of approximately  is included in prepaid expenses and will be amortized as interest expense through may  the last re set period 
in june  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock raising gross proceeds of approximately million before issuance costs of million 
we intend to use offering proceeds in the future to pay any remaining indebtedness under the debenture 
as a result of this offering  the conversion price of our outstanding debenture was adjusted to pursuant to a weighted average adjustment under the terms of the debenture 
in addition  the completion of the offering resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrant and to the number of our shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant pursuant to anti dilution provisions of the warrant 
as so adjusted  the warrant exercise price is and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant is  in addition to the line of credit  our foreign subsidiaries in germany  italy and switzerland have lines of credit with banks in their respective countries that are utilized primarily for overdraft and short term cash needs 
at july   approximately  was outstanding under these lines 
in march  we purchased an acre parcel of land for million in irvine  california  for development of our corporate headquarters facility 
construction commenced in late and was completed in september the cost of the land together with the cost of constructing the facility  including capitalized interest and other carrying costs  is approximately million  including million in capitalized interest costs 
we have leased approximately  square feet of the facility to a tenant for a four year lease term 
we are attempting to lease  square feet of the building  and we are currently considering a variety of other financing options 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to lease the space on favorable or any terms  or that we will be able to obtain any other financing 
on september   our board of directors approved an open market stock repurchase program 
we were authorized to effect repurchases of up to million in shares of our common stock 
we have repurchased a total of  shares at an average cost of per share 
no repurchases were made in the year ended july   and we do not intend to make additional repurchases 
in september  our board terminated the repurchase program 
we are prohibited from repurchasing our stock under the terms of our outstanding debentures 
as is customary in the computer reseller industry  we are contingently liable at july  under the terms of repurchase agreements with several financial institutions providing inventory financing for dealers of our appliances 
under these agreements  dealers purchase our appliances  and the financial institutions agree to pay us for those purchases  less a pre set financing charge  within an agreed payment term 
two of these institutions  finova and ibm credit corporation  have also provided us with vendor inventory financing 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the amount financed  reduced by the resale value of any appliances that may be repurchased  and the risk of loss is spread over several dealers and financial institutions 
at july  and  we were contingently liable for purchases made under these agreements of approximately  and  respectively 
during the three years ended july   we were not required to repurchase any previously sold inventory pursuant to the flooring agreements 
at july   we recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset totaling approximately million 
on december   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of scofima software srl  a company organized under the laws of italy scofima  in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
under our agreement with the former shareholders of scofima  we registered for resale by those shareholders the shares issued to them in the acquisition 
scofima had an option to acquire a software system designed as a caching and content distribution solution 
immediately prior to our acquisition of scofima  scofima exercised their option  and acquired the software system 
the purpose of the software is to provide functionalities that are necessary for the content delivery market of the internet 
the software had been in development for approximately years  involving programmers and system developers 
the software was not complete at the date of acquisition  and was not yet determined to be technologically feasible 
we are currently completing the software and expect to release it in the third quarter of fiscal we issued  shares valued at per share and incurred approximately  in acquisition costs in exchange for the outstanding shares of scofima 
scofima had net assets of approximately  at the date of acquisition 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
we employed an appraiser to identify the values of the assets acquired  including  among other assets  certain in process research and development costs 
the amount of purchase price allocated to in process research and development was determined by estimating the stage of development of the software  estimating future cash flows from projected revenues  and discounting those cash flows to present value 
the discount rate applied was 
the incremental product sales resulting from the products incorporating the software are estimated to be million over the initial four years of sales with sales growing from approximately million in the initial year to million in the fourth year 
the appraiser concluded  and we have determined  that approximately million of the purchase price was related to research and development efforts that had not attained technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was expected 
we have expensed the value of the research and development as of the date of the acquisition of scofima and capitalized the fair value of the other assets acquired as determined and allocated by the appraiser  including the value of the assembled workforce of approximately million and developer relationships valued at million  which will be amortized over years  with the remainder of million assigned to goodwill  which will be amortized over years 
we transact business in various foreign countries  but we only have significant assets deployed outside the united states in germany  italy and switzerland 
we have effected intercompany advances and sold goods to our german subsidiary as well as our subsidiaries in italy and switzerland denominated in us dollars  and those amounts are subject to currency fluctuation  and require constant revaluation on our financial statements 
while a significant reduction in valuation of various currencies such as the euro to which the value of the german mark and the italian lira are pegged and the swiss franc could lead to lower sales as our products become more expensive for foreign customers  we do not believe that the currency fluctuations have had a material impact on our liquidity 
our reported sales can be affected by changes in the currency rates in effect in any particular period 
also  these foreign currency fluctuations can cause us to report more or less in sales by virtue of the translation of the subsidiary s sales into us dollars at an average rate in effect throughout the year 
also  we have funded operational losses of our subsidiaries of approximately million since we purchased them  and if our subsidiaries continue to incur operational losses  our cash and liquidity would be negatively impacted 
we expect to have sufficient cash generated from operations and from our recently completed common stock offering to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which defines derivatives  requires that all derivatives be carried at fair value  and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met 
this statement is effective for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended  sab which was effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  sfas also specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill  noting that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for separately 
sfas will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas immediately  except with regard to business combinations initiated prior to july   which it expects to account for using the pooling of interests method  and sfas is effective august  furthermore  any goodwill and any intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life that are acquired in a purchase business combination completed after june  will not be amortized  but will continue to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the appropriate pre sfas accounting literature 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to the adoption of sfas sfas will require upon adoption of sfas  that the company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  the company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
in addition  to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life  the company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas within the first interim period 
any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas will require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company must identify its reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the company will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the company must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  the company must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of it assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s statement of earnings 
and finally  any unamortized negative goodwill existing at the date sfas is adopted must be written off as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of the date of adoption  the company expects to have unamortized goodwill in the amount of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of  all of which will be subject to the transition provisions of sfas and amortization expense related to goodwill was   and  for the years ended july   and  respectively 
because of the extensive effort needed to comply with adopting sfas and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these statements on the company s financial statements at the date of this report  including whether any transitional impairment losses will be required to be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

there are other storage technologies in use  including storage area network technology  which provide an alternative to network attached storage 
we are not able to predict how the data storage market will evolve 
for example  it is not clear whether usage of a number of different solutions will grow and co exist in the marketplace or whether one or a small number of solutions will be dominant and displace the others 
it is also not clear whether network attached storage technology will emerge as a dominant or even prevalent solution 
whether nas becomes an accepted standard will be due to factors outside our control 
if a solution other than network attached storage emerges as the standard in the data storage market  growth in the network attached storage market may not meet our expectations 
in such event  our growth and the price of our stock would suffer 
if growth in the nas market does not meet our expectations  our future financial performance could suffer 
we believe our future financial performance will depend in large part upon the continued growth in the nas market and on emerging standards in this market 
we intend for nas products to be our primary business 
the market for nas products  however  may not continue to grow 
long term trends in storage technology remain unclear and some analysts have questioned whether competing technologies  such as storage area networks  may emerge as the preferred storage solution 
if the nas market grows more slowly than anticipated  or if nas products based on emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by the market  our operating results could be harmed 
the revenue and profit potential of nas products is unproven  and we may be unable to attain revenue growth or profitability for our nas product lines 
nas technology is relatively recent  and our ability to be successful in the nas market may be negatively affected by not only a lack of growth of the nas market but also the lack of market acceptance of our nas products 
additionally  we may be unable to achieve profitability as we transition to a greater emphasis on nas products 
if we fail to successfully manage our transition to a focus on nas products  our business and prospects would be harmed 
we began developing nas products in since then  we have focused our efforts and resources on our nas business  and we intend to continue to do so 
we expect to continue to wind down our non nas product development and marketing efforts 
in the interim  we expect to continue to rely in part upon sales of our non nas products to fund operating and development expenses 
net sales of our non nas products have been declining in amount and as a percentage of our overall net sales  and we expect these declines to continue 
if the decline in net sales of our non nas products varies significantly from our expectations  or the decline in net sales of our non nas products is not substantially offset by increases in sales of our nas products  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations or to develop our nas business 
we also expect our transition to a nas focused business to require us to continue engaging in significant marketing and sales efforts to achieve market awareness as a nas vendor  reallocating resources in product development and service and support of our nas appliances  modifying existing and entering into new channel partner relationships to include sales of our nas appliances  and expanding and reconfiguring manufacturing operations 
in addition  we may face unanticipated challenges in implementing our transition to a nas focused company 
we may not be successful in managing any anticipated or unanticipated challenges associated with this transition 
moreover  we expect to continue to incur costs in addressing these challenges  and there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover these costs 
if we fail to successfully implement our transition to a nas focused company  our business and prospects would be harmed 
the recent terrorist attacks may have an adverse effect on our business 
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington  dc on september  appear to be having an adverse effect on business  financial and general economic conditions 
these effects may  in turn  have an adverse effect on our business and results and operations 
at this time  however  we are not able to predict the nature  extent and duration of these effects on overall economic conditions or on our business and operating results 
the california energy crisis is causing us to experience significantly higher energy costs and occasional interruptions in our supply of electrical power  which could disrupt our business  harm our operating results and depress the price of our common stock 
california is currently experiencing a shortage of electrical power and other energy sources 
this shortage has resulted in significantly higher electricity and other energy costs and has occasionally resulted in rolling brown outs  or the temporary and generally unannounced loss of the primary electrical power source 
the computer and manufacturing equipment and other systems in our headquarters in irvine  california  are powered by electricity 
currently  we do not have secondary electrical power sources to mitigate the impacts of temporary or longer term electrical outages 
it is not anticipated that the energy shortages will abate soon  therefore  we expect to continue to experience higher costs for electricity and other energy sources  as well as brown outs and black outs 
we may also become subject to usage restrictions or other energy consumption regulations that could adversely impact or disrupt our manufacturing and other activities 
continued higher energy costs could materially harm our profitability and depress the price of our common stock 
in addition  if we experience interruptions in our supply of electricity  our manufacturing and other operations would be disrupted  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and depress the price of our common stock 
due to deteriorating us and world economic conditions  information technology spending on data storage and other capital equipment could decline 
if technology spending is reduced  our sales and operating results could be harmed 
many of our customers are affected by economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world 
many companies have announced that they will reduce their spending on data storage and other capital equipment 
if spending on data storage technology products is reduced by customers and potential customers  our sales could be harmed  and we may experience greater pressures on our gross margins 
if economic conditions do not improve  or if our customers reduce their overall information technology purchases  our sales  gross profits and operating results may be reduced 
if we fail to increase the number of direct and indirect sales channels for our nas products  our ability to increase net sales may be limited 
in order to grow our business  we will need to increase market awareness and sales of our nas appliances 
to achieve these objectives  we believe it will be necessary to increase the number of our direct and indirect sales channels 
we plan to increase the number of our field sales personnel 
however  there is intense competition for these professionals  and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient new sales personnel 
we also plan to expand revenues from our indirect sales channels  including distributors  vars  and systems integrators 
to do this  we will need to modify and expand our existing relationships with these indirect channel partners  as well as enter into new indirect sales channel relationships 
we may not be successful in accomplishing these objectives 
if we are unable to expand our direct or indirect sales channels  our ability to increase revenues may be limited 
because we do not have exclusive relationships with our distributors or resellers  such as ingram micro  tech data  compucom and custom edge  these customers may give higher priority to products of competitors  which could harm our operating results 
our distributors and resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including products of our competitors 
accordingly  these distributors and resellers  such as ingram micro  tech data  compucom  and custom edge may give higher priority to products of our competitors  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  our distributors and resellers often demand additional significant selling concessions and inventory rights  such as limited return rights and price protection 
we cannot assure you that sales to our distributors or resellers will continue  or that these sales will be profitable 
because we have only approximately four years of operating history in the nas market  which is new and rapidly evolving  our historical financial information is of limited value in projecting our future operating results or prospects 
we have been manufacturing and selling our nas products for only approximately four years 
for the years ended july   and  these products accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales  respectively 
we expect sales of our nas products to represent an increasing percentage of our net sales in the future 
because our operating history in the nas product market is only approximately four years  as well as the rapidly evolving nature of the nas market  it is difficult to evaluate our business or our prospects 
in particular  our historical financial information is of limited value in projecting our future operating results 
markets for both our nas appliances and our non nas products are intensely competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may lose market share or be required to reduce prices 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could harm our operating results 
we compete with other nas companies  direct selling storage providers and smaller vendors that provide storage solutions to end users 
in our non nas markets  we compete with computer manufacturers that provide storage upgrades for their own products  as well as with manufacturers of hard drives  cd servers and arrays and storage upgrade products 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products  and reduce prices to increase market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  new technologies may increase competitive pressures 
we depend on a few customers  including distributors such as ingram micro and tech data and specialized end users  for a substantial portion of our net sales and accounts receivable  and changes in the timing and size of these customers orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
three customers accounted for approximately and of our total accounts receivable at july  and july   respectively  and one customer accounted for approximately and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively  while another customer  storway  a european storage service provider  accounted for of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal   and  we sold our non nas products principally to distributors and master resellers such as ingram micro  tech data  custom edge previously inacom and compucom 
unless and until we diversify and expand our customer base for nas products  our future success will depend to a large extent on the timing and size of future purchase orders  if any  from these customers 
in addition  we expect that single site purchasers of large installations of our nas products will purchase large volumes of our nas products over relatively short periods of time 
this will cause both our sales and our accounts receivable to be highly concentrated and significantly dependent on one or only a few customers  as has occurred in fiscal year if we lose a major customer  or if one of our customers significantly reduces its purchasing volume or experiences financial difficulties and is unable to or does not pay amounts owed to us  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our reserves for accounts receivable by million 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenues in past periods will continue to purchase our products or fully pay for products they purchase in future periods 
our gross margins of our various product lines have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
for example  we may see reduced sales of higher margin cd servers or notebook upgrade products and we may not see increased sales of our nas appliances 
historically  our gross margins have fluctuated significantly 
our gross margins vary significantly by product line and distribution channel  and  therefore  our overall gross margin varies with the mix of products we sell 
our markets are characterized by intense competition and declining average unit selling prices over the course of the relatively short life cycles of individual products 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from disk drives  cd servers and arrays  and storage upgrade products 
the market for these products is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures 
some of these products  such as cd servers and arrays and some laptop storage upgrade systems  have historically generated high gross margins  although we have experienced significant declines in sales of these products 
sales of disk drive upgrade systems generally generate lower gross margins than those of our nas products 
if we fail to increase sales of our nas appliances  or if demand  sales or gross margins for cd servers and arrays and our laptop storage upgrade systems decline rapidly  we believe our overall gross margins will continue to decline 
our gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors  including new product introductions and enhancements  competition  changes in the distribution channels we use  the mix and average selling prices of products  and the cost and availability of components and manufacturing labor 
if we are unable to timely introduce cost effective hardware or software solutions for nas environments  or if our products fail to keep pace with technological changes in the markets we serve  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our future growth will depend in large part upon our ability to successfully develop and introduce new hardware and software for the nas market 
due to the complexity of products such as ours  and the difficulty in estimating the engineering effort required to produce new products  we face significant challenges in developing and introducing new products 
we may be unable to introduce new products on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to introduce new products in a timely manner  our operating results could be harmed 
even if we are successful in introducing new products  we may be unable to keep pace with technological changes in our markets and our products may not gain any meaningful market acceptance 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements that could render our products obsolete and less competitive 
as a result  our position in these markets could erode rapidly due to changes in features and functions of competing products or price reductions by our competitors 
in order to avoid product obsolescence  we will have to keep pace with rapid technological developments and emerging industry standards 
we may not be successful in doing so  and if we fail in this regard  our operating results could be harmed 
we rely upon a limited number of suppliers for several key components used in our products  including disk drives  computer boards  power supplies  microprocessors and other components  and any disruption or termination of these supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and harm our operating results 
we rely upon a limited number of suppliers of several key components used in our products  including disk drives  computer boards  power supplies and microprocessors 
in the past  we have experienced periodic shortages  selective supply allocations and increased prices for these and other components 
we may experience similar supply issues in the future 
even if we are able to obtain component supplies  the quality of these components may not meet our requirements 
for example  in order to meet our product performance requirements  we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity 
even a small deviation from our requirements could render any of the disk drives we receive unusable by us 
in the event of a reduction or interruption in the supply or a degradation in quality of any of our components  we may not be able to complete the assembly of our products on a timely basis or at all  which could force us to delay or reduce shipments of our products 
if we were forced to delay or reduce product shipments  our operating results could be harmed 
in addition  product shipment delays could adversely affect our relationships with our channel partners and current or future end users 
undetected defects or errors found in our products  or the failure of our products to properly interface with the products of other vendors  may result in delays  increased costs or failure to achieve market acceptance  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
complex products such as those we develop and offer may contain defects or errors  or may fail to properly interface with the products of other vendors  when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite internal testing and testing by our customers or potential customers  we do  from time to time  and may in the future encounter these problems in our existing or future products 
any of these problems may cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications  or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products  which could result in product returns 
in addition  we may not find errors or failures in our products until after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could significantly harm our operating results 
our current or potential customers might seek or succeed in recovering from us any losses resulting from errors or failures in our products 
if we are unable to manage our international operations effectively  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
net sales to our international customers  including export sales from the united states  accounted for approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended july     respectively 
we believe that our growth and profitability will require successful expansion of our international operations to which we have committed significant resources 
our international operations will expose us to operational challenges that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our operations only in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  particularly when we sell our products in denominations other than us dollars  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  particularly in asia  legal uncertainties regarding tariffs  export controls and other trade barriers  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  and seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns in other countries  particularly in europe 
any of these factors could have an adverse impact on our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets 
for example  our reported sales can be affected by changes in the currency rates in effect during any particular period 
the effects of currency fluctuations were evident in our results of operations for the fiscal year during this period  the euro and two currencies whose values are pegged to the euro  fluctuated significantly against the us dollar 
as a result  we incurred a foreign currency loss of approximately  in the first quarter of fiscal  a foreign currency gain of  in the second quarter of fiscal  and foreign currency losses of  and  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
also  these currency fluctuations can cause us to report higher or lower sales by virtue of the translation of the subsidiary s sales into us dollars at an average rate in effect throughout the fiscal year 
in addition  we have funded operational losses of our subsidiaries of approximately million between the date of purchase and july   and if our subsidiaries continue to incur operational losses  our cash and liquidity would be negatively impacted 
in order to successfully expand our international sales  we must strengthen foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international distributors and resellers 
expanding internationally and managing the financial and business operations of our foreign subsidiaries will also require significant management attention and financial resources 
for example  our foreign subsidiaries in europe have incurred operational losses 
to the extent that we are unable to address these concerns in a timely manner  our growth  if any  in international sales will be limited  and our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our proprietary software relies on our intellectual property  and any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could enable our competitors to market products with similar features that may reduce demand for our products  which would adversely affect our net sales 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary software or technology 
we believe the protection of our proprietary technology is important to our business 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we currently rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and license agreements with end users and control access to our source code and other intellectual property 
we have applied for the registration of some  but not all  of our trademarks 
we have applied for us patents with respect to the design and operation of our netforce product  and we anticipate that we may apply for additional patents 
it is possible that no patents will issue from our currently pending applications 
new patent applications may not result in issued patents and may not provide us with any competitive advantages over  or may be challenged by  third parties 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries  and the enforcement of those laws  do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patent issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this litigation  whether or not it is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid  and if we were to subsequently lose our intellectual property rights  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we may from time to time receive claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
for example  we have been notified by intel corporation that our products may infringe some of the intellectual property rights of intel 
in its notification  intel offered us a non exclusive license for patents in their portfolio 
we are investigating whether our products infringe the patents of intel  and we have had discussions with intel regarding this matter 
we do not believe that we infringe the patents of intel  but our discussions and our investigation are ongoing  and we expect we will continue discussions with intel 
we cannot assure you that intel would not be successful in asserting a successful claim of infringement  or if we were to seek a license from intel regarding its patents  that intel would continue to offer us a non exclusive license on any terms 
we expect that companies in our markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
the resolution of any claims of this nature  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could harm our operating results 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the loss of access to any key intellectual property right could harm our business 
our net sales and operating results may fluctuate significantly  and any fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in recent periods  we have experienced significant declines in net sales and gross profit and incurred operating losses  causing our quarterly operating results to vary significantly 
if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  as well as our internal operating goals  as a result of any future fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our net sales and quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors 
these factors include market acceptance of our new products and product enhancements or those of our competitors  the level of competition in our target product markets  delays in our introduction of new products  changes in sales volumes through our distribution channels  which have varying commission and sales discount structures  changing technological needs within our target product markets  the impact of price competition on the selling prices for our non nas products  which continue to represent a majority of our net sales  the availability and pricing of our product components  our expenditures on research and development and the cost to expand our sales and marketing programs  and the volume  mix and timing of orders received 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  it is difficult for us to forecast accurately our future net sales 
this difficulty results from our limited operating history in the emerging nas market  as well as the fact that product sales in any quarter are generally booked and shipped in that quarter 
because we incur expenses  many of which are fixed  based in part on our expectations of future sales  our operating results may be disproportionately affected if sales levels are below our expectations 
our revenues in any quarter may also be affected by product returns and any warranty obligations in that quarter 
many of our distribution and reseller customers have limited return rights 
in addition  we generally extend warranties to our customers that correspond to the warranties provided by our suppliers 
if returns exceed applicable reserves or if a supplier were to fail to meet its warranty obligations  we could incur significant losses 
in fiscal and  we experienced product return rates of approximately and  respectively 
this rate may vary significantly in the future  and we cannot assure you that our reserves for product returns will be adequate in any future period 
if we are unable to attract qualified personnel or retain our executive officers and other key personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully 
our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
competition for qualified engineers and sales personnel  particularly in orange county  california  is intense  and we may not be able to compete effectively to retain and attract qualified  experienced employees 
should we lose the services of a significant number of our engineers or sales people  we may not be able to compete successfully in our targeted markets and our business would be harmed 
we believe that our success will depend on the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees 
in particular  we rely on the services of our four founders  messrs 
razmjoo  alaghband  aydin and shahrestany 
we maintain employment agreements with each of our founders 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on these individuals 
the loss of any of these executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability  and our failure to do so could require us to seek additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable or any terms 
in recent periods  we have experienced significant declines in net sales and gross profit  and we have incurred operating losses 
we incurred operating losses of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million including a charge for in process research and development in fiscal year we expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least the third quarter of fiscal as part of our strategy to focus on the nas market  we plan to increase our field sales force 
we will need to increase our revenues from our nas products to achieve and maintain profitability 
the revenue and profit potential of these products is unproven 
we may not be able to generate significant or any revenues from our nas products or achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
if we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future  we will have to seek additional financing in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable or any terms 
control by our existing shareholders could discourage potential acquisitions of our business that other shareholders may consider favorable 
as of october   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately  shares  or approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
acting together  these shareholders would be able to exert substantial influence on matters requiring approval by shareholders  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which could in turn have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
the market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future  which could result in a decline in your investment s value 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile in the past  and particularly volatile in the last twelve months  and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the value of your investment in our common stock could decline due to the impact of any of the above or of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our operating results  fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  a shortfall in net sales or operating results compared to securities analysts expectations  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  announcements of new products  applications or product enhancements by us or our competitors  and changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers  including failures by customers to pay amounts owed to us 
we have issued convertible debentures  and the obligations of the debentures pose risks to the price of our common stock and our operations 
on october   we issued year million convertible debentures to a private investor 
the debentures provide that  in certain circumstances  the holder of the debentures may convert their position into our stock  or demand that we repay outstanding amounts with cash 
the terms and conditions of the debentures pose unique and special risks to our operations and the price of our common stock 
some of those risks are discussed in more detail below 
our issuance of stock upon the conversion of the debentures and the exercise of the warrants  as well as additional sales of our common stock by the investor  may depress the price of our common stock and substantially dilute your shares 
we have registered for resale by the investor in our debentures a total of  shares of our common stock 
this number represents approximately of the number of shares of our common stock issuable if our debentures were to remain outstanding until their stated maturity on october  and all interest on the debentures were to be paid in shares of our stock valued at per share  the closing price of our stock on april   plus the number of shares of our common stock issuable if the investor s warrant were to be exercised in full 
as is noted in the risk factor immediately below  if the investor were to convert the debentures during a period when the re set conversion price is in effect  we could be required to issue a substantially greater number of our shares to the investor 
the issuance of all or any significant portion of the shares of our common stock that we have registered for resale  together with any additional shares that we may be required to register for resale if the debentures are converted during a period when the re set conversion price is in effect  could result in substantial dilution to the interests of our other shareholders and a decrease in the price of our stock 
a decline in the price of our common stock could encourage short sales of our stock  which could place further downward pressure on the price of our stock 
the conversion price under the debentures will automatically re set periodically 
if the investor converts some or all of the debentures during the reset periods and we do not repay in cash the debentures that the investor then desires to convert  we will have to issue shares substantially in excess of those originally contemplated  and those additional shares will dilute your shares 
the conversion price under the debentures will automatically re set periodically 
during these re set periods  the conversion price will  for five consecutive trading days  adjust to of the average closing price of our stock during the trading days preceding each re set period if this amount is less than the conversion price that would otherwise apply 
the first re set period began on may  and ended on may  the next re set period begins on october  and additional re set periods will occur every six months thereafter 
during the first re set period  the investor elected to convert million of the debentures at a re set conversion price of approximately per share 
we have paid the investor in cash the million principal amount of the debentures that the investor elected to convert during the first re set period 
up to an additional million of the debentures  plus any unpaid interest on that amount  may be converted at the re set conversion price beginning on october   and any remaining debentures  plus any unpaid interest  may be converted at the re set conversion price during any subsequent re set period 
we have received a notice that the investor intends to seek payment or conversion of the payment  due on october  we intend to make a payment in cash to satisfy any investor demand 
we have the right to pay the investor in cash the principal amount of any portion of the debentures the investor elects to convert during a re set period 
if we do not elect to pay cash to satisfy any future conversions of the remaining portion of the debentures during subsequent re set periods  the number of shares of our common stock that we would be required to issue upon conversion of the remaining portion of the debentures at the re set conversion price could be substantial 
for example  if the trading day average of our shares preceding a re set period were to be 
per share  which is lower than the lowest closing price reached by our shares since the date the debentures were issued  the re set conversion price would be approximately 
per share 
if the remaining million principal amount of the debentures were to be converted at this price  we would be required to issue the investor approximately  shares  which would result in the investor owning of our outstanding stock after giving effect to such issuance to the investor 
we will record a charge if the debentures are converted at a conversion price that is less than  or if we satisfy an investor demand for repayment or conversion 
if we issue shares of our common stock at a conversion price that is less than per share  we will record a charge to our statement of operations in an amount equal to the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature 
this value would be determined by subtracting the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable portion of the debentures at a conversion price of from the number of shares issuable upon conversion of that portion of the debentures at the lower conversion price  and multiplying the difference by  the closing price of our common stock on the date we issued the debentures 
any such charge  if recorded  would be a material non cash charge and would not affect our net shareholders equity 
in june  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock raising gross proceeds of approximately million before issuance costs of million 
as a result of this offering  the conversion price of our outstanding debenture was adjusted to pursuant to a weighted average adjustment under the terms of the debenture 
in addition  the completion of the offering resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price of the warrant and to the number of our shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant pursuant to anti dilution provisions of the warrant 
as so adjusted  the warrant exercise price is and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant is  also  we are amortizing certain debt issuance costs and the cost of the warrant we issued to the investor 
these costs will be amortized as interest expense through may  the last re set period 
at july   the amount relating to unamortized debt issuance costs and warrant costs was approximately if our shares are issued to the investor  those shares may be sold into the market  which could depress the price of our stock and encourage short sales of our stock 
to the extent the debentures are converted or interest on the debentures is paid in shares of our common stock rather than cash  a significant number of these shares of our common stock may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of our common stock and encourage short sales 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
in that case  we could be required to issue an increasingly greater number of shares of our common stock upon future conversions of the debentures as a result of the adjustments described above  sales of which could further depress the price of our common stock 
the debentures provide for various events of default that would entitle the investor to require us to repay the entire amount owed in cash within three days 
if an event of default occurs  we may be unable to immediately repay the amount owed  and any repayment may leave us with little or no working capital in our business

if an event of default occurs  the investor can require us to repurchase all or any portion of the principal amount of any outstanding debentures at a repurchase price equal to the greater of of such outstanding principal amount  plus all accrued but unpaid interest on such outstanding debentures through the date of payment  or the total value of all of our shares issuable upon conversion of such outstanding debentures  valued based on the average closing price of our common stock for the preceding five trading days  plus any accrued but unpaid interest on such outstanding debentures 
in addition  upon an event of default under the debentures  the investor could also require us to repurchase from the investor any of our shares of common stock issued to the investor upon conversion of the debentures within the preceding days  which would be valued at the average closing price of our common stock over the preceding five trading days 
we would be required to complete these repurchases no later than the third trading day following the date an event of default notice is delivered to us 
at july   we are in default under a financial covenant of the cit loan agreement  although there is no amount outstanding under this loan agreement 
the investor has informally advised us that it will not declare an event of default under the debenture as long as there is no amount outstanding under the cit loan agreement 
if we were required to make a default payment at a time when all of the remaining million principal amount of the debentures were outstanding  the payment required would be a minimum of million and could be substantially greater depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time 
in addition  if we default in the timely performance of specified obligations under our registration rights agreement with the investor  we would also be obligated to pay as liquidated damages to the investor an amount equal to  each month until any such default is cured 
some of the events of default include matters over which we may have some  little or no control  such as various corporate transactions in which the control of our company changes  or if our common stock ceases to be listed on a trading market 
if an event of default occurs  we may be unable to repay any part or all of the entire amount in cash 
any such repayment could leave us with little or no working capital for our business 
the payment to brighton capital  ltd 
in connection with our sale of our convertible debentures may be inconsistent with the provisions of section of the securities exchange act and may enable the investor to rescind its investment 
we paid brighton capital  ltd 
 for its introduction to us of the purchaser of our convertible debentures 
in march  the staff of the securities and exchange commission informed us that the receipt by brighton capital of this payment may be inconsistent with the registration provisions of section of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
if this payment were determined to be inconsistent with section  then  under section of the securities exchange act montrose investments lp  the purchaser of our debentures  might have the right to rescind its purchase of these securities  which would require us to repay to montrose investments lp the million that it invested in us  we might be subject to regulatory action  and we might be able to recover the  fee that we paid to brighton capital in connection with the transaction 
the debentures restrict our ability to raise additional equity without the consent of the investor  which could hinder our efforts to obtain additional necessary financing to operate our business or to repay the debenture holders 
the agreements we executed when we issued these debentures prohibit us from obtaining additional equity or equity equivalent financing for a period of trading days after the effective date may  of the registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the debentures  we would not  without the investor s consent  obtain additional equity or equity equivalent financing unless we first offer the investor the opportunity to provide such financing upon the terms and conditions proposed 
these restrictions have several exceptions  such as issuances of options to employees and directors  strategic transactions and acquisitions and bona fide public offerings with gross proceeds exceeding million 
the restrictions described in this paragraph may make it extremely difficult to raise additional equity capital during this day period 
we may need to raise such additional capital  and if we are unable to do so  we may have little or no working capital for our business  and the market price of our stock may decline 
we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we do not obtain shareholder approval for issuance of our common stock  or if we are unable to timely register these shares 
we are subject to national association of securities dealers rule  which generally requires shareholder approval of any transaction that would result in the issuance of securities representing or more of an issuer s outstanding listed securities 
upon conversion or the payment of interest on debentures we are not able to issue more than  shares  or of our outstanding common stock on october   the day prior to the date of issuance of the debentures 
the terms of the convertible debentures purchase agreement also provide that the shareholder desiring to convert has the option of requiring us either to seek shareholder approval within days of the request or to pay the converting holder the monetary value of the debentures that cannot be converted  at a premium to the converting holder 
if the shareholder requires that we convert the debentures into shares and we have not obtained the requisite shareholder approval within days  we would be obligated to pay the monetary value to the purchaser as liquidated damages 
also  under the terms of the registration rights agreement  we will incur liquidated damages of approximately  per month if the investor is not permitted  for five or more trading days  to sell our shares under our registration statement covering the resale of those shares or under any replacement registration statement that we may file 
even if we never issue our stock upon the conversion of the debentures or upon exercise of the investor s warrants  we may issue additional shares  which would reduce your ownership percentage and dilute the value of your shares 
other events over which you have no control could result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  which would dilute your ownership percentage 
our issuance of  shares in connection with the acquisition of scofima software srl is an example of an issuance of additional shares to finance an acquisition that may dilute your ownership 
also in june  we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock in an offering 
in the future  we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions  upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options  warrants and shares of convertible preferred stock  or in lieu of cash payment of dividends 
our issuance of additional shares would dilute your shares

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio as well as the fluctuation in interest rates on our various borrowing arrangements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure reasonable portfolio liquidity 
as discussed elsewhere in this report on form k  construction of our headquarters in irvine  california was completed in september total costs for the headquarters facility  including land costs  were approximately million 
we may be seeking long term mortgage financing for all or some of the facility cost during the next fiscal year 
we have not locked in a commitment  and may therefore find such financing to be much more expensive as a result 
since july   we have entered into a line of credit and term loan agreements pursuant to which amounts outstanding bear interest at the lender s prime rate plus up to 
accordingly  if we were to borrow funds under such agreements  we expect that we will experience interest rate risk on our debt 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign countries  but we only have significant assets deployed outside the united states in germany 
we have effected intercompany advances and sold goods to our german subsidiary  as well as our subsidiaries in italy and switzerland  denominated in us dollars  and those amounts are subject to currency fluctuation and require constant revaluation on our financial statements 
in fiscal  and  we incurred approximately   and  respectively  in foreign currency losses which are included in our selling  general and administrative costs 
we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the euro  the german mark  or the italian lira compared to the us dollar 
if such a change did occur  we would have to take into account a currency exchange gain or loss in the amount of the change in the us dollar denominated balance of the amounts outstanding at the time of such change 
our net sales can also be affected by a change in the exchange rate because we translate sales of our subsidiaries at the average rate in effect during a financial reporting period 
at july   approximately million in current intercompany advances and accounts receivable from our foreign subsidiaries were outstanding 
we can not assure you that we will not sustain a significant loss if a rapid or unpredicted change in value of the euro or related european currencies should occur 
we can not assure you that such a loss would not have an adverse material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
