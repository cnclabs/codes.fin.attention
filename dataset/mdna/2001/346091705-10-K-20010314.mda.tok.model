item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
on december   forest completed its merger with forcenergy inc forcenergy 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
under this method of accounting  the recorded assets and liabilities of forest and forcenergy were carried forward to the combined company at their recorded amounts  and income of the combined company includes income of forest and forcenergy for the entire year 
the results of operations of forcenergy prior to december   the effective date of its reorganization and fresh start reporting  are not included in the financial statements of the combined company 
results of operations net earnings for were  compared to net earnings of  in exclusive of unusual or non recurring items  net earnings were  for compared to  in items excluded from this computation consist of merger related expenses of  net of tax in  impairment of oil and gas properties of  in  non cash foreign currency translation losses of  in  a one time tax credit of  in  non cash foreign currency translation gains of  in and an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in the improvement in earnings was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the merger with forcenergy and higher product prices 
net earnings for were  compared to a net loss of  in exclusive of unusual or non recurring items  net earnings were  for compared to a net loss of  in items excluded from the computation consist of a writedown of oil and gas properties of   pre tax  non cash foreign currency translation losses of  and an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt of  the improvement in earnings was due primarily to higher prices and lower depletion expense 
marketing and processing revenue increased by to  in from  in  and the related marketing and processing expense increased by to  in from  in the previous year 
the gross margin for marketing and processing activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease in the margin is due primarily to lower margins on processing activities in the united states 
marketing and processing revenue increased by to  in from  in and the related marketing and processing expense increased by to  in from  in the previous year 
the gross margin reported for marketing and processing activities decreased to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from the effects of an increasingly competitive market which caused trading margins to tighten  and lower gas processing income due to the sale of processing facilities in the first quarter of oil and gas sales revenue increased by to  in from  in due primarily to higher production volumes resulting from the merger with forcenergy and higher oil and gas prices 
the average sales prices received for natural gas and liquids in increased and  respectively  compared to the average sales prices received in production volumes on an mmcfe basis were higher in compared to oil and gas sales revenue increased by to  in from  in due primarily to higher natural gas and liquids prices 
the average sales prices received for natural gas and liquids in increased and  respectively  compared to the average sales prices received in production volumes for natural gas and liquids on an mcfe basis were less than higher in compared to oil and gas production expense increased to  in from  in on an mmcfe basis  production expense was 
per mcfe in compared to 
per mcfe in the increase in expense and per unit rates are due primarily to higher operating costs associated with forcenergy properties  higher production taxes and increased workover activity 
oil and gas production expense increased to  in from  in  due primarily to non recurring direct operating expenses and expensed workovers 
on an mcfe basis  production expense was 
per mcfe in compared to 
in the increase in the per unit expense is attributable to higher costs being spread over essentially the same production base 
production volumes  weighted average sales prices and production expenses for the years ended december   and for forest and its subsidiaries were as follows years ended december  natural gas production mmcf    sales price received per mcf effects of energy swaps per mcf 
average sales price per mcf liquids oil and condensate production mbbls    sales price received per bbl effects of energy swaps per bbl average sales price per bbl natural gas liquids production mbbls   average sales price per bbl total liquids production mbbls    average sales price per bbl total production production volumes mmcfe    average sales price per mcfe operating expense per mcfe netback per mcfe financial data for and have been restated to reflect the reclassification of transportation costs from oil and gas revenue to oil and gas production expense to comply with a recent accounting pronouncement 
energy swaps were entered into to hedge the price of spot market volumes against price fluctuations 
hedged natural gas volumes were  mmcf   mmcf and  mmcf in  and  respectively 
hedged oil and condensate volumes were  barrels   barrels and  barrels in  and  respectively 
the aggregate net gains losses under energy swap agreements were   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and and were accounted for as increases reductions to oil and gas sales 
general and administrative expense increased to  in compared to  in the increase was due primarily to general and administrative expenses related to forcenergy operations in general and administrative expense decreased to  in compared to  in the period included approximately  of non recurring expenses of a canadian subsidiary  saxon petroleum inc  as a result of its decision to investigate strategic alternatives  whereas the period reflected the efficiencies achieved by combining saxon s operations with those of canadian forest 
total overhead costs capitalized and expensed general and administrative costs were  in   in and  in total overhead costs increased in compared to due primarily to overhead attributable to forcenergy operations  and decreased by in compared to the following table summarizes total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  in thousands overhead costs capitalized    general and administrative costs expensed    total overhead costs    number of salaried employees at end of year includes   and  in  and  respectively  related to marketing and processing operations 
merger and seismic licensing costs of  in include banking  legal  accounting  printing and other consulting costs related to the merger  severance paid to terminated employees  expenses for office closures  employee relocation  data migration and systems integration  and costs of transferring seismic licenses from forcenergy to forest 
depreciation and depletion expense increased to  in from  in due primarily to increased production as a result of the merger with forcenergy and an increased per unit rate 
the depletion rate increased to per mcfe in compared to 
per mcfe in  due primarily to higher finding costs in and higher than anticipated future development costs in the current inflationary environment for oilfield services 
depreciation and depletion expense decreased to  in from  in due to a lower per unit rate 
the depletion rate decreased to 
per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in this decline is attributable to favorable per unit costs associated with acquisitions and gulf of mexico discoveries  as well as to writedowns of oil and gas properties in the third and fourth quarters of at december  forest had undeveloped properties with a cost basis of approximately  in the united states and  in canada which were not subject to depletion  compared to  in the united states and  in canada at december  and  in the united states and  in canada at december  the increase in is due primarily to wells in progress in alaska  offset partially by surrendered and abandoned leases 
the increase in compared to is due primarily to undeveloped properties acquired in the merger with forcenergy and to wells in progress in canada 
forest also had capitalized costs related to international interests of approximately   and  at december   and  respectively  which were not being depleted pending establishment of proved reserves 
in the fourth quarter of  forest recorded an impairment of  related to unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled in switzerland and thailand 
in the third and fourth quarters of  forest recorded writedowns of its oil and gas properties pursuant to the ceiling test limitation prescribed by the securities and exchange commission for companies using the full cost method of accounting 
the writedowns totaled   pre tax and were primarily a result of declining oil and gas prices 
additional writedowns of the full cost pools in the united states and canada may be required if oil and gas prices decline  undeveloped property values decrease  estimated proved reserve volumes are revised downward or costs incurred in exploration  development  or acquisition activities in the respective full cost pools exceed the discounted future net cash flows from the additional reserves  if any  attributable to each of the cost pools 
other income of  in included interest income of approximately  equity income of approximately  from a pipeline investment and a gain of approximately  from the sale of an investment  offset partially by approximately  of franchise taxes and approximately  of unsuccessful acquisition costs 
other income of  in included a gain of approximately  from the sale of gas processing facilities in the first quarter of other income of  in included approximately  before tax relating to a gas contract settlement in canada and  of death benefits received under a life insurance policy covering a former executive officer 
interest expense of  in increased  or compared to due primarily to the merger with forcenergy 
interest expense of  in increased  or compared to due primarily to the issuance of the senior subordinated notes due the notes  partially offset by lower bank debt balances 
foreign currency translation gains losses were  in   in and  in foreign currency translation gains and losses relate to translation of the notes issued by canadian forest  and are attributable to the increases and decreases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the period 
the value of the canadian dollar was 
per us at december  compared to 
at december   
at december  and 
at december  forest is required to recognize the noncash foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the notes because the debt is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of canadian forest is the canadian dollar 
income tax expense of  was recognized in compared to income tax benefits of  in and  in the changes are attributable primarily to improvements in profitability 
expense of  in represents expense of  attributable to united states operations and  recorded by canadian forest  offset by an income tax benefit of  attributable to expected utilization of the deferred income tax assets of forest 
realization of forcenergy s fresh start deferred tax assets was required to be recorded as an adjustment of additional paid in capital 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in resulted from redemption of  remaining principal amount of senior subordinated notes at of par value 
the extraordinary gain of  on extinguishment of debt in resulted from settlement of forest s remaining nonrecourse production payment obligation in exchange for  shares of forest common stock valued at  liquidity and capital resources forest has historically addressed its long term liquidity needs through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit  and through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production will significantly impact future operating cash flows 
no prediction can be made as to the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
we continue to examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities of forest  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond forest s control 
securities repurchases 
during  we repurchased  shares of forest common stock and  principal amount of subordinated notes 
bank credit facilities 
in connection with the merger with forcenergy  forest and its subsidiaries  canadian forest and promark  negotiated a new global credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by the chase manhattan bank and the chase manhattan bank of canada 
this facility replaced the senior facilities of forest and forcenergy and was effective on december   the date of completion of the merger 
due to the recent upgrade in forest s bank credit facility rating  the borrowing base limitations previously imposed upon us were removed 
as such  the current global credit facility commitments and borrowing limits in the united states and canada are  and  respectively 
if forest s bank credit facility rating is downgraded  the ability to borrow under the global credit facility would be limited to a borrowing base that would be re determined semi annually 
funds borrowed under the global credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the global credit facility  forest and its restricted subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants and financial tests  including restrictions or requirements with respect to dividends  additional debt  liens  asset sales  investments  hedging activities  mergers and reporting responsibilities 
the global credit facility is secured by a lien on  and a security interest in  a portion of our proved oil and gas properties in the united states and canada  related assets  pledges of accounts receivable  and a pledge of of the capital stock of canadian forest and of the capital stock of forest pipeline company 
if forest s bank credit facility rating is downgraded  we may be obligated to pledge additional properties 
at december   the outstanding borrowings under the global credit facility were  in the united states and  in canada 
at march   the outstanding borrowings were  in the united states and  in canada  with an average effective interest rate of 
at march   forest had also used the global credit facility for letters of credit in the amount of  in the united states and  cdn in canada 
working capital 
forest had a working capital deficit of approximately  at december  compared to a working capital surplus of approximately  at december  the decrease in working capital is due primarily to an increase in payables related to exploration and development activities in the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period in  merger related payables outstanding at december  and a decrease in cash as a result of reduction of long term debt  offset partially by an increase in revenue related accounts receivable balances due to higher oil and gas prices at the end of periodically  forest reports working capital deficits at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits are principally the result of accounts payable for capitalized exploration and development costs 
settlement of these payables is funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by drawdowns on long term bank credit facilities 
for cash management purposes  drawdowns on the credit facilities are not made until the due dates of the payables 
cash flow 
historically  one of forest s primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in compared to  in the period included higher production revenue due to higher oil and gas prices and increased production due primarily to the merger with forcenergy 
we used  for investing activities in compared to  in the increase was due primarily to higher exploration and development expenditures in as a result of the merger with forcenergy 
cash used by financing activities in was  compared to  in the period included net repayments of bank debt of  offset partially by net proceeds of  from forcenergy s issuance of series a cumulative preferred stock 
the period included net proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes  net proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock  and  of cash acquired in the merger with forcenergy  offset by net repayments of bank borrowings of  net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in compared to  in the period included higher production revenue due to higher oil and gas prices and additional funds provided by net working capital changes 
we used  for investing activities in compared to  in cash used in the period was greater than cash used in the period due primarily to the acquisition of our onshore louisiana properties 
cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to  in the period included net proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes and net proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock  and  of cash at the date of fresh start of forcenergy  offset by net repayments of bank borrowings of  the period included net bank borrowings of  and net proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development for the past three years were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties    undeveloped properties    exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are approximately  we intend to meet our capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of non strategic assets and  if necessary  borrowings under existing lines of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient capital to meet these capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if we experience lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or other liquidity needs  or could be increased if we experience increased cash flow or access additional sources of capital 
in addition  while forest intends to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that we can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
dispositions of non strategic assets 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with little value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
at the present time  forest is offering for sale certain properties in each of our operating regions 
during  forest disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  also during  we disposed of gas processing facilities for net proceeds of  and disposed of a long term investment for net proceeds of  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of  recent accounting pronouncements 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
and no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we periodically hedge a portion of our oil and gas production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability in the volatile environment of oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
all of forest s energy swap and collar agreements and a portion of our basis swaps in place at december  have been designated as cash flow hedges 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january  we will record a liability of approximately  of which  will be classified as current and a deferred tax asset of approximately  of which  will be classified as current and a corresponding reduction in other comprehensive income of approximately in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
this opinion provides guidance on the accounting for certain stock option transactions and subsequent amendments to stock option transactions 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on forest s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
subsequently  the sec released sab b  which delayed the implementation date of sab for registrants with fiscal years beginning between december  and march  until the fourth quarter of the implementation of the provisions of sab did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of forest 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk forest is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk forest produces and sells natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids for its own account in the united states and canada and  through promark  its marketing subsidiary  markets natural gas for third parties in canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to manage commodity prices and to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  we enter into long term contracts and use a hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  forest enters into energy swaps  collars and other financial instruments 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
we use the hedge or deferral method of accounting for these activities and  as a result  gains and losses on the related instruments are generally offset by similar changes in the realized prices of the commodities 
promark also enters into trading activities on a limited basis in canada 
long term sales contracts 
a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool 
at december  the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf and approximately bcf of natural gas in at an average price of approximately cdn per mcf 
canadian forest  as one of the producers in the promark netback pool  is obligated to deliver a portion of this gas 
in canadian forest supplied approximately of the gas for the promark netback pool 
in addition to its commitments to the promark netback pool  canadian forest is committed to sell 
bcf of natural gas in at a fixed price of approximately cdn per mcf and 
bcf of natural gas in at a fixed price of approximately cdn per mcf 
hedging program 
in a typical swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
we enter into swap agreements when prices are less volatile or when collar arrangements are not attractively priced 
as of december   forest had the following swaps in place natural gas oil average average bbtu s hedged price barrels hedged price per day per mmbtu per day per bbl we also enter into collar agreements with third parties that are accounted for as hedges 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
collars are also settled in cash  either on a monthly basis or at the end of their terms 
by entering into collars we effectively provide a floor for the price that we will receive for the hedged production  however  the collar also establishes a maximum price that we will receive for the hedged production if prices increase above the ceiling price 
we enter into collars during periods of volatile commodity prices in order to protect against a significant decline in prices in exchange for forgoing the benefit of price increases in excess of the ceiling price on the hedged production 
as of december   we had the following collars in place natural gas average floor average ceiling price price per mmbtu per mmbtu bbtu s per day oil average floor average ceiling price price per bbl per bbl barrels per day we also use basis swaps in connection with natural gas swaps to fix the differential price between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is sold 
at december  there were basis swaps in place with weighted average volumes of  mmbtu s per day in forest periodically assesses the estimated portion of its anticipated production that is subject to hedging arrangements  and we adjust this percentage based on our assessment of market conditions and the availability of hedging arrangements which meet our criteria 
hedging arrangements covered  and of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
trading activities 
profits or losses generated by the purchase and sale of third parties gas are based on the spread between the prices of natural gas purchased and sold 
promark does not enter into agreements to buy or sell natural gas to hold as a speculative position 
all transactions are immediately offset  thereby fixing the margin 
at december   promark s trading operations had contracts to purchase an aggregate of bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf and had contracts to sell an aggregate of bcf of natural gas in at an average price of cdn per mcf 
foreign currency exchange risk forest conducts business in several foreign currencies and thus is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
canada 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of canadian forest 
as a result  canadian forest is exposed to foreign currency translation risk related to translation of the principal amount of the notes issued by it in late and early because these notes are denominated in us dollars 
the  principal amount of the debt is due in operations outside of north america 
the foreign concessions held by forest are in relatively early stages of exploratory activities 
expenditures incurred relative to these interests have been primarily us dollar denominated 
interest rate risk at the present time  forest has no financial instruments in place to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
therefore  our exposure to changes in interest rates results from short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
the following table presents principal or notional amounts and related average interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  thereafter total fair value dollar amounts in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate    average interest rate
