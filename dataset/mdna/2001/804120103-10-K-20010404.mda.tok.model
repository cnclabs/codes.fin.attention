sales of closeout footwear accounted for approximately of domestic saucony net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the originals footwear accounted for of fiscal domestic footwear unit volume versus in fiscal the unit volume decrease in originals footwear is primarily due to a lack of sell through on the new school products  which resulted in order cancellations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the order cancellation rate for our saucony footwear was higher than our historical average 
international net sales increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to a increase in technical footwear unit volumes and higher average wholesale per pair sell prices  partially offset by the negative impact of the stronger us dollar against european currencies 
footwear unit volumes at our international distributor business  and our european and canadian subsidiaries  increased and  respectively  in fiscal versus fiscal the footwear unit volume increase in our international distributor business is due primarily to our entry into the japanese footwear market in  which accounted for approximately of the international distributor unit volume increase

the average domestic wholesale selling price per pair of domestic footwear decreased in fiscal versus fiscal due to a higher proportion of more moderately priced originals and special make up footwear in our domestic product mix and lower average sell prices for technical footwear 
domestic net sales increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in domestic sales was due primarily to the continued strong demand for the originals footwear  which accounted for of domestic footwear unit volume for the year  and  to a lesser extent  increased special make up and technical footwear volume 
international net sales decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to the discontinuance of operations in australia and decreased distributor unit volume  partially offset by increased direct sales in canada and western europe due to increased unit volume 
other products segment net sales    the other products segment consists of our hind athletic apparel  ten factory outlet stores  spot bilt coaches and official shoes and casual walking and workplace footwear  hyde authentics casual footwear and sales from our former cycling division 
each of these businesses represented less than of total revenues and  in the aggregate  represented of total net sales in fiscal compared to worldwide sales of other products decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to the elimination of sales resulting from the cycling division divestiture  partially offset by increased sales of our hind brand apparel and increased sales at our factory outlet stores 
domestic net sales of other products decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due primarily to the elimination of sales from our former cycling division  which was divested in fiscal  partially offset by increased unit volume of our hind apparel brand and increased sales at our factory outlet division stores due to the net addition of two factory outlet stores

international net sales of other products decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to the discontinuance of operations in australia 
costs and expenses our gross margin in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal  due primarily to a change in domestic saucony product mix to higher levels of closeout sales at comparatively lower margins  domestic pricing pressures  increased inventory reserves and  to a lesser extent  the negative impact of the stronger us dollar on our european margins and a change in the saucony international sales mix to increased distributor sales 
for the fiscal year  the gross margin improved to from in fiscal the improvement in the fiscal margin was due to a change in product mix  purchasing economies  lower levels of product returns and markdowns and lower levels of closeout product sales

sale of cycling division on june   we sold substantially all of the assets and business of our cycling division  consisting of inventory  prepaid expenses  equipment and tradenames  to qr merlin acquisition llc for  in cash and the assumption of in liabilities 
in connection with the sale  we recorded a pre tax loss of  inclusive of  of expenses associated with the transaction and expenses resulting from our exit of the cycling business  or  after tax or per diluted share 
as a result of the transaction  a majority of the cycling division employees were severed and assets used exclusively in the cycling business were deemed impaired and have been written off 
expenses associated with the sale and exit of the cycling division are as follows transaction costs costs to exit facility and equipment leases and other non cancelable contractual commitments employee severance and termination benefits writeoff leasehold improvements writeoff goodwill and other deferred charges total  included in accrued expenses at january  are of costs associated with the sale and the exit of the cycling business  which we expect will be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal net sales from the cycling division  which are included in our other products segment  represented approximately  and of consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the loss on the sale of the cycling division is included in the income before tax for the other products segment 
interest expense net interest expense totaled  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest expense decreased in fiscal due to lower average debt levels and increased interest income  partially offset by higher interest rates on our domestic borrowings 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased due to lower average debt levels and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates compared to fiscal income before taxes segment saucony    other products   consolidated    we evaluate business performance and the performance of key managers based on profit or loss before income taxes 
income before tax decreased by  in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal  due primarily to the loss on the sale of the cycling division  which impacted the other products segment  and lower domestic pre tax income realized by the domestic saucony segment due to lower gross margins and higher selling expenses  partially offset by improved profitability in our saucony international and hind apparel businesses 
income before tax improved by  in fiscal to  compared to  in fiscal  due primarily to the significant increase in pre tax income realized by the domestic saucony segment and profitable saucony international operations 
the other products segment recorded a pre tax loss of  in fiscal compared to a loss of in fiscal the deterioration in the other products segment pre tax income in fiscal was due principally to the diminished financial position of quintana roo  due in large part to excess inventories and a high level of administrative overhead 
income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to the loss on the sale of the cycling division which reduced domestic pre tax income 
the effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a shift in the composition of domestic and foreign pre tax earnings and an increase in deferred valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards that are not expected to be realized 
the provision for income taxes increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in domestic pre tax income and a higher marginal domestic tax rate in fiscal the effective tax rate increased by to in fiscal from in fiscal due to a shift in the composition of domestic and foreign pre tax earnings and the higher marginal domestic tax rate 
net income net income for fiscal decreased to  or per diluted share  compared to  or per diluted share  in fiscal the loss on the sale of our cycling division reduced net income and diluted earnings per share by  and  respectively  in fiscal excluding the effect of the loss on the sale of our cycling division  our net income in fiscal would have been  or per diluted share 
weighted average common shares and equivalent shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal net income was  compared to  in fiscal diluted earnings per share was in fiscal compared to per diluted share in fiscal weighted average common shares and equivalent shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively  in fiscal and liquidity and capital resources fiscal as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from december  the increase was due primarily to the generation of  of cash from operations  the receipt of  from the sale of our former cycling division and an increase of in short term borrowings  principally under our credit facilities 
this increase was partially offset by cash outlays for capital assets of  the repurchase of shares of our common stock of  and the repayment of long term debt of the increase in accounts receivable of  net of the provision for bad debt and discounts  was due primarily to increased net sales of our saucony and other products in the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable 
our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable increased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal  due primarily to the reserve of  provided for on the receivable due from just for feet  inc in fiscal  which reduced the fiscal days sales outstanding by days  and  to a lesser extent  the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories increased  in fiscal due to increased domestic saucony footwear inventory  increased hind apparel inventory and increased inventory at the our factory outlet stores  due to the net addition of two stores in the increase in domestic saucony footwear inventory resulted from increased order cancellations in the fourth quarter of for both technical and originals footwear 
we expect that the majority of the inventory increase that resulted from the fourth quarter order cancellations will be sold in the first six months of fiscal  though we expect that a portion of this inventory will be sold at lower than customary margins 
our inventory turns ratio decreased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal the number of day s sales in inventory remained constant at days for both fiscal and fiscal principal factors other than net income  accounts receivable  provision for bad debts and discounts and inventory affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal included an increase of  in accrued letters of credit due to increased direct ship inventory purchases  a decrease of  in accrued expenses due to decreased performance based compensation accruals and the payment of expenses resulting from the cycling division divestiture  a decrease of in accounts payables due to the timing of inventory purchases and a decrease of in income taxes payable due to domestic tax payments made in the fourth quarter of 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock for a total expenditure of  of which was financed with borrowed funds 
at january   this borrowing and accrued interest thereon of are included in notes payable 
since the approval of the stock buyback program by the board of directors in may  we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for a total of expenditure of  as of january   we are authorized to repurchase an additional  shares under the stock buyback program 
our ability to repurchase additional shares of common stock  however  is restricted to a maximum of  from november  to december   under our credit facility with our primary lender 
as of january   however  no repurchases are permitted under the credit facility 
fiscal as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  a decrease of  from january  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease of  in borrowings against our credit facilities  the repayment of of long term debt  the repurchase of shares of our common stock of and  of cash expended to acquire capital assets 
offsetting this cash outflow was the generation of  of cash from operations and the receipt of from the issuance of shares of our common stock 
the increase in accounts receivable of  net of the provision for bad debt and discounts including a reserve of  provided for on the receivable due from just for feet  inc  was due primarily to increased net sales of our saucony products in the fourth quarter of fiscal our days sales outstanding for our accounts receivable decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal due to a reduction in domestic terms offered on sales of originals footwear and the reserve provided for on the receivable due from just for feet  inc inventories increased  in fiscal due to increased domestic and international saucony footwear inventory and increased inventory at our factory outlet stores  reflecting the addition of two stores in our inventory turns ratio increased to turns in fiscal from turns in fiscal the number of days sales in inventory decreased to days in fiscal from days in fiscal principal factors other than net income  accounts receivable  provision for bad debts and discounts and inventory affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal included an increase of in accrued letters of credit due to increased in transit inventory  an increase of  in accrued expenses due to increased performance based compensation accruals  increased accruals for advertising and promotional expenses and increased levels of administrative spending  a decrease of  in accounts payables due to the timing of inventory purchases and a decrease of in income taxes payable due to domestic tax payments made in the fourth quarter of credit facility we maintain a revolving credit line of  for cash borrowings and letters of credit 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are not collateralized 
the credit facility contains certain restrictions and financial covenants with which we are required to comply  whether or not there are any borrowings outstanding 
under the most restrictive covenant  we were required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  as of january  the credit facility is also subject to the bank s periodic review of our operations 
our ability to declare or pay dividends and repurchase shares of common stock is restricted under the credit facility 
from november  to december   we were authorized under the credit facility to repurchase up to  in shares of common stock 
as of january  and march    and  respectively  were available for borrowing under the credit facility 
several of our foreign subsidiaries maintain credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  at march  an aggregate of approximately  was available for borrowing under the facilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures commitments at january   our commitments for capital expenditures were not material 
overall liquidity our liquidity is contingent upon a number of factors  principally our future operating results 
management believes that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and internally generated funds are adequate to meet our working capital requirements and to fund our capital investment needs and debt service payments 
inflation and currency risk the effect of inflation on our results of operations over the past three years has been minimal 
the impact of currency fluctuation on our purchase of inventory from foreign suppliers has been minimal as the transactions were denominated in us dollars 
we are  however  subject to currency fluctuation risk with respect to the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries and certain foreign currency denominated payables 
during fiscal the gross margins of our european subsidiaries were negatively impacted due to currency fluctuation 
we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to minimize certain transaction currency risks 
we believe that our forward foreign currency contracts function as economic hedges of our cash flows and that our foreign exchange management program effectively minimizes certain transaction currency risks 
accounting pronouncements sfas and sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 a deferral of the effective date of sfas sfas  which is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years commencing after june   with early adoption permitted 
sfas defines the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities 
upon adoption of sfas  all derivatives must be recognized on the balance sheet at their then fair value and any deferred gains or losses remaining on the balance sheet under previous hedge accounting rules must be removed from the balance sheet 
in the period of adoption  the transition adjustments may affect current earnings and other comprehensive income 
sfas requires companies to recognize adjustments to the fair value of derivatives that are not hedges currently in earnings when they occur 
for derivatives that qualify as hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives can be recognized currently in earnings  along with an offsetting adjustment against the basis of the underlying hedged item  or can be deferred in other comprehensive income  depending on the currency exposure of the underlying transaction 
our forward currency contracts qualified for hedge accounting under generally accepted accounting principles prior to sfas  however  upon adoption of sfas we have not designated these contracts as qualifying for hedge accounting as defined by sfas we believe that these contracts economically function as effective hedges of the underlying exposures  but  due to the short term nature of the contracts  we have not elected to designate these contracts as hedges for accounting purposes 
we adopted sfas on january  as a result  we recorded an approximately increase in the fair value of our derivatives as a cumulative effect of an accounting change on accumulated other comprehensive income 
these amounts will be recognized in earnings when the underlying transactions are recorded 
staff accounting bulletin no

in march and june the sec issued staff accounting bulletins no 
a and no 
b  respectively  to delay the implementation date of sab until the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal the initial application of sab did not have a material effect on earnings or on our financial position in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
special note regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we disclaim any duty to update any forward looking statements  all of which are expressly qualified by the statement in this section 
certain other factors that may affect future results we face intense competition competition is intense in the markets in which we sell our products 
we compete with a large number of other companies  both domestic and foreign  several of which have diversified product lines  well known brands and financial  distribution and marketing resources substantially greater than ours 
the principal competitors for our saucony products are nike  new balance and asics 
the principal competitors of our hind products are nike  pearl izumi and tyr 
we compete based on a variety of factors  including price  quality  product design  brand image  marketing and promotion and ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers 
a technological breakthrough or marketing or promotional success by one of our competitors could adversely affect our competitive position 
the intensity of the competition that we face constitutes a significant risk to our business 
we depend on foreign suppliers a number of manufacturers located in asia  primarily in china  supply products and product components to us 
during fiscal  one of our suppliers  located in china  accounted for approximately of our total footwear purchases by dollar volume 
we are subject to the usual risks of a business involving foreign suppliers  such as currency fluctuations  government regulation of fund transfers  export and import duties  administrative trade cases  trade limitations imposed by the united states or foreign governments and political and labor instability 
there are a number of trade related and other issues creating significant friction between the governments of the united states and china  and the imposition of punitive import duties on certain categories of chinese products has been threatened in the past and may be implemented in the future 
in addition  we have no long term manufacturing agreements with our foreign suppliers and compete with other athletic shoe and apparel companies  including companies that are much larger than us  for access to production facilities 
we need to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and merchandise trends the footwear and apparel industries are subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
demand for our products  particularly our originals line  may be adversely affected by changing fashion trends and consumer style preferences 
we believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner 
in addition  our decisions concerning new product designs often need to be made several months before we can determine consumer acceptance 
as a result  our failure to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles or features could lead to problems such as excess inventories and higher markdowns  lower gross margins due to the necessity of providing discounts to retailers and the inability to sell such products through our own factory outlet stores 
our quarterly results may fluctuate our revenues and quarterly operating results may vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including o the timing and shipment of individual orders  o market acceptance of footwear and other products offered by us  o changes in our operating expenses  o personnel changes  o mix of products sold  o changes in product pricing  o general economic conditions  and  o weather 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is realized during the last few weeks of each quarter 
as a result  any delays in orders or shipments are more likely to result in revenue not being recognized until the following quarter  which could adversely impact our results of operations for a particular quarter 
our current expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenue 
as a result  net income for a given period could be disproportionately affected by any reduction in revenue 
it is possible that in some future quarter our revenue or operating results will be below the expectations of stock market securities analysts and investors 
if that were to occur  the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
our revenues are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations we conduct operations in various international countries  and a portion of our sales is transacted in local currencies 
as a result  our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  our financial results have been adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to protect us from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates 
however  our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful  and currency exchange rates may have an adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns the footwear and apparel industries are generally characterized by significant seasonality of sales and results of operations 
sales of our saucony brand products have historically been seasonal in nature  with the strongest sales generally occurring in the first and third quarters 
in addition  sales of our hind brand products are generally strongest in the third and fourth quarters due to the popularity of the hind winter apparel collection 
we believe that sales of our products will continue to follow this seasonal cycle 
therefore  our results of operations for any one quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
our operating results may be affected by order cancellations customers may cancel orders of our products at any time without financial penalty 
as a result  our backlog does not necessarily represent actual future shipments 
the rate of customer cancellations can vary quarter to quarter and year to year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the order cancellation rate for our saucony footwear was higher than our historical average  due primarily to the weak retail environment and higher than anticipated cancellations and the postponement of shipments of orders by one of our major retail accounts 
if the retail market continues to be weak or weakens again in the future  our customers could cancel further orders of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are susceptible to financial difficulties of retailers we sell our products primarily to major retailers  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
we cannot predict what effect the future financial condition of such retailers will have on our business 
in particular  we cannot guarantee that our bad debt expenses will not be material in future periods 
we need effective marketing and advertising programs because consumer demand for our products is heavily influenced by brand image  our business requires substantial investments in marketing and advertising 
failure of such investments to achieve the desired effect in terms of increased retailer acceptance or consumer purchase of our products could adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  we believe that our success depends in part upon our ability to periodically launch new marketing and advertising programs 
if we are unable to successfully design or execute new marketing and advertising  or if such programs are ineffective  our business will suffer 
we depend on certain key customers during  we derived approximately of our consolidated revenue from sales to a single major customer  venator  which operates foot locker  lady foot locker  kids foot locker  champs and eastbay running stores 
we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will depend to a significant extent upon sales to major customers 
the loss of or a reduction in the level of sales to one or more major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if a major customer were unable or unwilling to proceed with a large order or to pay us for a large order on a timely basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business our business is sensitive to consumers spending patterns  which in turn are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions  such as interest and taxation rates  employment levels and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these economic factors may restrict consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting our growth and profitability 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates and foreign currency rate changes is to limit the impact of these changes on cash flows and earnings and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
in order to achieve these objectives we identify the risks and manage them by adjusting fixed and variable rate debt positions and selectively hedging foreign currency risks 
almost all of our borrowings are based on floating rates  which would increase interest expense in an environment of rising interest rates 
we have a policy of selectively hedging foreign currency risks  but there are no assurances that this program will fully insulate us against short term fluctuations in financial results 
the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of january  was  we have calculated the effect of a change in interest rates over a one month period from january  and also a change in certain foreign currency rates over the same period and determined the effects to be immaterial 
we do not expect to make any significant changes in our management of foreign currency or interest rate exposures or in the strategies we employ to manage such exposures in the foreseeable future 
however  our accounting for derivative transactions will be affected by our adoption of sfas on january
