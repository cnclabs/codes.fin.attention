on september   the company entered into a new five year credit agreement the agreement with a bank group headed by the chase manhattan bank as administrative agent and the first national bank of chicago as documentation agent 
the bank group has a total of domestic banks and international banks 
the agreement provides the company with a  borrowing facility 
the new agreement replaces the previously existing revolving credit agreement with nbd bank  na under this agreement  the company has pledged of the common stock of the company s foreign subsidiaries as collateral 
the agreement permits the company to choose between various interest rate options 
under the agreement  the interest rate options available to the company are a us prime rate or dollars in thousands  except share data b libor plus the applicable margin ranging from 
to 
or c competitive bid at a libor rate borrowing or a fixed rate borrowing to be determined by auction 
the applicable margin is adjusted based upon the funded indebtedness to cash flow ratio of the company 
additionally  the company pays a commitment fee of between 
to 
on the entire portion of the agreement 
on september   the company utilized  of the agreement in order to repay the then outstanding balance under the previously existing revolving credit agreement 
on september   the company borrowed  to finance the acquisition of the outstanding common stock of biowhittaker 
of this amount   was utilized on september  to acquire the of biowhittaker shares which had been tendered at that date 
the company subsequently utilized the remaining portion to finance the acquisition of the remaining of biowhittaker on october  the undrawn borrowing availability under the agreement as of december  and was  and  respectively 
there is  outstanding as of december  management is of the opinion that these amounts  together with cash flows from operations  are adequate for meeting the company s operating  financing and capital requirements 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro currency  and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the net notional amount of these contracts at december   excluding  of inter company contracts  was  which the company estimates to be approximately of the non local currency exposure during the period 
unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
given the unlikely scenario that the operating companies non local currency collections match their forecast  and that all collections move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on a non hedged risk of  this residual risk allows for an over forecasting margin of error and prevents over hedging of actual operating risk 
as of december   the combined non local currency forecasted net collections amounted to  offsetting this exposure are the expected  us dollar inter company payments from the combined european sites 
the remaining  forecasted exposure was partially hedged  with major banks to reduce the non hedged risk to  interest rate management the company s interest paid to support the debt increased over the past year due primarily to higher rates 
each of the interest rate options in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining market 
however  it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
for example  based on the company s current net debt outstanding  an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and thus dollars in thousands  except share data decrease the company s after tax profitability by after tax 
fortunately  movement in interest rates is a risk that can be controlled 
the company has employed a plan to control interest rate risk 
to limit the risk of interest rates rising above a tolerable level  the company would pay a premium now in order to obtain a fixed interest rate at a predetermined cost in the future 
that premium  or swap  stabilizes interest costs by converting floating or variable rates to fixed rates through a contract with a financial institution 
we monitor the company s debt position and market trends to protect it from any unforeseen shifts in interest rates 
as of december   the company had eight interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average rate of  and with varying maturity dates through the year the company s strategy has been to cover approximately of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company is a party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the company had accruals  included in current accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities  of  and  at december  and  respectively  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and the company s current and former operating sites for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents management s best estimate of what it believes are the reasonably possible environmental cleanup related costs of a non capital nature 
during the past three year period  cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters were  and  for  and  respectively 
there were no provisions for environmental contingencies during the past three year period 
the company reduced reserves by approximately  and  during the third quarters of and  respectively  as a result of revised estimates 
in addition  the company settled certain environmental claims involving the cosan chemical corporation a subsidiary with insurance companies for  in and  in after reviewing information currently available  management believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from the estimates could have a material adverse effect on financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
litigation the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl profarmaco were named as defendants in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc on december   in the united states district court for the district of columbia 
the complaint alleges that exclusive license agreements which profarmaco entered into with mylan laboratories  inc mylan covering the drug master files for and therefore the right to buy and use two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis  lorazepam and clorazepate  were part of an effort on mylan s part to restrict competition in the supply of lorazepam and clorazepate and to increase the price charged for these products when mylan sold them as generic pharmaceuticals 
the complaint further alleges that these agreements violate the federal trade commission act  and that mylan  cambrex  profarmaco  and gyma laboratories of america  inc  profarmaco s distributor in the united states  engaged in an unlawful restraint of trade and conspired to monopolize and attempted to monopolize the markets for the generic pharmaceuticals incorporating the apis 
in accordance with the license agreement  the company received royalties of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a lawsuit making similar allegations against the company and profarmaco  and seeking injunctive relief and treble damages  has been filed by the attorneys general of dollars in thousands  except share data states in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of those states and persons in those states who were purchasers of the generic pharmaceuticals 
the company and profarmaco have also been named in purported class action complaints brought by private plaintiffs in various state courts on behalf of purchasers of lorazepam and clorazepate in generic form  making allegations essentially similar to those raised in the ftc s complaint and seeking various forms of relief including treble damages 
on february   a federal court in washington  dc entered an order and stipulated permanent injunction as part of a settlement of the ftc and attorneys general s suits 
under these settlement documents mylan has agreed to pay over million on its own behalf and on behalf of most of the other defendant companies including cambrex and profarmaco 
in the order and injunction  the settling defendants also agreed to monitor certain future conduct 
the company strongly believes that its licensing arrangements with mylan are in accordance with regulatory requirements and will vigorously defend the various other lawsuits and class actions 
however  the company and mylan have terminated the exclusive license to the drug master files as of december  in entering these licensing arrangements  the company elected not to raise the price of its products and had no control or influence over the pricing of its final generic product 
some private litigation will continue 
until recently  mylan had been fully covering the costs for the defense and indemnity of cambrex and profarmaco under certain obligations set forth in the license agreements 
cambrex has now agreed to cover separate legal defense costs incurred for cambrex and profarmaco on a going forward basis beginning august  these costs are not expected to be significant 
on may   the company s nepera subsidiary  a manufacturer and seller of niacinamide vitamin b  received a federal grand jury subpoena for the production of documents relating to the pricing and possible customer allocation with regard to that product 
the company understands that the subpoena was issued as part of the federal government s ongoing anti trust investigation into various business practices in the vitamin industry generally 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reached a settlement with the government concerning nepera s alleged role in vitamin b violations from to on october   the government settlement was finalized with nepera entering into a voluntary plea agreement with the department of justice 
under this agreement  nepera has entered a plea of guilty to one count of price fixing and market allocation of vitamin b from to in violation of section one of the sherman act and has agreed to pay a fine of  nepera will be on probation for one year 
the fine  for which we are fully reserved  was paid in february nepera has been named as a defendant  along with several other companies  in a number of private civil actions brought on behalf of alleged purchasers of vitamin b an accrual of  was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the anticipated government settlement  related litigation  and legal expenses 
the balance of this accrual as of december  was  this accrual has been recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the above litigation matters and various other lawsuits  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
these matters  if resolved in an unfavorable manner  could have a material effect on the operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period
