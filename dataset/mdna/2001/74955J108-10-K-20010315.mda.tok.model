funds from operations and ebitda the company considers funds from operations ffo and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to be appropriate measures of a reit s performance which should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap which includes all operating results of the company  both recurring and non recurring  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciable operating property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash flows from operations as determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions

for the year ended december   cash flow provided by operating activities was million the company believes that its cash provided by operating activities will be adequate to meet some of its liquidity needs 
the company currently expects to fund its strategic objectives and any other liquidity needs by borrowing on its line of credit  exchanging equity for hotel properties or possibly accessing the capital markets if market conditions permit 
at december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and had borrowed million under its million line of credit

the company increased the availability under its line of credit from million to million during the year 
the increased line of credit matures on july  the interest rate remained substantially unchanged ranging from basis points to basis points above libor  depending on the company s ratio of total debt to its investment in hotel properties as defined 
the interest rate was approximately at december  the line of credit is collateralized by the collateral pool 
the company can obtain a release of the pledge of any hotel in the collateral pool if the company provides a substitute hotel or reduces the total availability under the line of credit 
the line of credit contains various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum net worth  minimum debt and interest coverage ratios  and total indebtedness and liability limitations 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  on august   the company completed a million long term financing  the financing is collateralized by a lien on eight of the company s hotel properties  carries a fixed interest rate of  has a year amortization and matures in years 
the financing allowed the company to a extend its debt maturities over a longer term and b increase the percentage of fixed interest rate debt 
the proceeds were utilized to reduce borrowings outstanding under the company s line of credit 
on november   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million maturing in july the agreement effectively converts a portion of the company s floating rate debt to fixed rate in order to reduce the company s risk to increases in interest rates 
such agreements involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payments over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
accordingly  the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on these interest rate swap agreements is fully offset by the opposite impact on the related debt 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the company receives payments based on the one month libor rate of at december  and pays a fixed rate of 
the company s other borrowings are nonrecourse to the company and contain provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral  upon satisfaction of certain conditions  after the respective loans have been outstanding for approximately four years 
most of the mortgage borrowings are repayable and subject to various prepayment penalties  yield maintenance  or defeasance obligations 
on january   the company issued thousand shares of non convertible mandatorily redeemable series b preferred stock for million prior to fees and expenses of approximately million 
holders of the series b preferred stock are entitled to receive quarterly cash dividends commencing march  at an annual rate of 
beginning january   the dividend rate increases per annum up to a maximum rate of 
the company may redeem shares of the series b preferred stock in whole but not in part  on or after december  at the original price of million 
if the shares are redeemed before december   the redemption price is at varying premiums over the original share price 
the shares are mandatorily redeemable by the holders at varying amounts over the original share price  depending on when the shares are redeemed  upon a change of control  dissolution or winding up of the company or on the company s failure to qualify as a reit 
future scheduled principal payments of debt obligations at december  are as follows in thousands amount thereafter  certain significant credit statistics at december  are as follows trailing twelve month interest coverage ratio of x total debt to ebitda of x weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt of years fixed interest rate debt equal to of total debt debt equal to of investment in hotel properties  at cost before depreciation and after capital expenditures during  the company spent on capital improvements to its hotels 
the company expects to spend approximately million on capital improvements to its hotels in which the operating partnership is expected to fund from cash generated from operations and borrowings under the line of credit 
the company in the future may seek to increase further the amount of its credit facilities  negotiate additional credit facilities  or issue corporate debt instruments 
although the company has no charter restrictions on the amount of indebtedness the company may incur  the board of directors of the company has adopted a current policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that the company will incur to an amount not in excess of approximately of the company s investment in hotel properties  at cost  as defined 
the board of directors may change the debt policy at any time without shareholder approval 
the company intends to fund cash distributions to shareholders principally out of cash generated from operations 
the company may incur  or cause the operating partnership to incur  indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code including the requirement that a reit distribute to its shareholders annually at least of its taxable income effective january  to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the company s investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
the company believes that it maintains a conservative dividend policy 
based on results the company s dividend payout ratio was dividends divided by funds from operations and the dividend coverage ratio was x funds from operations divided by dividends 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of the lessees and management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the hotels operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher occupancy during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating profits 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which provides guidance on revenue recognition 
sab is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sab requires that a lessor not recognize contingent rental income until annual specified hurdles have been achieved by the lessee 
during and prior years  the company recognized contingent rentals throughout the year since it was considered probable that the lessee would exceed the annual specified hurdles 
the company has reviewed the terms of its percentage leases and has determined that the provisions of sab materially impact the company s revenue recognition on an interim basis in effectively deferring the recognition of revenue from its percentage leases from the first and second quarters of the calendar year to the third and fourth quarters 
sab will not impact the company s revenue recognition on an annual basis given that company has only calendar year leases 
sab will have no impact on the company s interim or annual cash flow from its lessees  and therefore on its ability to pay dividends 
the company has accounted for sab as a change in accounting principle effective january  in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
was originally effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after september  sfas no 
deferred the effective date of sfas no 
to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption on january   the company will record a liability of approximately million representing the estimated value of the swap with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income 
the company will record subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap through other comprehensive income 
these instruments are designated as hedges

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  one being fluctuations in interest rates 
the company monitors interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as occupancy 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing under our line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately thousand  based on balances outstanding during the year ending december  the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rate as a result of its line of credit and long term debt 
at december   the company had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million 
the company s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
approximately of the company s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of at december  on november   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of million which effectively locked an interest rate before the spread over libor of through an interest rate swap agreement 
the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the following table provides information about the company s instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations outstanding at december   the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  for the interest rate swap  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having similar debt service requirements  which could have been borrowed by the company at december  the rate assumed in the fair value calculation of fixed rate debt is equal to which consists of the year treasury of as december  plus basis points 
expected principal cash flows fair value liabilities thereafter total total in thousands long term debt fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate     average interest rate interest rate derivatives variable to fixed   average receive rate average pay rate the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  and does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
in addition  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  prevailing interest rates  and the company s strategies at that time 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s financing requirements
