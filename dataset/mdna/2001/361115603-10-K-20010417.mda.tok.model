at january  compared to 
at december  our total assets at january  aggregated million compared to million at december  our restaurants are a cash business 
funds available from cash sales are not needed to finance receivables and are not generally needed immediately to pay for food  supplies and certain other expenses of the restaurants 
therefore  our business and operations have not historically required proportionately large amounts of working capital  which is generally common among similar restaurant companies 
should dynamic foods expand its sales to third parties  the accounts receivable and inventory related to such sales could require us to maintain additional working capital 
on april   we entered into a new million revolving credit and term loan agreement credit agreement with various banks and lenders 
concurrent with the execution of this new agreement we defeased and gave notice of redemption of our senior secured notes due december  and repaid in full the million of notes due december  accordingly  the balance of these notes  less the current portion of the new term loan  has been classified as long term at january  after the redemption of the notes and the notes  we had million outstanding under the new credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains covenants with regard to maintaining certain leverage ratios  achieving certain levels of ebitda  operating cash flow and limits on capital expenditures 
in addition there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and additional indebtedness 
the credit agreement allows us to borrow at either a federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or at a eurocurrency reserve rate plus an applicable margin 
the credit agreement provides that we can borrow up to million on a revolving basis until april   of which million was drawn at closing  with the remaining million of available borrowings to be used for working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement contains a million term loan a and a million term loan b 
the term loan a and term loan b provide for quarterly amortization through april  and april   respectively  with the remaining amounts outstanding then due 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a security interest in and liens upon substantially all of our assets 
as a result of defeasing the senior secured notes  we have been legally released as obligors and will report an extraordinary pre tax gain of approximately million in the second quarter of during the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   furr s expended million  million and million  respectively  principally to maintain and remodel existing cafeterias  upgrade its computer and information systems  construct four new units  relocate one unit and improve the facility operated by dynamic foods 
the capital expenditures in and were primarily due to a significant reimaging program 
in  we spent million to complete the reimage program total of restaurants reimaged and million to construct three new units and relocate one unit 
the remaining units that were not selected for reimaging were determined to either not need updating or would not yield a sufficient return on the investment 
with our reimaging program complete  we expect expenditures to be million  principally for routine maintenance of our units  corporate facilities  and dynamic foods 
our capital expenditure program is necessary to enable us and our subsidiaries to increase our revenue and profitability 
from time to time  we consider whether disposition of certain of our assets  including our food processing and distribution operations  real estate owned in fee simple and leasehold interests or potential acquisitions of assets would be beneficial or appropriate for our long term goals and in order to increase stockholder value 
in furr s settled litigation and an irs audit involving our pension plan 
the cash impact of the settlement on furr s includes payment in of million of expenses for legal and professional fees  with the remainder of the settlement to be paid to the plan in future years to fund increased benefit payments to former and current employees 
the settlement did not require any funding payments to the plan by furr s in but is expected to require payments by furr s to the plan of approximately million in and approximately thousand in  with additional funding payments required in subsequent years in amounts that are expected to decline over time  subject to the overall funding status of the plan 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
we purchase certain commodities used in food preparation 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature 
our long term debt does not expose us to market risk as all interest accrues at fixed rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage overall borrowing costs 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets
