the agreement with storagetek was an oem  licensing and distribution agreement that gave storagetek the right to integrate the company s software products with storagetek equipment

the number of days sales outstanding dso at january  was days  an increase of days from january  management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at january  is adequate 
as of january   the company s balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
the company believes that its current balance of cash  cash equivalents and its funds generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund the company s current projected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
prior to fiscal year  the company had primarily used cash provided by sales of its common stock to finance its operations 
if the actions taken by management are not effective in achieving profitable operating results  the company may be required to pursue additional external sources of financing in the future to support its operations and capital requirements 
there can be no assurances that external sources of financing will be available if required  or that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
as of january   the company had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million 
the company incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended january  the accumulated deficit of the company at january  was million 
the realization of the benefits of the nols is dependent on sufficient taxable income in future fiscal years 
lack of future earnings  or a change in the ownership of the company  could adversely affect the company s ability to utilize the nols 
despite the nol carryforwards  the company may have income tax liability in future years due to the application of the alternative minimum tax rules of the internal revenue code 
further  the nols generated prior to the combination are subject to the annual limitations prescribed by irc section factors that may affect future results forward looking information the company s business environment is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  changes in customer requirements and emerging new market segments 
consequently  to compete effectively  the company must make frequent new product introductions and enhancements while protecting its intellectual property  retain its key personnel and deploy sales and marketing resources to take advantage of new business opportunities 
future operating results will be affected by the ability of the company to expand its product distribution channels and to manage the expected growth of the company 
future results may also be impacted by the effectiveness of the company in executing future acquisitions and integrating the operations of acquired companies with those of the company 
failure to meet any of these challenges could adversely affect future operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  the company s period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the timing of the closing of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of the company s products can require a significant investment from a potential customer which the customer generally views as a discretionary cost that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons and can involve long sales cycles of six months or more 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because the company ships its products soon after an order is received and  as such does not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license fee revenues are heavily dependent upon a limited number of orders for large licenses received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  the company has generally recorded a significant portion of its total quarterly license fee revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues occurring in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company expects these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
despite the uncertainties in its revenue patterns  the company s operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout a quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are deferred or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of its operations to date 
euro conversion on january   the exchange rates of eleven countries germany  france  the netherlands  austria  italy  spain  finland  ireland  belgium  portugal and luxembourg were fixed amongst one another and became the currencies of the euro 
the currencies of the eleven countries will remain in circulation until mid the euro currency will be introduced on january  the company does not expect future balance sheets and statements of earnings and cash flows to be materially impacted by the euro conversion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally confined to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse effects of differing tax structures 
international revenues from ctil  the company s foreign sales subsidiary located in the united kingdom  along with entities established in paris  france and munich  germany  were approximately of total revenues in fiscal year international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign subsidiary and are typically denominated in british pounds  french francs or german deutsche marks 
as of january   approximately  and of total consolidated accounts receivable were denominated in british pounds  french francs and german deutsche marks  respectively 
additionally  the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which royalties on ctil sales are charged to ctil and recorded as intercompany receivables on the books of the us parent company 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of ctil are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
as of january   of the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was included in the company s foreign subsidiaries 
cash equivalents consist of funds deposited in money market accounts with original maturities of three months or less 
the company s short term investments consist primarily of us government treasury bills  with maturity dates ranging from months to months 
given the relatively short maturity periods of cash equivalents and short term investments  the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited
