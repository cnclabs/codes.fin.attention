item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
since our inception in  we have primarily devoted our resources to funding drug discovery research and development 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through o private placements of common stock  which raised an aggregate of million in net proceeds  o our initial public offering  which raised an aggregate of million in net proceeds including the over allotment sold in january o a private placement of preferred stock on march   which raised approximately million in net proceeds  and  o subsequent public offerings  one of which closed during october and raised approximately million and one of which closed during april and raised approximately million in net proceeds  and o exercise of public warrants for an aggregate of approximately million in net proceeds through january  on july   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of immunopharmaceutics in exchange for  shares of our common stock  and later issued an additional  shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of certain research milestones 
immunopharmaceutics financial results have been included in our financial statements since august  in march  immunopharmaceutics remaining operations in california were consolidated into our houston operations 
during october  we signed a research and common stock purchase agreement with lg chemical 
lg chemical purchased  shares of our common stock for million and committed to pay us up to million over a five year period to develop two compounds in clinical development 
of this amount  million has been paid and million will be paid on june and december  we assigned one half of the remaining research payments to icos tbc in conjunction with the icos tbc agreement in august  we entered into an agreement with gsk whereby we granted gsk the exclusive right to work with us in the development and commercialization of argatroban in the us and canada for specified indications 
upon execution of the agreement  gsk paid an million license fee  a million milestone payment in october  a million milestone payment in june and has also committed to pay up to a total of million in additional milestone payments based on the clinical development and fda approval of argatroban for the indications of hit and acute myocardial infarction 
future milestone payments for the acute myocardial infarction indication are subject to gsk s agreement to market argatroban for the acute myocardial infarction indication 
at this time  gsk has no plans to conduct development work for the acute myocardial infarction and stroke indications 
we are currently conducting a clinical trial for the use of evaluating the feasibility of developing argatroban for ischemic stroke and considering evaluating other indications 
in connection with the agreement  gsk purchased  shares of our common stock for million and an additional  shares of our common stock for million in conjunction with our public offering  which closed during october on june   we and icos entered into the icos tbc limited partnership agreement 
the partnership will seek to develop and globally commercialize et a receptor antagonists 
as a result of our contribution of technology  icos tbc paid a license fee to us in june  and will make additional milestone payments to us that together could be as much as million for the development and commercialization of products resulting from the collaboration 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this transaction 
on june   we and schering plough entered into a worldwide research collaboration and license agreement to discover  develop and commercialize vla antagonists 
in addition to research costs  schering plough paid an upfront license fee and is committed to make future milestone payments and royalty payments on product sales resulting from the agreement 
total payments to us for the programs included in the agreement  excluding royalties  could be as much as million 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this transaction 
in september  we founded revotar biopharmaceuticals  ag  a german corporation  and transferred to revotar certain development and commercialization rights to our selectin antagonist program as well as rights to other proprietary technology 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this transaction 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
results of operations revenues were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  revenues included million  million and million respectively from research agreements  commercialization agreements and collaborations with various other companies 
in mid november   gsk began the sale of argatroban  for which the company received royalties of  net of commissions 
because the fda first approved argatroban in june  there were no comparable sales or royalties in the prior years 
the company implemented on october   effective january   staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  promulgated by the united states securities and exchange commission sec in december pursuant to the requirements of sab  receipts of license fees and milestone payments  which in prior years had been recognized upon receipt  are now recognized as revenues over the developmental period 
as a result of the adoption of sab  revenues in the year were reported under a different basis of accounting than the prior two years  and are not directly comparable 
the adoption of sab in the year resulted in a decrease in revenues of  due to the amortization of license fees and milestones received in into future periods  partially offset by the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  for upfront license fees and milestone payments  received in  and now amortized over the developmental period  which ended june  for further discussion of sab see footnote to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
in addition to the research payments from lg chemical  which are included in the three years presented  research agreement revenue in year includes research payments from schering plough pursuant to the agreement discussed above 
collaborative research and development from related party of  in year is comprised of payments received from icos tbc pursuant to the limited partnership agreement  discussed above 
license fee and milestone income in year of  is comprised of a portion of license fees received from icos tbc and schering plough  pursuant to the agreements discussed above  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  for upfront license fees and milestone payments received from smithkline in  discussed above  and a milestone payment from smithkline in july  upon approval by the fda for the marketing of argatroban in the us for the indication of hit 
see footnotes and to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
research and development expenses increased approximately to million in  as compared to million in the increase is due to the research and development activities of revotar  which are included in the consolidated results of year  partially offset by general reductions in research and development costs resulting from the collaborative efforts begun in with icos tbc 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease from to was due primarily to the completion of certain phase ii clinical trials related to sitaxsentan tbc and the selectin antagonist programs net of expenses incurred during for the nda submission for argatroban 
a non cash charge for the purchase of in process research and development in of million was the result of common stock issued under a research collaboration agreement signed in in june  we issued  shares of common stock to genentech as a final payment on a license agreement 
previously  issuances under the agreement were charged to in process research and development expense 
this payment was required due to the approval of argatroban and therefore the value of  has been recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
amortization expense recorded in was approximately  and will be approximately  annually in future periods 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to million in as compared with million in the increase is primarily the result of higher employment expenses and costs associated with the recruiting of additional senior staff  the addition of revotar in  and costs associated with the management of the company s collaborative efforts  partially offset by reduced patent legal expenses related to endothelin  which are now the responsibility of icos tbc 
general and administrative expenses also increased approximately from million in to million in the increase in over was due primarily to approximately  accrued for settlement of a lawsuit  increased patent legal fees and increased consulting fees related to argatroban incurred in rent and related building service expense  which is a component of both research and development and general and administrative expenses  was approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the approximate  increase in as compared with was due to the added cost of additional space leased in late the increase of approximately  in from was due primarily to an increase in leased space during the company s proportionate share in losses incurred by icos tbc in was million 
there were no comparable amounts in the years and  as icos tbc was formed in june investment income in of million increased million from  primarily as a result of the increase in funds available for investment in  resulting from the license fees and milestone payments received in  and proceeds of the sale of common stock in a public offering in april  all as discussed above 
investment income in was higher than due to the investment of funds received in conjunction with the agreement with smithkline and a secondary public offering of common stock competed in october  discussed above 
the interest of the minority shareholders of revotar  who collectively hold approximately of the revotar common stock  in revotar s loss was  for the year  reducing the company s consolidated net loss 
as discussed above  the company implemented sab on october   effective january  the adoption of sab resulted in a cumulative increase in the company s losses for the years through of million resulting from the amortization of license fees and milestone payments  received in  through the development period  which ended june   reported in the year as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
revenues in year include the million deferred from  as discussed above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included herein 
we incurred net losses applicable to common shares of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss of million in year includes the million non cash cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  discussed above 
the reduction in the company s net loss in  as compared with  is due to the increased revenues and investment income  partially offset by increased expenses in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our research and development activities to date principally through o our initial public offering and subsequent public offerings of our common stock  o private placements of our common and preferred stock  o issuances of common stock in conjunction with acquisitions  research and collaboration agreements and upon exercises of stock options and warrants including our publicly traded warrants  o milestone and research payments received in conjunction with research and collaborative agreements  and o investment income  net of interest expense 
at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments of million including the cash of revotar 
on january   approximately million public warrants were exercised which provided us with approximately million in additional cash 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase during and subsequent years because o we will incur significant expenses in conjunction with the icos tbc partnership for endothelin antagonists and clinical trial costs for sitaxsentan and tbc compounds and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
o there will be additional costs in future periods related to argatroban in complying with ongoing fda requirements and possible clinical trial expenditures for additional therapeutic indications 
o our administrative costs and costs to commercialize our products will increase as our products are further developed and marketed 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we will require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development of our product candidates  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  if necessary  and to market our products 
we have accumulated approximately million in net losses through december  estimates of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including o market acceptance and commercial success of argatroban  o expenses and risks associated with clinical trials to expand the indications for argatroban  o continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  o the magnitude of these programs  o progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  o the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  o the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  o competing technological and market developments and changes in our existing research relationships  o our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements  and o effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
subject to these factors  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and other revenue sources  should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements in the foreseeable future without considering the impact of revenues from argatroban 
notwithstanding revenues  which may be produced through sales of potential future products if approved  we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funds to continue the required levels of research and development to reach our long term goals 
we intend to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available  or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing securities  further dilution of the equity ownership of existing stockholders will result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our drug discovery or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our ability to raise additional funding is contingent upon a number of factors which include o the market acceptance and commercial success of argatroban and expanded use of argatroban for other indications  o the ongoing cost of research and development activities  o the attainment of research and clinical goals of product candidates  o the timely approval of our product candidates by appropriate governmental and regulatory agencies  o the presence and effect of competitive products  o our ability to manufacture and market products commercially  o the retention of key personnel  and o conditions in the capital markets 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following describes the nature of this risk that is not believed to be material to us 
we have a majority owned subsidiary in berlin  germany and consolidate the results of operations into our consolidated financial results 
although not significant to date  our reported expenses and cash flows from this subsidiary are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we had an intercompany receivable from our berlin subsidiary at december   however this amount is denominated in us dollars and is not exposed to exchange risk 
we have contracts with entities in other areas outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  the currencies of these countries have not fluctuated materially 
at this time  we have not deemed it cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments
