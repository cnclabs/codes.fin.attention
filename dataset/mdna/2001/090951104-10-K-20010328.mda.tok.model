the following discussion and analysis of the corporation s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview the corporation is a leading contract service organization cso that provides testing and development  and manufacturing services for biologics and other biomedical products to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies worldwide 
the corporation follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
under sfas  the corporation reports the results of two operating segments testing and development services and manufacturing services 
the corporation evaluates the performance of these operating segments based on revenues and gross profit 
the corporation also reports separately the results of its us operations and european operations 
the corporation derived  and of its revenue from commercial contracts in  and  respectively  of which  and were testing and development contracts and  and were manufacturing contracts  respectively 
commercial contracts are either fixed price or fixed rate  and their terms range from under a day to three or more years 
revenue recognized from commercial contracts is predominately accounted for using the percentage of completion method  except for services that are completed within approximately three days  which are accounted for using the completed contract method 
percentage of completion is determined using total project costs as a cost input measure 
the corporation also follows the guidance in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
no commercial client accounted for more than of the corporation s revenue in the corporation derived  and of its revenue from government contracts in  and  respectively 
government contracts generally are cost plus fixed fee and have terms of three to five years 
revenue from government contracts is recognized in an amount equal to reimbursable costs plus a pro rata portion of the earned fee 
the corporation derived a significant portion of this revenue from government contracts that had been set aside for award to small businesses as defined under government regulations 
if the corporation continues to grow at a rate similar to its growth rate in  management estimates that within the next to months the corporation will no longer be eligible for small business set aside contracts and grants 
bioreliance enters into several different types of contractual relationships with its clients 
contracts in the testing and development business can be quotations  based upon established price lists for individual services  or work proposals  most often for larger studies composed of a variety of services 
a majority of testing and development contracts range in length from a few weeks to several months  however  some stability testing and lot release testing contracts may be one to three years in length 
manufacturing contracts tend to be relatively long because of the length of time required to create and characterize cell banks  perform pilot production runs  and produce and test the products 
these contracts require a formal statement of work and range in length from six months to over two years 
government contracts  usually multi year  are consistent with the requirements of the particular granting agency 
clients generally are invoiced either as work is completed or  for contracts in excess of  with a payment at the commencement of the services and progress payments based on defined milestones 
contracts may be terminated for a variety of reasons  including the client s decision to forego a particular study or to cancel or delay particular product development program  the failure of a clinical trial or unexpected or undesired results of product testing  or by the government for convenience 
generally  service contracts may be canceled by the client upon notice  with a partial charge commensurate with the percentage of work completed at the time of cancellation 
for both testing and development services and manufacturing services  the major components of cost of sales are labor and related fringe benefits  facilities  primarily rent or depreciation  utilities and maintenance  direct materials  overhead costs  such as travel  office expenses and employee related expenses  consulting costs and subcontracted costs 
cost of sales includes these expenses for laboratories directly providing the services and for supporting services departments  principally regulatory affairs  quality assurance and quality control 
in relative proportion to the total cost of sales  labor and materials costs are greater and facilities costs are less for testing and development services than for manufacturing services 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of labor and related fringe benefits  administrative materials  travel  legal  consulting  costs related to managing investor relations  and bad debt expense 
in addition  a portion of facilities and information systems costs are allocated to general and administrative departments 
research and development expense consists primarily of labor and related fringe benefits  materials  travel  and a portion of facilities cost 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table shows a comparison of revenue by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development   manufacturing   total   the increase in testing and development revenue in is attributed primarily to increased orders in both the us and europe 
the increase in us testing and development revenue results from increases in biosafety testing services and analytical services 
the increase in european testing and development is attributable to an increase in revenues generated in the uk  partially offset by a decrease in revenues generated in germany 
the corporation benefited from the establishment of new client relationships as well as the strengthening of existing relationships in these areas 
price increases did not provide a highly significant portion of the revenue increases in either of the corporation s business segments 
the increase in manufacturing revenues in is the result of significant increases in europe and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the us the us increase is primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing revenue for both phase i ii and phase iii services 
the increase in phase iii manufacturing revenue is a result of the corporation s opening of its new manufacturing facility during project delays resulting from requirements for additional process development and other client decisions  prior to completion of work  adversely affected us manufacturing revenue in the second half of the year 
during the third quarter of  bioreliance announced its selection as the principal provider of manufacturing services for a smallpox vaccine for military purposes and  separately  a teaming agreement to provide large scale manufacturing services for a new smallpox vaccine to create a national civil defense stockpile 
during the fourth quarter  the corporation announced that it was awarded a contract for the development and production of viral vectors to be used to test novel gene therapies 
these contracts have terms of up to years 
management expects the revenue from these contracts to grow over each of the next several years 
accordingly  while bioreliance expects these contracts will contribute to the corporation s revenues in  the revenues from these contracts are likely to be more significant in future years 
work under these contracts is subject to government issued task orders and thus the related revenues cannot be predicted with certainty 
like all government contracts  these contracts are subject to termination by the government at any time 
the following table shows a comparison of revenue by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states   europe   total   the increase in revenue generated in the united states for the year ended december  resulted from an increase in orders in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments 
this was achieved in part by having a full complement of account managers both in the us and europe 
us testing and development revenue was positively impacted by increased revenue generated in its toxicology and biosafety laboratories 
the increase in manufacturing revenue can be attributed to growth in orders and the resultant revenue for both phase i ii and phase iii services 
price increases did not provide a highly significant portion of the revenue increases in either of the corporation s geographic regions 
the increase in revenue generated in europe for the year ended december  reflects increases in both the testing and development and manufacturing revenue 
the increase in testing and development revenue generated in europe for year ended december  is related to an increase in testing and development revenue generated in the uk  partially offset by a decrease in testing and development revenue in germany 
during the second quarter of  the corporation began the consolidation of german testing and development services into its stirling  scotland uk operations 
european manufacturing revenue also increased in  as the corporation benefited from a strong performance from its manufacturing services in germany 
the corporation expects that testing and development revenue will continue to increase in the foreseeable future  and it expects that manufacturing revenue in the us will increase with the corporation s new contracts 
there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
european manufacturing services are currently running near their capacity and  therefore  further revenue growth in that segment and region likely will be modest  if at all  for the next year 
these expectations could be adversely affected by factors noted in the cautionary statements on page and the risk factors beginning on page the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development gross profit   gross margin manufacturing gross profit   gross margin totals gross profit   gross margin the increase in testing and development gross margin for the year ended december  can be attributed to increased gross profit generated in both the us and europe 
the increase was partially offset by increases in costs for labor  fringe benefits  direct materials  depreciation and non recurring subcontracting costs related to one development project 
the decrease in margins generated by manufacturing services is related to an increase in losses generated in us manufacturing partially offset by an increase in the gross profit generated in europe 
gross profit decreased as a result of increased costs for labor  fringe benefits  direct materials and capacity costs related to the new us manufacturing facility 
the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states gross profit   gross margin europe gross profit   gross margin totals gross profit   gross margin the increase in gross profit for the year ended december   for the united states resulted from increased revenue  partially offset by increased cost of sales in both testing and development and manufacturing  which are as discussed above 
the improvement in the gross profit for europe for the year ended december  can be primarily attributed to improved european margins in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments  resulting from increased utilization of capacity and a more favorable revenue mix 
the corporation expects margins in testing and development  both in the us and europe  to remain the same or improve with economies of scale in the foreseeable future  and expects manufacturing margins in the us to improve as capacity is more fully utilized 
these projected improvements could be adversely affected by factors noted in the cautionary statements on page and the risk factors beginning on page the following table shows a comparison of operating expenses  other than cost of sales  for the years ended december  and years ended december  change selling  general and administrative   research and development   total   the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due primarily to a decrease in labor and fringe costs due to fewer administrative employees and a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense  partially offset by an increase in consulting expenses 
bad debt expense decreased because of an improvement in the accounts receivable aging resulting from improved and enhanced collection efforts in the decrease was partially offset by restructuring expenses of million related to the consolidation of testing and development operations in germany with uk operations and consulting fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses may increase as the corporation implements additional client service applications for the corporation s information systems 
research and development expenses represent the investment of internal resources to develop new methods and tests to support the corporation s services 
these expenses have not changed significantly in the periods presented  but the corporation expects these expenses to increase modestly with an accelerated program of new assay development and commercial introductions 
the following table shows a comparison of non operating expenses for the years ended december  and years ended december  other expense income income taxes provision benefit effective rate the increase in net interest and other expense for the year ended december  reflects increases in interest and other expense  partially offset by an increase in interest income 
the increased interest expense can be attributed to the capital lease arrangements related to the new manufacturing facility opened during the provision for income tax for the year ended december  is the result of the corporation s generation of income before income taxes 
the low effective rate in was the consequence of different accounting treatment for various tax attributes in periods of net losses 
the corporation expects tax rates to remain at or below current levels in the foreseeable future  but since the corporation has international operations  its effective tax rate may vary from year to year due to changes in the distribution of its pre tax earnings 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following table shows a comparison of revenue by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development   manufacturing   total   the overall decrease in revenue for the year ended december  can be attributed to a decrease in orders in both segments 
the decrease in testing and development revenue can be attributed to decreased revenue generated in both the us and europe 
the decrease in testing and development revenue in the us can be primarily attributed to a decrease in testing services revenue  partially offset by an increase in development services revenue 
development services were positively impacted by an increase in biorepository revenue and revenue from analytical services 
the decrease in european testing and development revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in uk testing services  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue generated from german testing and development services 
uk testing and development revenue was adversely affected by client delays and a decrease in new orders 
the decrease in manufacturing revenue for year ended december  is attributable to decreases in both the us and europe 
the decrease in us manufacturing revenue is a result of the company s focus in the first half of the year on developing new client relationships and operational improvements and a delay in manufacturing projects at the end of the year 
revenue generated by european manufacturing operations is attributable to a decrease in german manufacturing revenues which were adversely impacted by client delays and delays in obtaining new contracts 
the decrease is partially offset by an increase in manufacturing revenue generated in the uk the following table shows a comparison of revenue by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states   europe   total   the decrease in revenue generated in the united states for the year ended december  resulted from decreased revenue in both the testing and development and manufacturing segments 
the decrease in us testing and development revenue was partially offset by increased revenue from analytical services and biorepository services discussed above 
us manufacturing revenue decreased as a result of the company s focus on client relationships and project delays discussed above 
the decrease in revenue generated in europe for the year ended december  reflects decreases in both the testing and development and manufacturing revenue 
decreases in uk testing and development revenue were partially offset by an increase in revenue generated from german testing and development 
the decrease in european manufacturing revenue is primarily the result of a decrease in revenue generated in germany  as discussed above 
the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by operational segment for the years ended december  and years ended december  change testing and development gross profit   gross margin manufacturing gross profit  nm gross margin totals gross profit   gross margin nm not meaningful the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  can be attributed to decreased revenue from both the testing and development and manufacturing segments and an increase in cost of sales in the testing and development segment  partially offset by decreased cost of sales in the manufacturing segment 
the increase in cost of sales is attributable to a shift in revenue mix leading to increases in direct materials  as well as increases in labor  fringe benefits and depreciation 
for the year ended december   margins for both segments were adversely affected by the increase in cost of sales discussed above 
margins for the manufacturing segment were also particularly affected by the significant manufacturing revenue decreases from the us and europe discussed above 
the following table compares gross profit and gross margin by geographic region for the years ended december  and years ended december  change united states gross profit   gross margin europe gross profit   gross margin totals gross profit   gross margin the decrease in the gross profit and the related margins for year ended december  resulted from decreases in both the us and european segments 
margins in both geographic segments were adversely affected by decreased revenue which is discussed above 
an increase in cost of sales in the us contributed to the decreased gross margin 
the decrease in european margins is partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales in europe for the year ended december  the following tables show a comparison of operating expenses  other than cost of sales  for the years ended december  and years ended december  change selling  general and administrative   research and development   total   the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due primarily to greater facility costs related to the full year of the corporation s occupancy of its new combined headquarters and laboratory facility  completed in the latter half of  as well as increased depreciation and other expenses related to the corporation s investments in an enterprise information system and an increase in the bad debt allowance 
the increase in the bad debt allowance was primarily the result of the ongoing reviews of customer projects and trade receivables 
research and development expenses represent the investment of internal resources to develop new methods and tests to support the corporation s services 
these expenses have not changed significantly in the periods presented 
the following table shows a comparison of non operating expenses for the years ended december  and years ended december  change other expense income income taxes benefit provision  nm effective rate nm not meaningful the decrease in net interest and other expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a decrease in interest income 
interest income decreased from million in to million in  due to a decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  remained relatively constant at million in and the benefit from income taxes for the year ended december  is the result of the corporation s loss before income taxes 
the low effective rate in was the consequence of different accounting treatment for various tax attributes in periods of net losses 
liquidity and capital resources the corporation has funded its business through existing cash  cash flows from operations  long term bank loans and capital leases 
at december   the corporation had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december  marketable securities are composed of investments in government securities  government agency securities and commercial paper with original maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase 
these marketable securities totaled and million at december  and  respectively 
in and  the corporation generated positive net cash flow from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
in  the corporation did not generate positive net cash flow from operating activities 
net income  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other non cash adjustments  provided cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of million in  primarily due to an increase in other accrued liabilities and customer advances  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
in changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of million in  primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued employee compensation and benefits  partially offset by decreases in customer advances  other accrued liabilities and an increase in deposits and other assets 
working capital decreased slightly to million at december   from million at december  this decrease was due to a decrease in current assets and an increase in current liabilities 
the decrease in current assets resulted from a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in current liabilities is the result of an increase in other accrued liabilities and customer advances  partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax and accounts payable 
additionally  the current portion of long term debt decreased as of december  because several of the corporation s capital equipment leases expired during the year 
the corporation leases facilities and equipment under leases that expire at various dates through which require the corporation to make noncancelable lease payments totaling approximately million 
the corporation s new manufacturing facility in rockville  maryland became operational in the second quarter of in april  the corporation entered into third party leasing and subleasing arrangements relating to the new manufacturing facility in rockville  maryland 
these arrangements require the corporation to make noncancelable lease payments totaling approximately million over the next eighteen years and to guarantee indebtedness of approximately million 
a portion of the lease payments is equivalent to the interest and principal due on the indebtedness 
in february  the corporation entered into an interest rate swap with respect to one of those leases whereby the variable interest rate portion of the indebtedness was effectively converted into debt with a fixed rate of per annum 
this swap expires on november  the terms of the arrangements require the corporation to account for the leases and subleases of the manufacturing facility as capital leases 
the assets underlying the capital leases are included with the corporation s owned property and equipment as of december  property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization at december  included approximately million related to these capital leases 
the related lease obligation is included in the corporation s liabilities at december  the build out and validation of the new us manufacturing facility has demanded and will continue to demand considerable time and resources 
the corporation is utilizing substantially less than full capacity in this building 
this operation will likely constrain earnings for the corporation at least through the second quarter of management cannot predict when  if ever  the facility will generate positive cash flow 
during  the corporation invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily related to leasehold improvements and equipment for the new manufacturing facility 
the corporation invested million and million in capital expenditures during and  respectively 
the corporation acquired additional capital assets under capital lease agreements of million and million in and  respectively 
at december   the corporation had commitments to spend approximately million in capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and laboratory equipment 
the corporation expects to continue expanding its operations through internal growth  geographic expansion and possibly strategic acquisitions 
the corporation expects to fund its growth and its planned capital expenditures from existing cash  cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and lease or other financing from third party sources to the extent that funds are available on favorable terms and conditions 
although the corporation has no agreements or arrangements in place with respect to any future acquisition  there may be acquisition or other growth opportunities that require additional external financing  and the corporation may  from time to time  seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities on a strategic basis 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to the corporation 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based on its current operating plan  the corporation believes that available liquid resources are sufficient to meet its operational and other foreseeable cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
borrowings and credit facilities in  the corporation obtained a mortgage loan of million from bank of america with a maturity date of november  the mortgage loan 
the mortgage loan was renewed in december and matures in november the mortgage loan requires a monthly principal payment of  per month  and bears interest at the london inter bank offering rate libor plus the applicable libor rate additional percentage libor rate option 
the libor rate option ranges from to depending on the corporation achieving funded debt to ebitda ratios 
at december   the applicable interest rate on the mortgage loan was and the libor rate option was 
approximately million was outstanding on the mortgage loan at december  from to  the corporation had in place an interest rate swap whereby the variable interest rate portion of the mortgage loan was effectively converted into debt with a fixed rate of per annum 
this swap expired on november  amounts paid or received under the interest rate swap were recognized as interest income or expense in the periods in which they accrued and were recorded in the same category as that arising from the mortgage loan 
the corporation believes that the effect of the interest rate swap on interest expense was not material in or in february  the corporation entered into a new interest rate swap whereby the variable interest rate portion of the mortgage loan was effectively converted into debt with a fixed rate of per annum 
this swap expires november  the corporation has available borrowings up to million under the terms of a revolving loan agreement with bank of america 
the revolving loan agreement requires monthly interest payments on the unpaid principal 
the loan matures on may   and the line of credit expires at that time 
amounts borrowed under the revolving loan agreement bear interest at the libor rate plus the applicable libor rate option which ranges from to depending on the corporation achieving funded debt to ebitda ratios 
there were no borrowings under this agreement in or the corporation financed the acquisition of bioreliance manufacturing gmbh formerly known as biomeva in july and obtained additional funds for working capital and expansion of its business through a promissory note with bank of america in the amount of million 
the note requires monthly principal payments of  and bears interest at the same rate as the mortgage loan 
at december   million was outstanding on the note  and the interest rate on the note was 
the note matures on june  all of the corporation s agreements with bank of america are cross collateralized and are secured by a deed of trust on one of the corporation s laboratory facilities in rockville  maryland 
the agreements require the corporation to comply with financial and restrictive covenants  including fixed charge coverage and funded debt to ebitda ratios 
specifically maintain a ratio of total funded indebtedness to ebitda not greater than to as of the end of each fiscal quarter  calculated on the preceding four quarter period 
for the fiscal quarter ended december   this ratio was based on the preceding three quarter period on an annualized basis 
ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each quarter of at least to 
this ratio is determined by dividing ebitda by the sum of interest expense and current maturities of long term debt and capital leases 
at december   the corporation was in compliance with all covenants under its loan agreements 
on july   the corporation received the proceeds of a  loan from the department of business and economic development  a department of the state of maryland 
the corporation is required to use the proceeds to expand and relocate its activities in rockville  maryland 
the loan requires quarterly principal payments of  plus accrued interest and matures on june  the loan bears interest at rates ranging from to based on the corporation s achieving specific employment levels over the next six years 
there is currently no interest being charged on this loan 
the terms of the loan contain annual reporting requirements  including the reporting of employment data 
at december   approximately million was outstanding on the loan 
foreign currency the accounts of the corporation s international subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at period end exchange rates  and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates 
net exchange gains and losses resulting from these translations are excluded from net income and are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
translation gains and losses that arise from some intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the corporation recorded net exchange losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since the revenues and expenses of the corporation s international operations generally are denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the united states dollar will subject the corporation to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of its international operations as well as to other risks sometimes associated with international operations 
the corporation derived  and of its revenue for  and  respectively  from services performed outside of the united states 
in addition  the corporation may be subject to currency risk when the corporation s service contracts are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the corporation incurs expenses related to such contracts 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience fluctuations in financial results from the corporation s operations outside the united states  and there can be no assurance the corporation will be able  contractually or otherwise  to reduce the currency risks associated with its operations 
at the present time  the corporation does not use derivative financial instruments to manage or control foreign currency risk because most of its revenue and related expenses are in the same functional currencies 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not use such financial instruments in the future or that any such use will be successful in managing or controlling foreign currency risk 
see item a market risk 
the revenue and identifiable assets attributable to the corporation s geographic regions are reported in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash banking transactions 
on or before july   the participating countries are planned to withdraw all legacy currency and use the euro exclusively 
the introduction of the euro has not had a material adverse effect on the corporation  and it does not anticipate any material adverse effects as other currencies are phased out 
however  unforeseen legislation  changes in commercial cross border practices or a significant devaluation of the euro could have an adverse effect on the future results of operations and financial position of the corporation

risk factors the business and future operating results of bioreliance could differ materially from the descriptions in this report due to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
dependence on outsourcing for development of biologics  market acceptance of biologics the corporation s revenues are highly dependent on research  development and manufacturing expenditures by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development of biologics 
the corporation has benefited to date from the growing tendency of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to outsource product development projects to csos 
a decline in the development of biologics  a general decline in research and development expenditures by these companies  or a delay or reduction in the outsourcing to csos of research and development expenditures due to market conditions  pharmaceutical industry consolidation or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
the corporation s business strategy is dependent upon market acceptance of biologics 
the market for biologics is still emerging  and most biologic products are still in the research and development stage 
the extent to which biologics are accepted in commercial markets will affect the corporation s business  results of operations and financial condition 
significant capital expenditures during  the corporation invested million in capital expenditures primarily related to completion of its new us manufacturing facility for a total investment in the facility of million  and may spend up to million on capital expenditures during management cannot predict when  if ever  its new manufacturing facility will generate positive cash flow 
there is a risk that the return on these capital expenditures may be less than expected 
risks associated with the nature of contracts most of the corporation s contracts are short term in duration 
as a result  the corporation must continually replace its contracts with new contracts to sustain its revenue 
the corporation s inability to generate new contracts on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  many of the corporation s long term contracts may be cancelled or delayed by clients for any reason upon notice 
contracts may be terminated for a variety of reasons  including termination of product development  failure of products to satisfy safety requirements  unexpected or undesired results from use of the product or the client s decision to forego a particular study 
such terminations are somewhat common in the cso industry  and have affected the corporation s revenues in the past 
the failure to obtain new contracts or the cancellation or delay of existing contracts could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
government contracts may be terminated during fiscal  approximately of the corporation s revenues were from government contracts 
a government contract may be modified or terminated at any time for the convenience of the government  including for changes in requirements or reductions in budgetary resources 
any termination of our government contracts  particularly our newly awarded contracts would have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
revenues difficult to predict the corporation s revenues are difficult to predict because they are primarily generated on a contract by contract basis 
most of the contracts are short term  and may be canceled at any time 
consequently  the corporation does not have a significant backlog 
as a result  the corporation s revenues are not recurring from period to period  which contributes to the variability of results from period to period 
variation in quarterly operating results  high fixed costs the corporation s revenues and operating results have fluctuated  and could continue to fluctuate  on a quarterly basis 
the operating results for a particular quarter may be lower than expected as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of contracts  the delay or cancellation of a contract  the mix of services provided  seasonal slowdowns in europe during the summer months  the timing of start up expenses for new services and facilities  and changes in regulations related to biologics 
because a high percentage of the corporation s costs are fixed such as the cost of maintaining facilities and compensating employees  any one of these factors could have a significant impact on the corporation s quarterly results 
in some quarters the corporation s revenues and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above 
in such event  the trading price of the corporation s common stock would likely decline  even if the decline in revenues did not have any long term adverse implications for the corporation s business 
management of growth the corporation s operations both domestic and international have grown in recent years 
this growth has placed a strain on the corporation s management  operational  human and financial resources 
in order to manage its growth  the corporation must continue to improve its operating and administrative systems  including its financial and accounting systems  and continue to attract and retain qualified management and professional  scientific and technical operating personnel

competition  industry consolidation the corporation operates in a highly competitive industry 
the cso industry is highly fragmented  with many providers ranging in size from one person consulting firms to full service global drug development corporations 
the corporation primarily competes with in house research departments of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  universities and medical centers  and other csos 
as a result of competitive pressures  the industry is consolidating 
mergers and acquisitions have resulted in the emergence of several large  full service csos that have greater capital  technical and financial resources than bioreliance 
as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies increasingly outsource development  they may increasingly turn to larger csos that provide a full range of services 
this trend is likely to produce increased competition among the larger csos for both clients and acquisition candidates and increased competitive pressures on smaller providers 
in addition  the cso industry has attracted the attention of the investment community  which could lead to heightened competition by increasing the availability of financial resources for csos 
increased competition may lead to price and other forms of competition that may have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations

in addition  the corporation s services include the manufacture of biologic products to be tested in human clinical trials 
these activities could expose the corporation to risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products  although the corporation does not commercially market or sell the products to end users 
the corporation seeks to reduce its potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with clients the scope of which may vary from client to client  and the performances of which are not secured and insurance maintained by clients 
the corporation could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements  if the indemnity  although applicable  is not performed in accordance with its terms or if the corporation s liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance or indemnity 
in addition  the corporation could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services it performs 
the corporation currently maintains product liability and errors and omissions insurance with respect to these risks

the corporation s business depends in part on strict government regulation of the drug development process  especially in the united states 
legislation may be introduced and enacted from time to time to modify regulations administered by the fda governing the drug approval process 
any significant reduction in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
all of the corporation s testing assays are performed in conformity with either glp regulations or current gmp regulations 
glps and gmps are parts of the fda regulations and guidelines governing the development and production of biologic and pharmaceutical products 
failure by the corporation to comply with applicable requirements could result in the disqualification of data for client submissions to regulatory authorities and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business and results of operations 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used for manufacturing of products for clinical use or for sale in the united states must be operated in conformity with current gmp regulations 
the corporation s facilities are subject to scheduled periodic regulatory inspections to ensure compliance with gmp requirements
