the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes

to mitigate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations  the company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
the agreement expired on december  in mid january  the company entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flow to be exchanged and does not represent exposure to credit loss 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company currently does not hedge its foreign currency exposure and  therefore  has not entered into any forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
the company has operations outside the united states with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily denominated in italian lira  canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
because the company has foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
the unhedged foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of december  are not expected to result in a significant impact on earnings or cash flows
