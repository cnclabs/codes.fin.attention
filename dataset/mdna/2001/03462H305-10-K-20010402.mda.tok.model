item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the year was a year of significant transition for the company 
it included the winding down of the company s historic icd business and beginning the implementation of a growth strategy for the medical graphics subsidiary that was acquired in december of in addition  represented a difficult year for the core medical graphics business which was negatively affected by reductions in hospital capital budgets 
by march of  it became evident that the company would not be able to compete effectively in the icd market and that the assets of its medical graphics subsidiary represented both the majority of the company s total assets and the company s only operating revenue generating business 
as a result  the company elected to exit the icd business and focus its growth efforts on building off the medical graphics foundation 
accordingly  the company closed agreements for the licensing and transfer of certain icd assets to medtronic  inc and ela medical 
these transactions brought in approximately million in cash before transaction costs and resulted in the retirement of approximately  shares of the company s common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares including warrants to purchase  shares at per share 
in addition  in march  the company began the implementation of its growth strategy by acquiring the assets of aerosport  inc aerosport s products had been primarily marketed in the sports fitness and elite athletes training markets 
the combination of aerosport s products and technologies with certain of the company s core products and technologies significantly reduce the cost and complexity of using gas exchange measurement for certain applications 
as a result  the company is able to broaden its market from the relatively small and slow growth hospital laboratory market to cardiac rehabilitation centers  health fitness clubs and weight loss centers 
these markets are larger and offer greater potential for growth 
in december  the company announced that it was focusing a significant portion of its resources on the cardiac rehabilitation and disease prevention markets  which are a logical extension of its core business and leverage the aerosport products and technologies 
the company also entered into a letter of intent and term sheet with a privately held georgia corporation engaged in the business of developing and delivering risk assessment and lifestyle management materials and services to patients for improved cardio vascular health 
the company believes that the combination of these new products and services and the company s technology will allow the company to offer a complete system for cardiac rehabilitation and disease prevention 
the agreement with gives the company exclusive distribution rights to a cardiac rehabilitation product for testing until july  in exchange for payments of  over a six month period 
these payments may be applied  at the company s discretion  toward either the purchase of the cardiac rehabilitation products or equity in the georgia corporation 
the company has the right to continue the distribution agreement for up to an additional six months for additional payments of  per month during the extension period 
the letter of intent and term sheet also defines the general terms under which the company has the right  but not the obligation  to acquire the georgia corporation during the distribution period 
finally  as a result of negotiations begun in  the company secured exclusive distribution rights for a proprietary biofeedback device that the company believes will be useful for patients in cardiac rehabilitation and healthy or at risk consumers who wish to improve their cardio vascular health or lose weight 
in january  the company successfully completed these negotiations for exclusive distribution rights in the united states hospital  cardiac rehabilitation clinics  cardiology clinics  fitness clubs  and weight loss center markets for years 
the company has the right to renew the agreement for an additional year period if certain minimum performance goals are met 
moreover  the company also received non exclusive international distribution rights in the above markets with certain rights of first refusal for exclusive international distribution rights 
the combination of these products and strategies positions the company to pursue a billion unites states cardiac rehabilitation and disease prevention market
