item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of the statements in this report  including in the documents incorporated by reference  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include statements about our plans  objectives  expectations  intentions and assumptions and other statements contained in this report  including in the documents incorporated by reference  that are not statements of historical fact 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements about our ability to manufacture and scale up commercially the glucowatch biographer  plans for commercialization alliances  our ability to achieve market acceptance of the glucowatch biographer  and plans for enhancements and possible manufacturing changes through the pma supplement process 
in some cases  you can identify these statements by words such as may  will  should  estimates  predicts potential  continue  strategy  believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions 
we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a discrepancy include those discussed below in risk factors and elsewhere in this report  including in the documents incorporated by reference 
general we are engaged in the development and manufacture of diagnostic medical devices  utilizing proprietary technologies to satisfy unmet medical needs cost effectively 
our current efforts are primarily focused on a frequent  automatic and non invasive glucose monitoring device  the glucowatch biographer for which we received fda approval in march  and enhancements thereto 
in  we sold substantially all of our drug delivery business to ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  and chose to focus on glucose monitoring systems 
the drug delivery business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and prior years financial statements have been restated to report only continuing operations 
for us to remain competitive  we will need to develop  in license or acquire new diagnostic products 
our results of operations vary significantly from year to year and have in the past largely depended on the signing of new product development agreements and the timing of recognizing payment amounts specified thereunder  the timing of recognizing license or distribution fees and cost reimbursement payments made by licensees and the demand for our products 
the level of revenues in any given period is not necessarily indicative of expected revenues for future periods 
in  of our revenues were attributable to one customer 
we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and do not believe we will achieve profitability at least in at december   our accumulated deficit and net capital deficiency were approximately million and million  respectively 
results of operations the drug delivery business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and prior years financial statements have been restated to report only continuing operations 
as a result  no product revenues  royalty revenues or costs of products sold have been reflected in our financial statements 
comparison for the years ended december  and contract revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues consisted primarily of the amortization of a milestone payment associated with the glucowatch biographer received from yamanouchi pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in the majority of this milestone payment was amortized in  which resulted in decreased contract revenue when compared to contract revenue 
revenue from the two six month phase i small business innovative research sbir grants in the aggregate amount of  is recognized as reimbursable expenses are incurred 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in expenses incurred to develop and test large scale manufacturing processes for the autosensor 
research  development and clinical activities primarily included support and development for the glucose monitoring program 
we anticipate that the development of new products and technologies  along with additional clinical trials  will result in an increase in our overall research and development expenses in marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to our increased marketing efforts including the establishment of a subsidiary and infrastructure in preparation for a commercial launch in the united kingdom and the development and preparation of sales and marketing materials and non cash  stock based compensation 
we expect that marketing  general and administrative expenses will increase in as we plan for commercialization of our glucowatch biographer 
other income and expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to a one time  non recurring charge in connection with the write down of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the retirement of the senior subordinated convertible notes in june in addition  interest income earned for the year ended december  increased in conjunction with the higher average year cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb required companies to adopt a new methodology for computing the beneficial conversion feature of convertible securities  which is to be applied retroactively for commitments entered into on or after may  accordingly  we recorded a one time  non cash charge of million to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as required under the guidance provided by the eitf 
discontinued operations 
no revenues or net income was recognized on the discontinued operations for the year ended december  as a result of the sale of our drug delivery business 
total revenues and net income on the discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in  we also recorded a gain of million on the disposal of our drug delivery business 
comparison for the years ended december  and contract revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to the million for the year ended december  contract revenues primarily reflect the amortization of previously deferred and additional milestone payments relating to the glucowatch biographer 
the increase in contract revenue was primarily due to the amortization of an additional milestone payment received in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects a reduction in clinical studies and development expenditures associated with the glucowatch biographer 
research  development and clinical activities primarily included support and development for the glucose monitoring program 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced compensation and market research expenses 
other income and expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the recording in of the million non cash costs of the beneficial conversion feature associated with the october restructuring of the senior subordinated convertible notes and write off of the previously deferred debt issuance cost of million  in conjunction with the partial repayment of the senior subordinated convertible notes  offset by a net arbitration settlement with pharmacia upjohn  from which cygnus received million 
income loss from operations of a discontinued segment for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a decrease in overall segment expenses 
discontinued operations 
total revenues and net income on the discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in  we also recorded a gain of million on the disposal of the segment 
inflation while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on our operations have been immaterial 
financing instruments in june  we entered into two financing arrangements a convertible debenture and warrant purchase agreement convertible debenture and a structured equity line flexible financing sm agreement equity line 
under the convertible debenture  convertible debentures having a principal amount of million were issued at a conversion price of per share 
principal is due june  the convertible debenture also provided for an additional million  composed of two million tranches  and in september we received million in gross proceeds from the issuance of the first additional tranche  having a conversion price of and due september  the million second additional tranche is still available under this financing instrument 
the equity line originally had a maximum aggregate issue price of million over a two year commitment period and allows us  at our sole discretion  to sell common stock over this period 
in we received proceeds of approximately million from the original million 
these proceeds resulted from the sale of approximately  shares of common stock pursuant to the equity line 
in may  the equity line was amended to increase the maximum aggregate issue price by an additional million to a total of million  to provide for the issuance of warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock  to replace the calculation used to determine the per share price with a formula more favorable to the company and to extend the commitment period 
in  we received additional proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds resulted from the sale of approximately  shares of common stock pursuant to the equity line 
thus  as of december   we have received approximately million and have million available under the amended equity line 
since december   we have received an additional million of proceeds  leaving million available under the equity line 
in march  we terminated the existing amended equity line and entered into a new equity line with the same investors for a maximum aggregate issue price of million 
the terms and conditions of this new equity line are substantially the same as the prior amended equity line 
we now have million available under the new equity line 
five year warrants have been issued under our financing instruments 
in conjunction with the convertible debenture  warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share were issued in at the dates of grant  the fair values ascribed to these warrants were approximately million and million  respectively  based on a black scholes valuation model  and these amounts are being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the debt 
we recorded amortization of million for the three months ended december  and million for the months ended december  as of december   the unamortized fair value amounted to million 
in conjunction with the equity line  in january we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as of december  totaled million 
we have received net proceeds of approximately million from public offerings of our common stock through december  since inception  we have financed approximately million of manufacturing and research equipment under capital loan and lease arrangements 
borrowings under those arrangements are secured by specific cygnus assets 
we have an outstanding bank loan agreement with silicon valley bank that requires monthly principal and interest payments through august  in addition to compliance with various financial covenants 
as of december   there was million outstanding under this agreement  and borrowings are secured by specific cygnus assets 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with net cash used of million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  and december  was primarily due to the net loss from continuing operations of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the receipt of million from the sale of the drug delivery business  net sales of investments of million  offset by capital expenditures of million and a contract termination fee of  in conjunction with disposal of the drug delivery segment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  and included net proceeds of million from the sales of common stock under our equity line and additional stock proceeds of million  offset by long term debt repayments of million 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  included net proceeds of million and million from the june and september issuance of convertible debenture and from the sale of common stock under the equity line  respectively  and additional stock proceeds of million  offset by the july redemption of senior subordinated convertible notes of million  and long term debt and capital lease repayments of million and million  respectively 
the current level of cash used in operating activities is not necessarily indicative of the level of future cash usage 
our long term capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to  i the progress of our research and development programs  ii the time required to obtain regulatory approvals  iii the resources that we devote to manufacturing  distribution and marketing of our products  iv the additional expenditures to support the manufacture of new products  if and when approved  and v possible acquisitions of products and technologies 
as we evaluate the progress of our development projects  our commercialization plans and the lead time to set up manufacturing capabilities  we may commence long term planning for another manufacturing site 
nevertheless  we believe that such long term planning will not result in any material impact on cash flows and liquidity for the next months 
we have entered into agreements to allow us to manufacture and commercialize our glucowatch biographer 
these contracts do not result in any material commitment for the next months 
based upon current expectations for operating losses and projected short term capital expenditures  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december  when coupled with cash available from public financings including debt or equity financings and any potential collaborations and earnings from investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  debt servicing and repayments and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing  depending upon future business strategies  manufacturing and commercialization efforts  results of clinical trials  management decisions to accelerate certain research and development programs  and other factors 
income taxes we recorded a  income tax provision for the year ended december  consisting entirely of foreign withholding taxes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a substantial portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
arbitration obligation we have accrued an aggregate liability of million relating to an arbitration settlement agreement with sanofi synthelabo 
we have issued to sanofi synthelabo a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of million  payable in full in december in addition  we are obligated to make a payment of million in the first quarter of  and payments of million  million  million and million are due in the first quarters of through  respectively 
risk factors we wish to caution stockholders and other investors that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of cygnus 
the statements under this caption are intended to serve as cautionary statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the following information is not intended to limit in any way the characterization of other statements or information under other captions as cautionary statements for such purpose 
we may not continue to receive regulatory approval on our products from the fda and or foreign agencies 
if we do not receive regulatory approval  we will not be able to sell our products or generate revenue in that jurisdiction 
the design  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and marketing of our products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the united states and certain other countries where the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearance or approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the fda may not approve enhancements and possible manufacturing changes to the glucowatch biographer or it may require us to file one or more new pre market approval pma applications rather than allowing us to use a supplement to our existing pma application  which was approved in march in addition  a delay in such fda approval could substantially delay introduction of product enhancements and our ability to cost effectively manufacture large quantities of the consumable component of our glucowatch biographer 
regulatory requirements and procedures also vary on a country by country basis  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval in foreign countries 
moreover  even if regulatory approval is granted  such approval may include significant limitations on indicated uses for which any such products could be marketed 
a medical device and its manufacturer are subject to continual review after approval  and later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the manufacturing process may result in restrictions on such product or the manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
in addition  new government regulations may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our potential products 
we are also subject to federal  state and local regulations regarding workplace safety  environmental protection and hazardous material controls  among others 
in order for us to market our products in foreign jurisdictions  we and any of our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions 
specifically  certain foreign regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  import restrictions  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
these regulations vary from country to country 
failure to receive foreign regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals in such countries or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining such regulatory registrations or approvals 
delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required to market our products  failure to receive these registrations or approvals or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our product pipeline is severely limited  so the failure of any one product could result in the failure of our entire business 
in  we sold substantially all of the assets of our drug delivery business segment to ortho mcneil and terminated our remaining drug delivery projects 
we are now exclusively focused on diagnostic medical devices and initially on a line of frequent  automatic and non invasive glucose monitoring devices 
a narrow range of products subjects us to the risk of not having alternative sources of revenue if we are unable to commercialize our narrow line of products 
we may not be successful with a non diversified line of products 
a failure of our initial product  the glucowatch biographer  could cut off our only potential source of revenue and result in the failure of our entire business  as could the failure of any of our future products 
for cygnus to be successful  we will need to continue to develop glucose monitoring products that address the needs of people with diabetes 
enhanced glucose monitoring products based on our technologies are currently under development 
in addition  we will be evaluating new products outside of the glucose monitoring field that can utilize our diagnostic technologies 
these products will require significant additional development and investment  including preclinical and clinical testing  prior to their commercialization 
from time to time  we have experienced delays or setbacks in the development of certain of our products 
for example  in the past  we experienced development delays in the miniaturization of the glucowatch biographer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address problems that may arise during the development and commercialization process 
in addition  there can be no assurance that glucowatch biographer enhancements or future products can or will be successfully developed  prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being manufactured in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost  be marketed successfully or achieve market acceptance 
if any of our development programs are not successfully completed  required regulatory approvals or clearances are not obtained or products for which approvals or clearances are obtained are not commercially successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to the risks inherent in the development of new products using new technologies and approaches 
there can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not develop with these technologies or applications  that we will be able to successfully address technological challenges we encounter in our research and development programs or that we will be able to develop commercially feasible products 
we do not have medical device marketing  distribution  manufacturing or sales experience 
if we are unable to make satisfactory arrangements for each of these  we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products 
we may have problems in manufacturing  commercial scale up  marketing or distribution of our glucowatch biographer 
we do not have any experience in any of these areas in the medical device field 
to successfully market  distribute  manufacture and sell the glucowatch biographer and our other glucose monitoring products under development  we must either develop these capabilities ourselves or enter into arrangements with third parties 
we may not succeed in either course of action 
if we attempt to develop our own capabilities  we will incur significant start up expenses and we will compete with other companies that have experienced and well funded operations 
if we enter into arrangements with third parties  any revenues we receive will depend on the third party  and we will likely have to pay fees  sales commissions or similar amounts 
if we are unable to make satisfactory arrangements  we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products or may experience delays in commercialization 
our glucowatch biographer has been manufactured for commercial sale on a limited basis  and we have no experience manufacturing the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales 
to successfully commercialize the glucowatch biographer  we will have to manufacture the device in compliance with regulatory requirements  in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities while maintaining product performance  quality and acceptable manufacturing costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain reliable  full scale manufacturing of the glucowatch biographer at commercially reasonable prices 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving product performance  production yields  quality control and assurance  and shortages of personnel 
in addition  manufacturing facilities will be subject to extensive regulations  including international quality standards and other regulatory requirements 
difficulties encountered in manufacturing scale up or failure by us to implement and maintain manufacturing facilities in accordance with international quality standards or other regulatory requirements could result in a delay or termination of production  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the past  we have experienced these problems in scaling up our transdermal drug delivery products for commercial launch 
there can be no assurance that similar problems will not be encountered in the future with our new diagnostic devices 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and maintain product performance  quality and reliability if and when we are able to produce our glucowatch biographer in the quantities required for commercialization  or that the glucowatch biographer will be able to be manufactured and assembled at an acceptable cost 
we may need to rely on agreements with third parties in order to commercialize our products on a worldwide basis 
if we are unable to secure these necessary agreements  we may not be able to sell our products or generate revenue 
one of our priorities is to establish alliances to secure commercialization functions worldwide for the glucowatch biographer  such as distribution  sales and customer service 
we do not currently have any marketing or distribution agreements in the united states for the glucowatch biographer other than an agreement with livingston healthcare services to provide receiving  storage  customer service  technical support and shipment services as well as an agreement with lifescan  inc relating to our pilot marketing program in the united states 
we do not have a worldwide commercialization partner 
our agreement with yamanouchi to commercialize the glucowatch biographer in japan was terminated in october we may never enter into an agreement with a worldwide commercialization partner 
even if we obtain a worldwide commercialization partner  we may not do so until after the fda approves our large scale manufacturing process 
we are currently outsourcing capabilities for launch without a worldwide commercialization alliance 
we may not be able to outsource some commercialization capabilities in time for a broad launch 
third parties performing these outsourced capabilities may  for competitive reasons  support  directly or indirectly  a company or product that competes with one of our products 
if a third party terminates an arrangement  cannot fund or otherwise satisfy its obligations under its arrangements or disputes or breaches a contractual commitment  then we would likely be required to seek an alternative third party 
if we were unable to find a replacement third party  we might not be able to perform or fund the activities of the current third party  or our capital requirements could increase substantially 
we may need additional financing and it may not be available 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  which could negatively impact our product commercialization 
in order to continue to develop our diagnostic product line  we will require substantial resources to conduct research and development and clinical trials necessary to bring our products to market and to establish production and marketing capabilities 
although we currently have two financing instruments in place  we may seek additional funding through public or private financings  including debt or equity financings 
we may also seek other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
any additional equity financings may dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may restrict our ability to issue dividends in the future and take other actions 
we may not be able to obtain adequate funds when we need them from financial markets or arrangements with commercialization partners or other sources 
even if funds are available  they may not be on acceptable terms 
if we cannot obtain sufficient additional funds  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs or license or sell products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves 
the amounts and timing of future expenditures will depend on progress of ongoing research and development  results of clinical trials  rates at which operating losses are incurred  executing possible commercialization agreements  developing our products  manufacturing the glucowatch biographer  the fda regulatory process  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we are highly leveraged and may be unable to service our debt 
if we cannot pay amounts due under our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell all or a portion of our assets or sell equity securities 
as of december   we had indebtedness of approximately million  of which million is scheduled to become due and payable in the degree to which we are leveraged could limit our ability to obtain financing for working capital  commercialization of products or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our future performance  which will depend upon financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
although we believe our cash flows will be adequate to meet our interest payments  we may not continue to generate cash flows in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges or to permit us to satisfy any redemption obligations pursuant to our indebtedness 
if we cannot generate cash flows in the future sufficient to cover our fixed charges or to permit us to satisfy any redemption obligations pursuant to our indebtedness and we cannot borrow sufficient funds either under our credit facilities or from other sources  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell all or a portion of our assets  or sell equity securities 
we may not successfully complete any of these courses of action 
in the event of insolvency  bankruptcy  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or winding up of our business or upon default or acceleration relating to our debt obligations  our assets will first be available to pay the amounts due under our debt obligations 
holders of common stock would only receive the assets remaining  if any  after payment of all indebtedness and preferred stock  if any 
we have incurred substantial losses  have a history of operating losses  have an accumulated deficit and expect continued operating losses 
we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  and have experienced annual operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses at least until we have significant sales  if we ever do  of the glucowatch biographer 
we may never generate significant revenues or achieve profitability 
we may fail in our efforts to introduce our products or to obtain required regulatory clearances 
our products may never gain market acceptance  and we may never generate revenues or achieve profitability 
our revenues to date have been derived primarily from product development and licensing fees related to our products under development and manufacturing and royalty revenues from our discontinued operations 
if we obtain regulatory approvals  we expect to significantly increase our level of expenditures for sales  marketing and general and administrative activities in connection with product commercialization  and these expenditures will precede commercial revenues  if any 
our stock price is volatile  and you may not be able to resell cygnus shares at or above the price you paid  or at all 
the market price for shares of our common stock has been highly volatile 
factors such as the results of clinical trials for our products or products of our competitors  announcements of technological innovations  commencement or termination of strategic relationships  new product introductions by us or our competitors  regulatory approvals or delays  changes in securities analysts recommendations and developments relating to our patent or proprietary rights or those of our competitors  as well as period to period fluctuations in financial results  may have a significant impact on the market price of the common stock 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and even in recent months that have particularly affected the market prices of many medical technology companies  unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
fluctuations or decreases in the trading price of our common stock may discourage investors from purchasing our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price for a company s securities  securities class action litigation often has been instituted 
such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert management s attention and resources from developing and commercializing the glucowatch biographer 
ownership dilution caused by the issuance of shares under the equity line or by additional shares of our common stock becoming available for sale in the future could lower our stock price 
if our stock price declines  you may not be able to resell our shares at or above the price you paid  or at all 
under the equity line  each month we may sell up to million of common stock and our investors may exercise their option to purchase  subject to our approval  up to an additional million of common stock during each month in an investment period 
the total number of shares that may be issued under the equity line depends on the market price of our common stock at the time that the shares are sold  whether we choose to sell shares  and the number of shares we choose to sell 
the following table illustrates hypothetically the effect of variations in the market price in our common stock and resulting variations in sales prices to our investors  on the number of shares issued in a one month period  assuming that we choose to sell all possible shares under the equity line 
this table illustrates hypothetically how the ownership dilution resulting from the sale of the maximum number of shares available under the equity line increases as the market value of our common stock declines 
price per share number of shares issued one month our decision to choose to sell all possible shares under the equity line would be influenced by whether it is in the best interests of our stockholders to sell at lower market prices  given our financing requirements and access to alternative sources of financing 
we expect to satisfy substantially all of our expected financing needs during through sales under the equity line 
under our new march equity line  we have also agreed to issue warrants to purchase shares in an amount equal to percent of the number of shares issued under the new equity line in any given year 
the warrants will be issued after the end of each calendar year 
the warrants are exercisable for five years from the date they are issued at an exercise price based on the weighted average price at which shares were sold during the preceding calendar year 
if our stock trades below per share for consecutive trading days  our shares could be de listed from the nasdaq stock market 
if our shares are de listed  our stockholders may experience substantially decreased liquidity in their shares  and the outstanding amounts under our convertible debenture could become immediately due and payable 
our stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market 
nasdaq requires companies  such as ours  without at least million in net tangible assets  to maintain a minimum closing bid of per share for consecutive business days for continued listing 
a company whose stock does not meet this criterion may be put on probationary notice 
if  after probationary notice  such a stock has not maintained a bid price for consecutive trading days over the next days  nasdaq may institute de listing proceedings 
in the event nasdaq were to institute de listing procedures on our stock  we plan to explore the possibility of a reverse stock split to maintain our listing 
if our stock is de listed from the nasdaq stock market  our stockholders would find it more difficult to dispose of their shares  or obtain accurate quotations as to their market value  and the market price of our stock would likely decline further 
additionally  under the terms of our convertible debenture  we are required to maintain our listing with nasdaq 
we currently have outstanding convertible debentures in the amount of million including accrued interest 
in the event our shares are de listed  the holders could assert that a default has occurred 
a default would result in all outstanding principal and interest becoming immediately due and payable 
payment of these amounts would require us to obtain alternative financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and could lead to bankruptcy 
intense competition in the market for glucose diagnostic products could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the medical device industry  particularly the market in which we will offer the glucowatch biographer  is intensely competitive and we will compete with other providers of personal glucose monitors 
currently the market is dominated by finger stick blood glucose monitoring products sold by a few major companies 
these companies have established products and distribution channels 
finger stick glucose monitoring presents a number of barriers to generating more frequent blood glucose measurements  including the pain of repetitive finger sticking and the disruption of normal activities  as often people with diabetes do not want to go through the finger stick process in public 
several companies are developing alternative invasive  semi invasive  minimally invasive or non invasive methods to monitor glucose levels in a less painful or painless manner  as well as on a continuous or continual basis 
companies are attempting to develop a variety of methods to extract interstitial fluid and measure the glucose concentration therein 
another technology that some companies are pursuing is the use of infrared spectroscopy  which uses radiation to measure glucose levels 
we are not aware of any products under development that offer the range of potential benefits of the glucowatch biographer 
however  there can be no assurance that other products will not be more accepted in the marketplace than the glucowatch biographer or will not render our devices noncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  the glucowatch biographer or our other enhanced products under development may fail to replace any currently used devices or systems 
a number of companies have developed or are seeking to develop new drugs to treat diabetes that could reduce demand for glucose monitoring systems 
in addition  many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater resources  research and development staffs and facilities than we do and have significantly greater experience in developing  manufacturing and marketing glucose monitoring devices 
competition within the glucose monitoring industry could also result in price reductions for glucose monitoring devices such that we may not be able to sell the glucowatch biographer at a price level adequate for us to realize a return on our investment 
if the market does not accept our new type of products  we may not generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability 
we are focusing our efforts predominantly on a line of frequent  automatic and non invasive glucose monitoring devices 
the market may not accept our products  given that they are different from the established finger stick glucose monitors currently on the market 
additionally  some of our competitors have announced  and others may be developing  new glucose monitoring devices that are frequent  automatic and less invasive 
the introduction of competing products may decrease our future market sales 
if third parties do not reimburse the costs of our medical devices  patients  hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products  diminishing our product sales 
successful commercialization of our products may depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party health care payers  such as private insurance plans and the government 
there can be no assurance that such reimbursement will be available 
we plan to conduct outcome studies for reimbursement  however  reimbursement may not be available in a sufficient time frame 
third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic and diagnostic products 
adequate levels of reimbursement may not be available to enable us to achieve market acceptance of the glucowatch biographer or other new products under development or to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment 
in the united states and foreign countries  the period of time needed to obtain such reimbursement can be lengthy 
we may delay the launch of our products in some countries until we have established our eligibility for reimbursement 
this delay could potentially harm our business 
we depend on third party suppliers 
any interruption in the supply of system components or the pricing of these components could prevent us from manufacturing our products 
the glucowatch biographer is manufactured from components purchased from outside suppliers  most of whom are our single source for such components 
in the event that we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain these components from our suppliers or that the components obtained from these suppliers do not pass quality standards  we will be required to obtain the components from alternative suppliers 
additionally  in the event a current supplier is unable to meet our component requirements  we might not be able to rapidly find another supplier of the particular component or an alternative supply at the same price or lead time 
an interruption in the supply of the glucowatch biographer components or excessive pricing of these components could prevent us from manufacturing our products 
we depend on proprietary technology 
if we fail to obtain patent protection for our products  preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  we may not generate profits 
our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products  preserve our trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and abroad 
currently  many patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until issuance  and publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discovery by several months 
thus  we may not have been the first to file patent applications on our inventions or we may have infringed upon third party patents 
our patent applications may fail to issue any patents 
any patents that are issued may not provide competitive advantages for our products or may be challenged or circumvented by our competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  suppliers and consultants 
these agreements could be breached  and we might not have adequate remedies for any breach 
additionally  our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
any litigation  in the united states or abroad  as well as foreign opposition and or domestic interference proceedings  could result in substantial expenses to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
we may resort to litigation to enforce our patents or protect trade secrets or know how  as well as to defend against infringement charges 
a negative determination in such proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
we may be subject to product liability claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use some technologies in the future 
the design  development  manufacture and use of our medical products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
producers of medical products may face substantial liability for damages in the event of product failure or allegations that the product caused harm 
we currently maintain product liability insurance  but it is expensive and difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
we may become subject to product liability claims  our current insurance may not cover any claims  and adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms in the future 
we could be held liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage  and any claim or product recall could create significant adverse publicity 
the competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in northern california 
if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key scientific  technical  sales  marketing  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
we face intense competition for such personnel  and we may not be able to attract and retain these individuals 
we compete with numerous pharmaceutical and health care companies  as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive northern california business area 
the loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business 
our success will depend in large part on the continued services of our scientific  managerial and manufacturing personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel
