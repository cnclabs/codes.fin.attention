results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of our major customers in particular  could materially harm our results of operations 
results of operations for years ended august   and the following table summarizes certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development goodwill amortization expense acquisition costs restructuring and impairment costs operating income loss net interest income expense income loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss net sales our net sales have increased in each of the past several years  reflecting the growing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
for the year ended august   net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal net sales of billion in fiscal were greater than fiscal the sales growth in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to increased demand from our personal computer  notebook and consumer automotive business sectors in the first half of fiscal  and our acquisitions during fiscal the sales growth in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to new program ramp ups  strong demand from our customers worldwide and acquisitions made during fiscal we are organized in three industry segments global manufacturing business unit  technology solutions business unit  and global services business unit 
our core business group  global manufacturing business unit  provided   and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our technology solutions business unt  consisting of smart  force and our recent acquisition of centennial  contributed  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and our global services business unit  contributed  and of net sales  respectively  in fiscal  and global manufacturing business unit fiscal year net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal year this increase was due to higher demand growth from our customers during the first half of fiscal and the acquisitions of nel and shinei as well as two sony manufacturing plants during fiscal year fiscal year net sales grew to billion  an increase of over fiscal the increase was primarily due to strong demand growth from our customers and to acquisitions  including alcatel s telecommunications manufacturing business in liverpool  australia  by our subsidiary bluegum  ibm ecat in austin  texas  trimble of california  ibm s netfinity server operations in greenock  scotland  ericsson s telecommunications infrastructure equipment operations in longuenesse  france  and ostersund  sweden  and zhone technologies of california  as well as our acquisition of alcatel s manufacturing business in aguadilla  puerto rico 
within the americas  net sales increased to billion  a increase in fiscal over the milpitas site in california  guadalajara site in mexico and austin site in texas were the largest contributors to the sales increase 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to higher demand from our customers in the first half of fiscal and to our acquisition of nortel sites in north carolina  mexico and canada  partially offset by the decrease in customer demand in the second half of fiscal the increase in fiscal versus was primarily due to new programs from our customers and sales growth in the americas 
sales continued to grow in the milpitas site despite our strategic transfer of personal computer pcb programs and computer peripherals systems assembly programs to mexico and networking business to penang  malaysia 
in europe  net sales increased to billion  a increase in fiscal over fiscal the increase in net sales was principally due to higher demand in the first half of fiscal and acquisition of ericsson s manufacturing assets in ostersund  sweden during the third quarter of fiscal our france and ostersund sites were the largest contributors to the sales increase in the region 
net sales stayed relatively flat in fiscal versus fiscal in asia pacific  net sales grew to billion  an increase in fiscal over fiscal the increase over the prior year was primarily due to demand growth from our customers in the first half of fiscal and acquisitions during fiscal  as well as the transfer of networking business from our milpitas site to our penang site in malaysia 
our penang site and suzhou site as well as former nel and shinei sites from our acquisitions during fiscal were the major contributors to the increase 
net sales growth in fiscal was primarily due to demand growth in mobile phone  networking and personal computer projects 
in particular  sales growth in the penang site was attributable to the growth of networking business 
in addition  our subsidiary bluegum s acquisition of alcatel s telecommunications manufacturing operations in liverpool  australia  also contributed to our sales increase in the region 
technology solutions business unit our technology solutions business unit consists of smart  force  and newly acquired centennial 
our main products in the technology solutions group are specialty and standard memory products  pc cards  embedded computer modules and communications card products 
net sales for fiscal years  and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal of from fiscal was principally due to decrease in demand and declines in average selling prices of memory components partially offset by the acquisition of centennial 
the increase in fiscal of over fiscal resulted from an overall increase in standard memory products incorporated with average memory densities  as well as an increase in embedded computer modules and communications card products 
global services business unit our global services business unit was established through three business acquisitions  sequel  nulogix and americom  as well as a small division of solectron in milpitas 
net sales were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was primarily due to stronger customer demand  acquisitions of nortel assets and bluegum group during fiscal  and acquisitions of ibm netherlands service facilities as well as mcc sequel during fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to higher customer demand and the acquisition of americom 
international sites net sales from our international sites  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  have grown over the last three fiscal years 
international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of our international sales and facilities  our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
while these dynamics have not materially harmed our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact in the future 
major customers only four major customers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  and  as summarized in the following table 
years ended august  cisco compaq ericsson nortel our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we depend on continued revenues from ericsson  compaq  cisco  nortel and our other top ten customers 
we cannot predict whether these or any other customers will increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm solectron s results of operations 
we believe that our ability to continue growing depends on increasing sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successfully marketing to new customers and expanding geographically 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  we cannot assure that our current customers will continue to utilize our services 
because of these factors  we cannot assure that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
gross profit our gross margin percentages were  and respectively  for fiscal  and the decrease in gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to under absorbed fixed costs that could not be taken out immediately in response to the decline in our customers end market demand 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we began to experience manufacturing inefficiencies due to higher than normal costs associated with the additional manpower required in the materials management area and under utilization of capacity which occurred later in the second quarter 
our gross margin was also affected by inefficiencies associated with restructuring 
we are shifting capacity to low cost locations  and programs are being transferred at an accelerated pace 
those transfer costs are accounted for as operational costs versus restructuring costs  consequently they affected our margins 
the decrease in fiscal over fiscal was attributed primarily to sales derived from lower margin mobile telecommunication equipment  manufacturing inefficiencies due to non linearity of material receipts  a high level of business development activities and new site integration support expenditures  as well as capacity ramp up for future demand growth 
our start up operations also contributed to the decrease 
in addition  the amortization of intellectual property resulting from certain acquisitions reduced gross margins 
for our global manufacturing business unit  we anticipate a larger percentage of our sales may be derived from systems build projects that generally yield lower profit margins than pcb assembly 
we expect most of our technology solutions sales may continue to be derived from turn key projects  which typically yield lower profit margins than consignment projects 
in addition  factors affecting technology solutions profit margins include the sales mix of specialty memory modules  standard memory modules  communication card products and embedded computer modules  as well as changes in average memory densities used in memory products 
in the foreseeable future  our overall gross margin will depend primarily on several factors  including but not limited to  product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  percentage of sales derived from systems build and turn key projects  pricing within the electronics industry  component costs and delivery linearity  and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for solectron as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
increases in the systems build business or turn key projects  additional costs associated with new projects  and price erosion within the electronics industry could harm our gross margin 
in addition  we have experienced component shortages 
while the component availability fluctuates from time to time and is subject to lead time and other constraints  this could possibly have a negative impact on our sales and gross margins for the foreseeable future 
therefore  we cannot assure that our gross margin will not fluctuate or decrease in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal over fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were due to higher human resource costs  information systems cost  and higher sg a resulting from our acquisitions of nel  centennial  mcc sequel  shinei and two sony manufacturing facilities 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to was caused by an increase in head count and information systems costs to support our sales growth and increased costs of acquisition related activities 
the primary reasons for the decrease in fiscal over in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales were the significant increase in sales volume and our continued effort to manage operating expenses  partially offset by the costs associated with investments in our business infrastructure  information systems and start up costs for new sites 
we anticipate sg a expenses will continue to increase in terms of absolute dollars in the future as we continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to support our current and prospective business 
research and development expenses with the exception of our technology solutions business unit  our research and development r d activities have been primarily developing prototype and engineering design capabilities  developing common tools for electrical  mechanical design  standardizing a single functional test platform  developing methods for handling  processing and re flow of high i o ball grid array  high reliability environmental stress test technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes such as lead free and no clean 
technology solutions r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and the use of microprocessors in embedded applications 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal over fiscal as a percentage of net sales  r d expense was of net sales for fiscal  and the increases in absolute dollars in r d expenses in fiscal and  were primarily due to our increased r d effort in smart and force and new r d projects initiated at our various sites 
we expect that r d expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as smart and force continue to invest in their r d efforts and additional r d projects are undertaken at certain sites 
goodwill amortization expense the goodwill amortization expense of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the nel acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased all of the outstanding issued share capital and convertible bonds of nel for approximately billion and million  respectively 
the nel acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method and  as a result  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill 
goodwill is amortized in equal annual amounts over a ten year period 
acquisition costs during fiscal  we recorded million in acquisition and integration costs  which were primarily related to the nel acquisition 
a charge for acquisition costs of million was incurred in fiscal as a result of the acquisitions of smart  americom and bluegum during fiscal our acquisition costs consist of investment banker fees  legal fees  accounting fees  registration fees and other direct costs 
restructuring and impairment costs the current fiscal year restructuring and impairment charge was taken in connection with our plan to review our operations in light of the current economic downturn and our plan to undertake several measures to restructure the company 
the measures  which included reducing the workforce  consolidating certain facilities and changing the strategic focus of a number of sites  were largely intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand as well as rationalize our footprint worldwide 
during fiscal and primarily in the third and fourth quarters  total restructuring and impairment costs of million were charged against earnings 
these restructuring and impairment charges included employee severance and benefit costs of approximately million  costs related to facilities that will be abandoned and subleased of approximately million  costs related to equipment that will be abandoned of approximately million  impairment of equipment of approximately million  impairment of facilities of approximately million  impairment of goodwill  intangible and other assets related to closed facilities of approximately million and other exit costs of approximately million 
the employee severance and benefit costs related to the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide 
approximately of the positions eliminated were in the americas region  were in europe and were in asia pacific 
the employment reductions primarily affected employees in manufacturing and back office support functions 
facilities and equipment subject to restructuring were primarily located in the americas and europe 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the lease costs represent future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less estimated sublease income 
for facilities and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the fair value less costs to sell  with fair value based on estimates of existing market prices for similar assets 
as of august   all  employees have left solectron under this plan 
we recorded restructuring costs of approximately million in fiscal primarily related to the consolidations of certain facilities acquired in the smart and sequel mergers 
approximately million related to lease exit costs  million related to asset write offs and other incidental costs  million related to severance costs and million related to other costs 
net interest income expense net interest expense was million in fiscal compared to net interest income of million in fiscal  and compared to net interest expense of million in fiscal the net interest expense in fiscal primarily resulted from our yield zero coupon convertible senior notes  and yield zero coupon convertible senior notes and senior notes  partially offset by interest income earned on deployed cash and investments 
the net interest income in fiscal was attributed primarily to interest income earned on cash and investments from the proceeds of the zero coupon convertible senior notes which were issued in may  offset partially with interest expense on the and yield zero coupon convertible senior notes as well as on the senior notes 
the net interest expense in fiscal was related to interest expenses from the yield zero coupon convertible senior notes and the convertible subordinated notes 
income taxes we reported income tax benefit of million in fiscal arising from the loss incurred in the period 
income tax expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal our effective income tax benefit rate was in fiscal our effective income tax expense rate was in fiscal and in fiscal our benefit rate was lower than our expense rate in prior years because we did not recognize some of the income tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 
in general  the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and international operations 
our international operations  taken as a whole  have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to several of solectron s overseas sites in malaysia  singapore  and china 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through july  subject to some conditions  including certain levels of research and development expenditures 
in addition  solectron has also been granted a tax holiday for certain operations in singapore which is effective through march  subject to certain conditions 
solectron has also been granted various tax holidays in china  which are effective for various terms and are subject to certain conditions 
liquidity and capital resources our net working capital was billion at august  compared to billion at august  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were billion at august   an increase of billion from august  the increase was primarily due to proceeds of approximately billion from yield zero coupon convertible senior debt issued in november and the issuance of million shares of common stock for approximately billion  as well as the inventory reduction of million  partially offset by investing activities  including the acquisition of nel s shares and convertible bonds for approximately billion  and capital expenditures of million 
accounts receivable increased million during fiscal  inventories decreased million in the same period 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from our sales growth and the acquisitions of nel  centennial  shinei and mcc sequel 
the decrease in inventory level was primarily due to our customers taking back excess inventory and by our return to normal just in time inventory management practices 
in addition  we worked with our customers and suppliers to revise the terms and conditions under which we procure and return parts 
those changes will help mitigate inventory imbalances in the future 
we continuously manage our inventory levels striving to maintain competitive lead times while balancing the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
as of august   we had available a million unsecured multicurrency revolving line of credit that expires on april  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the bank s prime rate  the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin  or the bank s certificate of deposit cd rate plus a margin 
the margin under the libor or cd rate options will vary depending on our standard poor s corporation and or moody s investor services  inc rating for our long term senior unsecured debt 
this margin was at august  under the credit agreement  we must meet certain financial covenants 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit as of august  in addition  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in committed and uncommitted foreign lines of credit and other bank facilities as of august  borrowings were payable on demand 
the interest rates ranged from the bank s prime lending rate to the bank s prime rate plus 
as of august   borrowings and guaranteed amounts under committed and uncommitted foreign lines of credit were million and million  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate was for committed and for uncommitted foreign lines of credit 
under these lines of credit agreements  we must meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all of the line of credit financial covenants as of august  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  line of credit  and cash generated from operations coupled with the anticipated proceeds from any offerings under our recently filed shelf registration statements will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure  and investment requirements through at least the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts and borrowings to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
in addition  we periodically hedge variability in cash flows resulting from fluctuating interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  maturing on june   to hedge against varying rental payments associated with an operating lease that requires payments based on libor 
this swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge upon adoption of the standard and the ineffective portion of the hedge was not significant 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of this interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into rent expense during the period in which the libor based lease agreement affects earnings 
since adoption  the impact to the financial statements has not been significant 
in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  sfas no 
also specifies the criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated lives to their estimated residual values  and be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  will continue to be amortized prior to adoption of sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we are accounting for all business combinations initiated or completed after june  using the purchase method of accounting 
we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
effective september  sfas no 
requires  upon adoption of sfas no 
 that we evaluate our existing intangibles assets and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas no 
for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we are required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and to make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption 
we are required to test the intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
within the first interim period 
any impairment loss is measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first interim period 
in connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  sfas no 
requires us to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we must identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assessing the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
the regulation allows up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
this second step is required to be completed as soon as possible  but no later than the end of the year of adoption 
any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations 
as of september   we had unamortized goodwill of billion  unamortized identifiable intangible assets of approximately million  all of which are subject to the transition provisions of sfas no 
and amortization expense related to goodwill was million for fiscal because of the extensive effort required to comply with the remaining provisions of sfas nos 
and  it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the impact on our financial statements of these provisions beyond discontinuing amortization 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  in august  and sfas no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in october sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which it incurs the obligation 
sfas no 
services to clarify and further define the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
does not apply to goodwill and other intangible assets that are not amortized 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect to adopt both effective september  the effect of the adopting these statements is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recent developments on july   we announced the filing of a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended 
we may  from time to time  offer our debt securities  shares of our common stock and preferred stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and guarantees of preferred securities  which together have an aggregate initial public offering price of up to billion 
the securities may be offered  separately or together  in separate series  in amounts  at prices and on terms to be set forth in the prospectus contained in the registration statement  and in one or more supplements to that prospectus  and may only be offered pursuant thereto 
on june   our board of directors approved the adoption of a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock  par value of per share  held by stockholders of record at the close of business on july  on august   we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement under which solectron and c mac will combine to create a diversified designer and manufacturer of integrated electronic manufacturing solutions 
the combination with c mac is expected to enhance solectron s systems solution offerings and expand its portfolio 
under the terms of the agreement  solectron will issue shares of solectron common stock in exchange for each c mac common share outstanding 
as of the announcement date  the transaction was valued at approximately billion 
the transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method 
the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar the arrangement is subject to merger notification requirements pursuant to the antitrust laws of the united states  canada  the european union and brazil and subject to review under the investment canada act 
as of october   we had received regulatory antitrust approval from the united states  canada  the european union and brazil 
the approval under the investment canada act was still pending 
on september   our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program 
under the program  we may repurchase our common shares in the open market beginning the first day that the new york stock exchange resumed 
as of october   we had purchased  shares  approximately  million under this program 
on october   we announced that we completed our acquisition of iphotonics  inc  a provider of core optical manufacturing services 
the acquisition increases our optical services capabilities  and enhances our total systems solutions offering 
on october   we announced that we completed our acquisition of stream international inc  a global customer relationship management outsourcing and support services provider for leading technology companies 
the acquisition increases the capabilities of solectron s global services business unit and enhances our total service offerings 
at various dates through october   solectron repurchased certain zero coupon convertible senior notes due  with face value of million  and a fair value of million 
risk factors we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  our sales have declined in the second half of fiscal compared to the first half of fiscal in particular  sales to oems in the telecommunications  workstation and server equipment manufacturing industry worldwide were impacted during the second half of fiscal if the economic conditions in the united states worsen we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have significant debt leverage and debt service obligations  if we are unable to service these debt obligations  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for fiscal was x as compared to x for fiscal this decline in the ratio is primarily due to interest expense growing at a greater rate than income during fiscal the degree to which we may be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness  as well as future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing  that any such financing would be on favorable terms  or that we will be permitted to do so under the terms of our existing financing arrangements  or our financing arrangements in effect in the future 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to experience adverse operating results or to fund required capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements may be adversely affected 
most of our net sales comes from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
most of our annual net sales comes from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales in fiscal and approximately and  of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
since we are dependent upon continued net sales from our ten largest customers  any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly 
some of these customers individually account for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our ten largest customers or any other accounts 
in addition  our customers may materially reduce the level of services ordered from us at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
moreover  our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend in significant part on our ability to obtain orders from new customers  as well as on the financial condition and success of our customers 
therefore  any adverse factors affecting any of our customers or their customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our long term contracts do not include minimum purchase requirements 
although we have long term contracts with a few of our top ten customers  including ericsson  ibm and nortel under which these customers are obligated to obtain services from us  only nortel is obligated to purchase any minimum amount of services 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will receive any net sales from these contracts 
in addition  these customers with whom we have long term contracts may materially reduce the level of services ordered at any time 
this could cause a significant decline in our net sales  and we may not be able to reduce our accompanying expenses at the same time 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter could affect the market price of our securities 
our quarterly earnings may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  high velocity and low complexity pcb and systems assembly services have lower gross margins than low volume complex pcb and systems assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies  depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production needs  fluctuations in demand for our services or the products being manufactured  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of components  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our target markets  and expenses associated with acquisitions 
therefore  our operating results in the future could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock could be harmed 
we depend upon the electronics industry  which continually produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles  our inability to continually manufacture such products in a cost effective manner would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our net sales are to companies in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment  our customers products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could decline significantly 
if we are unable to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response manufacturing services to customers  demand for our services will also decline 
in addition  a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from our ability to offer complete service solutions for our customers 
for example  if we fail to maintain high quality design and engineering services  our net sales would significantly decline 
for our technology solutions business  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays from time to time in the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancements 
we cannot assure that defects or errors will not be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments  which could result in the delay in market acceptance of such products 
the inability to introduce new products or enhancements could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on a limited or sole source of suppliers for critical components 
the inability to obtain sufficient components as required would cause harm to our business 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components used in our products 
we have experienced and may continue to experience delays in component deliveries  which could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products 
also for our technology solutions business  we are dependent upon certain limited or sole source suppliers for critical components used for our memory module  communications card and embedded computer products 
the electronics industry has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages in semiconductor devices  including dram  sram  flash memory  tantalum capacitors and other commodities that may be caused by such conditions as overall market demand surges or supplier production capacity constraints 
except for certain commodity parts  we generally have no written agreements with our suppliers 
we cannot give any assurance that we will receive adequate component supplies on a timely basis in the future 
the inability to continue to obtain sufficient components as required  or to develop alternative sources as required  could cause delays  disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  thereby causing harm to our business 
we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with potential shortages in the availability of electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components because we are unable to purchase components at the pricing level anticipated to support the margins assumed in our agreements with our customers 
our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations 
the memory module  communications card and embedded computer subsystem industries are also intensely competitive 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide 
our inability to provide comparable or better manufacturing services at a lower cost than our competitors could cause our net sales to decline 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services  or profit margin compression 
we depend on the memory module product market 
most of our technology solutions net sales is derived from memory modular products 
the market for these products is characterized by frequent transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards 
a failure to develop products with required feature sets or performance standards or a delay as short as a few months in bringing a new product to market could reduce our net sales which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the market for semiconductor memory devices has been cyclical 
the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and excess production 
in the past  there have been significant declines in the prices for dram  sram and flash memory 
similar occurrences will reduce our profit 
we depend on the continuing trend of oems to outsouce 
a substantial factor in our revenue growth is attributable to the transfer of manufacturing and supply base management activities from our oem customers 
future growth is partially dependent on new outsourcing opportunities 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  our future growth would be unfavorably impacted 
these outsourcing opportunities may include the transfer of assets such as facilities  equipment and inventory 
if we are unable to manage our rapid growth and cost effectively assimilate new operations  our profitability could decline 
we have experienced rapid growth over many years 
our historical growth may not continue 
in recent years we have established operations in different locations throughout the world 
for example  in fiscal  we opened offices in taipei  taiwan  tel aviv  israel  norrkoping and stockholm  sweden  and commenced manufacturing operations in guadalajara  mexico  suzhou  china  and timisoara  romania 
also in fiscal  we acquired foreign facilities in sao paulo  brazil and dublin  ireland 
furthermore  through acquisitions in fiscal and  we acquired facilities in duluth  georgia  columbia  south carolina  memphis  tennessee  and enhanced our capabilities in charlotte  north carolina  austin  texas  and milpitas  california 
in fiscal  we completed acquisitions of americom  smart  and bluegum 
through additional acquisitions  we also acquired foreign facilities in aguadilla  puerto rico  monterrey  mexico  calgary  canada  longuenesse  france  ostersund  sweden  cwmcarn  wales  pont de buis and douarnenez  france  monkstown  northern ireland  liverpool  new south wales  wangaratta and melbourne  victoria  and sydney and north melbourne  australia 
during fiscal  we completed acquisitions of nel  shinei  centennial  mcc sequel  and sony s manufacturing facilities in japan and taiwan as well as ibm s repair center in the netherlands 
our expansion and growth places a heavy strain on our personnel and management  manufacturing and other resources 
our ability to manage the expansion to date  as well as any future expansion  will require progressive increases in manufacturing infrastructure  as well as enhancements or upgrades of accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation of a variety of procedures and controls 
we cannot assure that significant problems in these areas will not occur 
any failure to enhance or expand these systems and implement such procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
also  in order to achieve anticipated revenue and other financial performance targets  we must manage our assets and operations efficiently 
in addition  should we continue to expand geographically  we may experience certain inefficiencies from the management of geographically dispersed facilities 
as we manage and continue to expand new operations  we may incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
if we do not achieve sufficient growth to offset increased expenses associated with rapid expansion  our profitability will decline 
the acquisition of c mac may not occur on august   we announced that we and c mac signed a definitive agreement under which we and c mac will combine to create a diversified designer and manufacturer of integrated electronic manufacturing solutions 
the transaction is expected to be completed by the end of calendar the arrangement is subject to merger notification requirements pursuant to the antitrust laws of the united states  canada  the european union and brazil and subject to review and approval under the investment canada act 
the arrangement may be subject to additional foreign antitrust laws to be determined 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary approval 
the combined company may be required to agree to various operating restrictions or other conditions  before or after receipt of shareholder approvals in order to obtain the necessary approvals of the arrangement under canada s investment review laws 
no additional shareholder approval is expected to be required or sought for any decision by solectron or c mac  after the c mac and solectron special meetings which are both scheduled for november   to agree to any terms and conditions necessary to resolve any foreign regulatory objections to the transaction  and shareholder approval will not be sought unless such shareholder approval is required to approve such terms and conditions under applicable foreign law 
operating restrictions or other conditions required to secure regulatory approval may include the imposition of a material limitation on the ability of any of these parties to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets  properties and stock 
any of these operating restrictions or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to economically operate the combined company 
in addition to regulatory approvals  the proposed arrangement under the canada business corporations act requires approval by the superior court of justice qu bec 
prior to the filing of this document  c mac obtained an interim order providing for the calling and holding of the c mac special meeting and other procedural matters 
subject to the approval of the c mac arrangement resolution at the c mac meeting and the approval of the solectron shares issuance at the solectron special meeting  we may not be able to obtain the approval from our shareholders 
we need to successfully integrate our acquisitions to maintain profitability 
as we expand our operations through acquisitions and continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and may pursue additional acquisitions over time 
these acquisitions involve risks  including integration and management of the operations  retention of key personnel  integration of purchasing operations and information systems  retention of the customer base of acquired businesses  management of an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business  and diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
our profitability will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate and manage recent acquisitions and pending acquisitions including  in particular  the nel  shinei  mcc sequel  centennial  and c mac transactions  as well as any future acquisitions that we might pursue  or if we do not achieve sufficient revenue to offset the increased expenses associated with these acquisitions 
our non us locations represent a significant and growing portion of our net sales  we are increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
in fiscal  approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states  while approximately of net sales came from sites outside the united states in fiscal as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  and the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws 
in addition  we have operations in several locations in emerging or developing economies that have a potential for higher risk 
the risks associated with these economies include but are not limited to currency volatility  and other economic or political risks 
in the future  these factors may harm our results of operations 
solectron locations in emerging or developing economies include mexico  brazil  china  malaysia  hungary and romania 
as of august   we recorded million in cumulative foreign exchange translation losses on our balance sheet which was primarily due to the devaluation of the brazilian real 
while  to date  these factors have not had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  we cannot give any assurance that there will not be such an impact 
furthermore  while we may adopt measures to reduce the impact of losses resulting from volatile currencies and other risks of doing business abroad  we cannot assure that such measures will be adequate 
the malaysian government adopted currency exchange controls  including controls on its currency  the ringgit  held outside malaysia  and established a fixed exchange rate for the ringgit against the us dollar 
the fixed exchange rate provides a stable rate environment when applied to local expenses denominated in ringgit 
the long term impact of such controls is not predictable due to dynamic economic conditions that also affect or are affected by other regional or global economies 
we have been granted a tax holiday which is effective through  subject to some conditions  for our malaysian and singapore sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that we may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future  our effective income tax rate would likely increase 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that substantially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
presently  we use foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
as of august   the majority of the foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in less than three months and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  including our current experience involving the devaluation of the brazilian real  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
also  since less than of our net sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than us dollar  we do not believe our total exposure to be significant 
we have currency exposures arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our sites 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the currency of the exposure and the functional currency of our site could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time  maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august   approximately of our total portfolio is scheduled to mature in less than six months 
in addition  our investments are diversified and of relatively short maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our investment portfolios 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by calendar year of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of august total fair value amounts in millions cash equivalents and short term investments average interest rate we have entered into an interest rate swap transaction under which we pay a fixed rate of interest hedging against the variable interest rates implicit in the rent charged by the lessor for the facility lease at milpitas  california 
the interest rate swap expires june   which coincides with the maturity date of the lease term 
as we intend to hold the interest rate swap until the maturity date  we are not subject to market risk 
in substance  such interest rate swap has fixed the interest rate for the facility lease  thus reducing interest rate risk 
our long term debt instruments are subject to fixed interest rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
in the case of the convertible notes  such notes are based on fixed conversion ratios into common stock 
therefore  we are not exposed to variable interest rates related to our long term debt instruments 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  and we could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents and other license rights 
these patent and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations 
in the future  third parties may assert infringement claims against us or our customers 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative or to obtain licenses 
we may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our financial condition 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of non compliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
our administrative facilities and principal business operations are located in california  and any distruption in the available power supply in california could disrupt our operations  reduce our revenues  and increase our expense 
a substantial portion of our operating activities and facilities  including our headquarters and principal administrative facilities  as well as certain of our third party service providers are located in california 
during acute power shortages  california has implemented  and may in the future continue to implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
the rolling blackouts that have occurred to date have not materially disrupted the operations of our facilities 
should these blackouts continue or increase in severity  however  they could materially disrupt the operations of one or more of our facilities 
although solectron currently does not have backup generator or long term alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  solectron does have some flexibility to shift some manufacturing volume to other manufacturing sites around the world 
if blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our affected facilities 
our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages our customers or we may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
consequently  any interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which would substantially harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  the utility deregulation program instituted in by the california government deregulated wholesale prices while continuing to regulate the retail prices charged by the electrical utilities 
while wholesale prices have increased dramatically  retail prices have  until recently  not increased at a comparable rate 
our business is substantially dependent on the availability and price of electricity 
if retail electricity prices rise dramatically  we would expect our expenses to increase  our operating results to be harmed  and the possible decline of our stock price 
our stock price may be volatile due to factors outside of our control 
our stock price could fluctuate due to the following factors  among others announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
our low stock price may reduce our diluted earnings per share 
on january   we may become obligated to purchase  at the option of the holders  all or a portion of the outstanding lyons at a price of per note purchase price 
we have the option to pay the purchase price of lyons in cash or common stock or any combination thereof 
if we elect to pay the purchase price  in whole or part  in shares of our common stock  the number of shares of common stock to be delivered shall equal the purchase price divided by the average of the sale prices of the common stock for the five trading day period ending on the third business day prior to january  the lyons are convertible into common stock at a price of per share or shares per lyon 
in the event that our stock price remains below per share at january   we may have to issue additional shares to the holders 
accordingly  our earnings per share may be reduced 
failure to retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our operations 
our anti takeover defense provisions may deter potential acquirors and may depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of solectron 
these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock and impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for our stockholders to effect certain corporate actions item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for factors related to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency and fluctuations in interest rates under risk factors
