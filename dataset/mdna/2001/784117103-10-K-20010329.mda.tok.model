revenues increased percent and earnings increased percent during there are three primary factors underlying our recent growth in revenues and earnings first  increased market acceptance of our products and services  second  leverage in our operations  and third  our portfolio of businesses 
our products and services have been adopted by many companies  institutions  and intermediaries 
net asset flow into our funds from high net worth and institutional investors increased billion during despite the recent volatility experienced in the capital markets 
sales to new clients and the delivery of new products and services to existing clients in our technology and outsourcing businesses increased during  especially in the later half of the year 
our mutual fund outsourcing services are showing early signs of acceptance in new target markets of alternative investment managers and offshore fund sponsors 
we are also achieving economies of scale in most of our back office and investment management operations as well as having many shared technology development projects 
our margins before taxes and interest increased to percent during compared to the percent realized during during the past few years  our asset management business has been the primary driver in revenues and earnings growth 
during the later half of when the capital markets were unstable  our technology business supported our growth 
we believe this diverse range of markets we serve with our many products and services gives us some stability during times of short term business volatility 
we intend to sustain revenues and earnings growth by delivering new products and services to our existing clients and maintaining a level of new sales 
in addition  we will effectively utilize our current infrastructure to manage expenses across a high net incremental revenue base 
however  mergers and acquisitions within the banking industry and any prolonged volatility in the capital markets could negate any expected growth in revenues and earnings

assets under administration consist of total assets for which we provide management and administration services  including client proprietary fund balances for which we provide administration and or distribution services 
technology services technology services provides trust technology outsourcing services to banks and other financial institutions through our trust product line 
trust includes many integrated products and sub systems that provide a complete investment accounting and management information system for trust institutions 
revenues are earned from monthly processing and software services fees  and project fees associated with the conversion of new and merging clients 
trust operations outsourcing incorporates the trust product line within a package of services that includes investment management  custody and other back office capabilities 
through this business  we handle a trust department s back office administration function 
revenues are earned from processing and management fees 
dollar percent change change revenues trust technology services    trust operations outsourcing    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing   total operating profits    profit margin trust technology services revenues increased largely due to increased sales activity in our core service bureau business 
new sales in our core service bureau business during the past two years has primarily been driven by new clients and mergers in the large bank segment 
we are also beginning to see increased interest from the regional bank segment 
we recently signed four new clients from this segment that will generate over million in future recurring revenues 
sales of new products and services to existing clients  has also contributed significantly to our recent growth in revenues 
many of our new products have received strong acceptance from our existing clients  because of our commitment to providing new services and improving existing services to our clients 
we believe this stems from our extensive technology development agenda  and our ability to provide business solutions beyond software and processing 
new sales and cross sales contributed approximately million in additional recurring processing fees for finally  brokerage services provided a significant revenue boost in brokerage services allow a client to execute equity trades through sei s captive broker dealer 
trust operations outsourcing revenues increased primarily due to an increase in assets under management that generated an additional million in investment management fees from our outsourcing clients 
the increase in assets under management was due to new sales activity and increased asset flow into our funds from existing clients 
processing fees remained relatively flat during operating profits and profit margin for technology services increased substantially during the increase in operating profits and profit margin were primarily due to the increase in revenues previously discussed and the leveragability inherent in our current infrastructure 
achieving real economies of scale in our operational groups provides us with the ability to maintain strong investment levels without hurting margins significantly 
we believe these investments are critical to our long term growth potential 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses remained the same at percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased to percent from percent 
our sales strategy in the short term will remain focused on our core service bureau business and back office outsourcing opportunities 
for the intermediate and long term  our sales strategy will be expanded to include global asset managers  especially in europe 
we will also be delivering new products to our existing clients that are expected to fuel our near term growth 
in addition  we will continue to maintain a high level of investment in this business to take advantage of growth opportunities in the u 
s and europe 
specifically  investments will be made in globalizing trust and in the development of sales and service infrastructure in europe 
we are also focusing additional marketing and sales efforts towards other investment management financial services companies who are beginning to compete for high net worth investment management clients by offering trust services 
finally  we are constantly monitoring mergers and acquisitions within the banking industry that may affect our bank clients 
today  this remains as the major strategic issue facing this segment that could impact future growth 
asset management the asset management segment provides investment solutions through various investment products and services distributed directly or through professional investment advisors  financial planners  and other financial intermediaries to institutional or high net worth markets 
the primary products offered include diversified investment strategies and portfolios and back office technology support 
revenues are earned through management fees that are based upon a fixed percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of assets under management 
dollar percent change change revenues investment management fees    liquidity management fees    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits    profit margin investment management fees increased percent primarily due to an increase in average assets under management driven by new sales in both our investment advisory and institutional asset management businesses 
average assets under management increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during in our investment advisory business  we added approximately  new registered investment advisors to our network during  bringing this total to about  in our institutional asset management business  we established new client relationships during  of which ten new clients funded over million each 
some of these new clients included defined benefit plans  defined contribution plans  endowments and foundations and unions  which are new markets we have recently targeted 
the increase in new sales in both businesses is the result of a growing interest and acceptance of our outsource business solution across a diverse range of clients 
the increase in liquidity management fees is directly related to assets under management  which increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during investor strategies seem to have been affected by the recent market volatility to move out of fixed income and equity securities and into short term liquid assets 
operating profits and profit margin increased substantially during due to the substantial increase in revenues and the leveragability built into our operations 
we have been able to control operating costs and continue to make investments in developing new products without substantially affecting margins 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses remained flat at percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased to percent from percent 
despite the recent volatility of the marketplace  we remain optimistic about our future business 
we have a current backlog of almost billion of client assets  we will be launching several new investment programs during  and we will dedicate resources to expanding our services into new markets to further diversify this business 
we are confident that our sales and product strategy will continue to provide new business to support future growth 
however  continued volatility in the capital markets could have an effect on an investors investment strategy 
if investors move funds out of higher margin investment products and into lower margin investment products or out of the market altogether  revenues and margins would also be affected 
in addition  a significant devaluation in the capital markets would also affect revenues and margins 
mutual fund services mutual fund services provides administration and distribution services to proprietary mutual funds created by banks  insurance firms  and investment management companies 
these services include fund administration and accounting  legal and compliance services  shareholder recordkeeping  and marketing 
revenues are based upon a fixed percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of the proprietary funds 
dollar percent change change revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits    profit margin the increase in revenues was fueled by growth in average proprietary fund balances  which increased billion or percent to billion during compared to billion during most of the growth in revenues resulted from new sales  especially in the investment management  offshore and hedge fund markets 
additionally  we made progress in cross selling products to our existing clients  mainly brokerage services 
this growth reflects both the market acceptance of our business solutions and the product strategy that was instituted almost two years ago 
however  total revenues were negatively affected by a decrease in average basis points earned because of fee concessions extended to existing clients in exchange for longer term contracts and a reduction in the range of certain services to large bank clients 
profit margin remained flat in because expenses increased at the same rate as revenues 
expenses rose because of continued investment in new technology and accelerating sales and marketing efforts targeting the investment management and offshore markets 
as a percentage of sales  both operating and development and sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat 
the demand for our services in the investment management  offshore and hedge fund markets has steadily risen 
we will continue to focus our efforts in these markets because we believe these markets hold the greatest long term growth potential for our services 
the large bank market poses the most challenges because of significant changes during the past few years 
many of the largest banks with well established complexes have grown their mutual funds to the point where they are less reliant on the services of an outsourcer 
in addition  consolidations in the large bank market could negatively impact revenues 
we are repositioning services by emphasizing value added information and technology products in this market 
investments in new business investments in new business include of our global asset management initiatives that incorporate our investment products and services to provide investment solutions to institutional and high net worth investors outside the united states as well as other new business initiatives

early results of that refocusing have been optimistic 
we have received approximately million in new assets from canadian clients 
average assets under management from our canadian operations were billion during  as compared to million during although the pace of global asset gathering and revenue recognition continued to accelerate  we also accelerated the pace of our investment efforts  especially in the european region 
we have recently formed an investment team in london to support our global business  a marketing and service team in london to focus on the uk pension market  and a marketing and investment operation in france as part of our joint venture with hsbc ccf 
we will continue to focus sales efforts in canada and other countries as well

revenues and earnings from continuing operations reached a new record level in  primarily from new business in technology services and asset management 
technology services operating results reflect increases in recurring processing fees generated from new clients and the delivery of new products to our existing clients 
asset management operating results were boosted by significant increases in assets under management from new and existing clients in our investment advisory and institutional asset management businesses 
comparative results reflect an unusually large one time revenue event in  that was triggered by the acquisition of one of our largest technology clients that resulted in the recognition of a substantial contractual buyout fee

our trust operations outsourcing business continued to generate new business in revenues earned from processing services accounts for approximately percent of total trust operations outsourcing revenues in and percent in  while investment services comprise the remaining percent in and percent in this shift in revenues can be attributed to growth in assets from existing clients and an increase in sales for investment services in the community and regional bank markets 
operating profits and profit margin for technology services increased substantially during operating profits and profit margin in were inflated by the inclusion of the significant one time buyout fee previously discussed 
this one time event contributed approximately million to operating profits in excluding the effect of this one time event  operating profits actually increased percent 
the increase in operating profits and profit margin reflect increased system sales in the large bank market over the last few years and back office sales in the community bank market

we established approximately  new registered investment advisor relationships during  bringing our total network to almost  advisors 
we have also been working closely with our existing advisors to assist them in expanding their existing client base through the introduction of new investment options and programs

these new relationships included defined benefit plans  defined contribution plans  endowments and foundations 
the percent increase in liquidity management fees was mainly driven by an increase in average assets under management and increased sales of the cash sweep technology product 
average assets under management increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during we successfully recruited new cash sweep technology clients and new institutional clients during however  short term interest rate volatility slowed the use of money market funds during which dampened the growth in liquidity management fees 
operating profits and profit margin increased substantially during profit margin improvement resulted from two primary factors 
first  our ability to leverage on our existing infrastructure allowed us to increase revenues while controlling variable operating costs 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased to percent from percent 
second  we introduced new investment programs and initiatives to our existing clients 
this provided opportunities to generate additional revenues from our existing client base 
mutual fund services dollar percent change change revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing   total operating profits   profit margin the increase in revenues was fueled by growth in average proprietary fund balances  which increased billion or percent to billion during versus billion during average proprietary fund balances increased primarily due to growth in existing large bank complexes 
also  an increased presence in the non bank and offshore markets has yielded positive returns during a significant portion of the growth in average assets during can be attributed to non bank and offshore clients 
however  revenues were negatively affected by a decrease in average basis points earned because of fee concessions extended to existing clients in exchange for longer term contracts and a reduction in the range of certain services to large bank clients 
although revenues increased percent  operating profits and profit margin decreased in  primarily from reduced fees from large bank clients and from a significant increase in operating and development expenses 
as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses increased to percent from percent 
this increase reflects our critical investments to support our initiatives in the non bank and offshore markets and to develop new technology that will differentiate our services in an increasingly commoditized product area
