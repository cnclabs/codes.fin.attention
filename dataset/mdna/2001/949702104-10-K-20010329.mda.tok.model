item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of high quality polyester products  including fortrel brand polyester textile fibers  polyester fibers made from recycled raw materials  and permaclear brand pet resins 
at december   we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately billion pounds of fiber and billion pounds of pet resins worldwide at six major production facilities in the united states and europe 
see recent developments above and outlook below 
we are also the world s largest pet plastics recycler  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations 
beginning in the first quarter of  we reduced our reportable operating segments from three to two the fibers and recycled products group or frpg and the packaging products group or ppg 
in an effort to streamline costs and integrate our fiber operations  we changed our organizational structure so that both the chemical and recycled based fiber operations report to one individual 
we now report our financial information to our chief operating decision maker under these two segments 
the frpg produces fortrel textile fibers  which currently represent approximately of our fiber production 
these fibers are used in apparel  home furnishings  and non wovens and are produced from two chemical raw materials  purified terephthalic acid pta and monoethylene glycol meg 
the other of our fiber production  primarily fiberfill and carpet fibers  is manufactured from recycled raw materials  including post consumer pet containers  resin and film materials and post industrial materials 
our pet resins  produced by the ppg from pta and meg  are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical 
it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber and textile product imports 
since late  imports of products throughout the textile chain have impacted the united states fiber markets  adversely affecting profitability 
global pet resins demand continues to grow  driven by new product applications for pet and conversions from other packaging materials to pet 
our profitability is primarily determined by our raw material margins the difference between product selling prices and raw material costs 
both fiber and pet resin raw material margins increase or decrease as a result of supply and demand factors and competitive conditions 
given our substantial unit volumes  the impact on profitability of changes in raw material margins is significant 
selling prices and raw material costs each may be affected by actions of our competitors  global economic and market conditions  export and import activity  and the prices of competing materials 
seasonal factors  such as weather and the vacation and holiday closings of our facilities or those of our customers  may also affect our operations 
restructuring charges restructuring during the second quarter of  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan to improve long term profitability and stockholder returns 
we recorded a pretax restructuring charge totaling million million after tax or per diluted share 
pursuant to the plan  we closed our new york office and our wool business in johnsonville  sc during and began implementing other cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives throughout our businesses 
the restructuring  which was funded from operating cash flows  was completed in see note to the consolidated financial statements for changes in the accruals since the plan was adopted 
we expect our cost reduction and productivity improvement plan to generate planned annual pretax savings of approximately million 
these savings began to phase in during and continued in the savings associated with the cost reduction portion of the plan  expected to be approximately million annually compared to budgeted levels  primarily result from lower costs for services  supplies and wages 
the expected savings are net of other continuing costs  such as fixed overhead  that the businesses have to absorb as a result of the restructuring 
the productivity improvement portion of the plan is expected to generate earnings of approximately million as pet resin market conditions improve 
we will achieve the productivity improvements through increased production volumes and lower annual costs by means of throughput and manufacturing improvements and operational efficiencies in our production facilities 
we achieved cost reductions from the restructuring plan of approximately to million in restructuring in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to consolidate and lower the overall operating costs of the business units in the frpg 
in connection with this plan  we closed operations at a leased manufacturing facility in new jersey and a sales office in the united kingdom 
we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of the restructuring was completed during the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the accruals and changes in the accruals since december  production outages in august  we experienced production outages in our pet resin production process primarily resulting from an electrical failure 
in addition  in september we experienced reduced levels of production in our manufacturing facilities in the carolinas due to a hurricane 
total costs associated with these production outages were approximately million  of which million was recorded as an insurance receivable for property damages in the additional costs associated with these events increased the pretax loss for by approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  we settled the outstanding claim under our business interruption insurance policy relating to these outages and recorded income of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share 
these costs and the related income from business interruption insurance were reflected in cost of sales 
idle assets we completed the construction of our pearl river facility in this facility consists of two resin lines and one staple fiber line 
the resin lines were completed in they operated in with a higher production capacity than originally designed 
a portion of the staple fiber line commenced operation in the second quarter of this line operated at approximately one half of its capacity due to certain of its critical components not meeting specification 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of  we incurred additional expenses due to the inefficient operation of the staple fiber line 
by december  we remedied the mechanical problems 
however  we idled the staple fiber line because of the expected over supply of polyester staple fiber in the united states in the activities necessary to idle our pearl river staple fiber line increased costs in the fourth quarter 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million million after tax  or per diluted share  in december impact of euro our european operations have been impacted by the decline of the euro against the us dollar 
if the average exchange rate for were at the average exchange rate of euros to usd  our pretax earnings would have increased by approximately million 
stockholder s equity was reduced by currency translation adjustments of million in and million in results of operations compared to total net sales for increased to a record  million from million for this increase was primarily due to improved selling prices and increased volumes for the ppg 
net sales for the frpg increased to million in the period from million in the period  due to improved fiber selling prices from the prior period 
net sales for the ppg increased to million in the period from million in the period  reflecting significantly improved selling prices and increased volume from having a full year s production from the two pet resin lines at the pearl river facility that started up during the first half of cost of sales increased to million in from million in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for the period  compared to for the period 
during  our operations were negatively impacted by significantly higher raw material costs  higher energy costs primarily natural gas  costs associated with commencing the staple fiber operations at the pearl river facility  a charge relating to the activities necessary to idle the pearl river staple fiber production assets see above  and the impact of the euro see above 
the effect of these items was offset in part by income from business interruption insurance of million million after tax in  compared with an additional expense of million million after tax related to the production outages in  and cost savings associated with the restructuring 
see production outages and restructuring charges above 
frpg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in the period compared to the period 
this increase was primarily due to significantly higher raw material costs  energy costs and start up costs of the staple fiber line at the pearl river facility  which more than offset higher selling prices and improved results from our european fibers business 
ppg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased slightly in the period compared to the period  resulting primarily from significantly higher pet resin selling prices and higher unit volumes  offset in part by higher chemical raw material costs 
in addition  the prior period was affected by a production outage as discussed above 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in the period compared to in the period 
during the second quarter of  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan 
as a result  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge in our earnings of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
the restructuring was completed in the fourth quarter of in  we recognized restructuring income of million million after tax  or per diluted share  from over accruals 
see restructuring charges above and note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of sales  in the period compared to million  or of sales  in the period 
these expenses declined primarily as a result of our cost reduction and productivity improvement plan and savings associated with our closed facilities see restructuring charges above  offset in part by discounts taken on accounts receivable sold 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million for compared to million for excluding the restructuring charge benefit  the impact of increased costs due to the production outages in  the income from business interruption insurance in  and the charge relating to the activities necessary to idle the pearl river staple fiber production assets  operating income for was million compared to million for net interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was due to less interest being capitalized in relating to the construction in progress at the pearl river facility and higher interest rates  offset in part by a lower level of debt 
for information related to  see outlook below 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for the rate for decreased primarily as a result of improved earnings in our european operations that is taxed at a rate significantly lower than us rates 
effective january   we adopted the aicpa s statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of start up activities  which required us to begin expensing all start up and organization costs as incurred 
start up and organization costs incurred prior to the adoption of this sop were reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change increased our net loss for by million million  less taxes of million  or per diluted share 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for compared to total net sales for declined to million from million in this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in worldwide polyester fiber and pet resins selling prices and the reduced sales as a result of the businesses closed in the and restructurings 
net sales for the frpg decreased to million from million in  principally due to lower fiber selling prices from the previous period and significantly lower sales in our wool business see restructurings above 
polyester fiber unit volumes remained essentially unchanged in compared to net sales for the ppg increased to million in from million in due to a significant increase in pet resin unit volumes  reflecting the start up in the first half of of two new pet resin production lines 
the higher volumes more than offset the decline in the average selling price per pound of pet resin 
cost of sales increased to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to the start up of two pet resin production lines and the production outages 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased to in from in due to lower worldwide selling prices 
frpg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  primarily due to lower fiber selling prices  offset in part by lower us recycled raw material costs 
ppg s cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased slightly in compared to  resulting primarily from lower worldwide pet resins selling prices 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit declined to million in from million in the gross profit margin was in compared to in gross profit was primarily affected by raw material margins 
raw material margins for both fibers and pet resins dropped to historically low levels during  primarily due to reductions in selling prices occurring over the last few years 
the net cost of our chemical raw materials  pta and meg  increased during  primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices worldwide 
the selling price of chemical based fiber and pet resin could not be increased sufficiently to cover the raw material increase 
selling prices of recycled fiber declined more than the cost of domestic recycled fibers raw material and resulted in lower raw material margins for our domestic recycled fiber business 
in an effort to offset in part the effects of lower selling prices and higher raw material costs in both our frpg and ppg and to improve long term profitability and stockholder returns  we implemented an overall cost reduction and productivity improvement plan in june as a result  we recorded a pretax restructuring charge in of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
see restructuring charges above 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in this decrease was primarily due to lower spending associated with our closed facilities and our cost reduction and productivity improvement plan  offset in part by discounts taken on accounts receivable sold 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  we reported operating income of million  or 
of sales  for  compared to million  or of sales  in net interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to less capitalized interest in as we commenced operation of two of three production lines at our pearl river facility in mississippi 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a pretax charge of million on the termination of a fixed rate financial instrument 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for the difference in this rate was primarily due to the net loss in compared to net income in and the increase in the nondeductible goodwill in as a result of the write off of goodwill associated with the closure of our wool business 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the foregoing  in we reported a loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in of million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in excluding the production outages see production outages above  the restructuring charge see restructuring charges above  and the cumulative effect of accounting change  net earnings were million  or per diluted share 
this compared to million  or per diluted share  for  after excluding the restructuring charge  a lower of cost or market inventory adjustment and a loss on the fixed rate financial instrument 
outlook the following statements are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties below 
we expect our profitability in the first quarter to be lower than fourth quarter  primarily due to higher energy and meg costs  both of which are driven by higher natural gas costs 
we expect sales volumes of both fibers and pet resins in to be approximately the same as at approximately billion pounds each 
we announced a per pound selling price increase for domestic pet resins effective april  we expect the higher selling price for pet resins to result in higher margins and increased profitability in over however  given the competitive nature of our business and other market influences  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we expect global demand for pet resins to grow and capacity utilization to improve during the next several years 
even though the last announced domestic industry capacity expansion will increase capacity by approximately in the second half of  capacity utilization is expected to increase in over volume sales of ecoclear are expected to increase in as customers increase their demand for post consumer content pet resins 
in  final anti dumping duties  which are country and company specific  were imposed on imports of pet resins into europe 
we expect these duties to result in a decline of pet resins imports into europe 
the domestic fibers market has maintained relatively stable volumes but continues to be adversely impacted by imports throughout the textile chain 
anti dumping duties have been imposed on polyester fiberfill staple fiber imports from certain countries for a five year period 
this has modestly reduced staple fiber imports  but has had no effect on imports in the remainder of the textile chain 
we expect this situation to continue in the near future 
far eastern imports continue to be a significant factor 
the following are certain key financial estimates for depreciation and amortization to million interest expense to million capital expenditures to million tax rate to environmental matters our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste management activities 
we take a proactive approach in addressing the applicability of these laws and regulations as they relate to our manufacturing operations and in proposing and implementing any remedial plans that may be necessary 
we have identified certain situations that will require future capital and non capital expenditures to maintain or improve compliance with current environmental laws and regulations as well as to support planned future expansion 
the majority of the identified situations are found at our largest manufacturing facilities and primarily deal with groundwater remediation  quality of air emissions and wastewater treatment processes 
our policy is to expense environmental remediation costs when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
while it is often difficult to reasonably quantify future environmental related expenditures  we currently estimate our future non capital expenditures related to environmental matters to range between million and million 
in connection with these expenditures  we have accrued undiscounted liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are reflected as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
these accruals represent our best estimate of probable non capital environmental expenditures 
in addition  aggregate future capital expenditures related to environmental matters are expected to range from million to million 
these non capital and capital expenditures are expected to be incurred during the next to years 
we believe that we are entitled to recover a portion of these expenditures under indemnification and escrow agreements 
during  and  net expenses associated with environmental remediation and ongoing assessment were not significant 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we base the measurement of liability on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual situation and take into consideration factors such as existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
as assessments and remediation progress at individual sites  we review these liabilities periodically and adjust them to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available 
we believe we are either in material compliance with all currently applicable regulations or are operating in accordance with the appropriate variances and compliance schedules or similar arrangements 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we believe that compliance with current laws and regulations will not require significant capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties 
transition to the euro although the euro was successfully introduced on january   the legacy currencies of those countries participating will continue to be used as legal tender through january  thereafter  the legacy currencies will be cancelled and euro bills and coins will be used in participating countries 
transition to the euro creates a number of issues for us 
business issues that must be addressed include product pricing policies and ensuring the continuity of business and financial contracts 
finance and accounting issues include the conversion of accounting systems  statutory records  tax reports and payroll systems to the euro  as well as conversion of bank accounts and other treasury and cash management activities 
we continue to address these transition issues and do not expect the transition to the euro to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
at wil  systems are compatible with the euro and its financial statements are prepared in euros 
we expect to have our pet resins europe accounting systems  statutory reporting and tax reports compatible with the euro by april capital resources and liquidity our overall cash needs for were primarily provided from operations 
net cash provided by operations was million for  compared to million for  including approximately million for an asset securitization program 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in investing activities amounted to million in compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in the investments resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to our pearl river facility 
in  we sold certain production equipment in connection with a sale and leaseback transaction 
the million of proceeds from the sale were used to pay down debt 
for information related to expected capital expenditures in  see outlook above 
net cash used in financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in net repayments of long term debt amounted to million in compared to million of net borrowings in as noted above  we used the million of proceeds from the sale of certain equipment to pay down debt 
in february  we borrowed million pursuant to an senior unsecured note due february we used the proceeds from this debt to pay down other debt 
in conjunction with this financing  we entered into interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the total amount of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
in april  we voluntarily reduced the commitment amount on our million unsecured revolving credit facility to million 
the million day revolving credit facility  of which million is available under current bank commitments  remains unutilized 
in september  we amended our unsecured revolving credit facility and renewed the day revolving credit facility segment for an additional days 
the million four year revolving credit facility matures in september neither facility has scheduled principal repayments 
our financing agreements contain normal financial and restrictive covenants 
certain subsidiaries have guaranteed substantially all of our indebtedness for borrowed money 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have an effective universal shelf registration statement covering the issuance of up to million of debt and or equity securities 
we have not sold any securities under this shelf registration 
the financial resources available to us at december  included million under our revolving credit facilities and unused short term uncommitted lines of credit  the public and private debt and equity markets  and internally generated funds 
based on our debt level as of december   we could have had an average of approximately million of additional debt outstanding during the year without amending the terms of our debt agreements 
our current financing sources are primarily dependent on the bank and commercial paper markets since these are the lowest cost funds available 
the availability and cost of these funds can change in a short period of time for a variety of reasons 
as a result  we cannot be sure that low cost financing will be available 
however  we believe our financial resources will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable needs for working capital  capital expenditures and dividends

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which  as amended by statement no 
 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt statement no 
in january the statement will require us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivatives change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the adoption of statement no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

forward looking statements  risks and uncertainties statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  words such as believes  expects  anticipates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are made as of the date of this report based upon current expectations  and we undertake no obligation to update this information 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to demand and competition for polyester fiber and pet resins  the financial condition of our customers  availability and cost of raw materials  availability and cost of petrochemical feedstock necessary for the production process  changes in financial markets  interest rates  credit ratings  and foreign currency exchange rates  us  european  far eastern and global economic conditions  prices and volumes of imports  work stoppages  levels of production capacity and profitable operation of assets  changes in laws and regulations  prices of competing products  natural disasters  and our ability to complete expansions and other capital projects on time and budget and to maintain the operations of our existing production facilities 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed herein 
results of operations in any past period should not be considered indicative of results to be expected in future periods 
fluctuations in operating results may result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
in addition to those described above  the more prominent risks and uncertainties inherent in our business are set forth below 
however  this section does not discuss all possible risks and uncertainties to which we are subject  nor can it be assumed necessarily that there are no other risks and uncertainties which may be more significant to us 
economic conditions affect the supply and demand of our products 
capacity utilization  which is the demand for product divided by its supply  is a critical factor affecting our financial performance 
demand for polyester fiber historically has been cyclical because it is subject to changes in consumer preferences and spending  retail sales patterns  and fiber or textile product imports 
demand  prices and raw material costs for both fiber and pet resins may be affected by global economic conditions 
worldwide supply is expanding for both fiber and resins 
any significant expansion in supply over demand could reduce our profitability 
a material change in demand  supply or in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
adverse economic conditions also affect our customers 
if our customers have financial difficulties  this can affect their financial condition and credit worthiness which  in turn  could affect our profitability 
fiber and textile imports continue to adversely impact our margins 
the us and european fiber and textile markets continue to be severely impacted by imports  principally from far eastern countries 
imports of fiber and fiber products continue to cause an over supply which decreases fiber margins 
the price and volume of imports have and are expected to continue to significantly reduce the profitability of our businesses 
our operations are dependent on the availability and cost of our raw materials 
our operations are substantially dependent on the availability and cost of our two primary raw materials  pta and meg 
we currently rely on a single producer for our domestic supply of pta and a limited number of sources for meg 
the effect of the loss of any producer  or a disruption in their businesses or failure to meet our product needs on a timely basis would depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find a suitable alternative source 
at a minimum  temporary shortages in needed raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be sure that the precautions we have taken would be adequate or that an alternative source of supply could be located or developed in a timely manner 
changes in our financing costs could adversely affect our profitability 
the principal source of our financing is the bank and commercial paper markets 
these markets are volatile and rates fluctuate based on conditions in the markets and lenders perception of our business 
the bank markets can be influenced by the economy  by the general credit environment and by the performance of the individual financial institution 
the commercial paper markets can be influenced by other financial markets 
in addition  our ability to borrow at competitive costs is influenced by our public debt ratings 
significant disruptions in these markets or lowering of credit ratings could reduce our access to funds and increase our cost of funds 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability 
a large portion of our profitability is earned in entities where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
when these currencies weaken against the dollar  our profitability and the value of our investment in the foreign subsidiary decreases 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries conduct business in currencies other than their functional currency 
changes in the relative strength of these currencies can adversely affect the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries in their functional currency 
a portion of the net assets of these subsidiaries is denominated in other than their functional currency 
while we reduce our foreign currency exposure by using appropriate hedges  our foreign subsidiaries still have net assets denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and may experience foreign exchange losses 
as a result  a material change in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability 
increases in energy costs could adversely affect our profitability 
increases in energy costs impact our profitability by increasing our raw materials costs and production costs 
the prices of substantially all of our raw materials are impacted by changes in petrochemical costs 
our facilities utilize natural gas as their primary energy source  although some have the ability to switch a portion of their consumption to fuel oil 
an increase in these costs adversely affects our profitability 
actual costs for environmental matters may vary from the estimates 
actual costs to be incurred for identified environmental situations in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures due to unknown conditions  changing government regulations and legal standards regarding liability and evolving related technologies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative financial instruments we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we also utilize a derivative financial instrument to manage our exposure to compensation expense under a supplemental employee retirement plan serp 
for additional discussion of our use of such instruments  see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk because our obligations under our bank facilities  bid loans and uncommitted lines of credit bear interest at floating rates  our earnings and cash flows are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
a increase in market interest rates from those at december  and would reduce income before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively and reduce cash flow from operations by million and million  respectively 
our interest rate financial instruments at december  exactly match the terms of the million of fixed rate debt 
any potential decrease in the fair value of our interest rate financial instruments will be offset by changes in the value of our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency risk we use foreign currency debt and foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these financial instruments are specifically used to reduce the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments for our pet resins business in the netherlands  to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations relative to fixed asset purchase commitments  and to hedge certain accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
if foreign currency exchange rates at december  and adversely changed by  the fair value of these financial instruments outstanding at december  and would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
however  such loss in fair value would be substantially offset by an increase in the fair value of our underlying exposure 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential changes in any underlying hedged amount or changes in sales levels affected by changes in local currency prices
