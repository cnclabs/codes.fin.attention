cost of sales food and beverage costs were  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
food and beverage costs declined as a percentage of sales each year due to the combined effect of controlling food cost per guest and increases in the average check in and in addition  food costs benefited from the company s food program which manages cost through an efficient product rotation while maintaining a quality menu offering to the guest

cumulative effect of accounting change 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the cost of start up activities  which requires companies to expense the costs of start up activities and organization costs as incurred 
the company adopted sop effective for at the beginning of its fiscal year ending december  and expensed  of unamortized pre opening costs at the time of adoption 
quarterly information the following table sets forth certain quarterly results of operations for and year ended december  year ended december  first weeks second weeks third weeks last weeks first weeks second weeks third weeks last weeks in thousands  except per share amounts and restaurant data net sales       operating income loss  net income loss  net income loss per share basic diluted shares used in computing per share amounts basic       diluted       number of restaurants open open at end of quarter the sum of the quarterly net income loss per share amounts will not necessarily equal the net income loss per share for the total fiscal year the company s restaurants experience seasonal fluctuations  as a disproportionate amount of net sales and restaurant operating income are generally realized in the second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  the company s quarterly results of operations have been  and may continue to be  materially impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and by restaurant closings 
the fourth quarter normally includes weeks of operations as compared with weeks for each of the three prior quarters 
the fourth quarter of included weeks 
as a result of these factors  net sales and net income in the fourth quarter are not comparable to results in each of the first three fiscal quarters  and net sales and income can be expected to decline in the first quarter of each fiscal year in comparison to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
because of prior year operating losses  restaurant closures  the seasonality of the company s business and the impact of new restaurant openings  results for any quarter cannot be relied upon as indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary capital requirements have been for the expansion of its restaurant operations and remodeling of its restaurants 
the company has traditionally financed these requirements with funds from equity offerings  cash flow from operations  landlord allowances  capital equipment leases and short term bank debt 
the company does not have significant receivables or inventory and receives trade credit based upon negotiated terms in purchasing food and supplies 
the company has a  loan and security agreement the agreement with a finance company

on december   the company had  of long term debt borrowed under the terms of the agreement  of which the entire amount was included in the current portion of long term obligations as the agreement expires on december  as of december   the company had an additional  available for borrowing under the terms of the agreement 
the company intends to refinance the balance on this loan with another financial institution when the agreement expires 
borrowings under the agreement initially bear interest at the prime rate at december  plus and  once repaid  can be re borrowed unless converted to a term loan 
the  term loan converted under the agreement on december  is payable at th of the converted balance each month plus interest at above the prime rate 
all borrowings  including any term loans  are fully payable on december  aggregate borrowings in excess of  bear an additional interest 
the agreement also provides for a monthly collateral monitoring fee and a unused line fee 
the agreement requires the company to maintain a minimum net worth and debt service coverage ratio and to not exceed maximum interest and debt to cash flow ratios and limits its aggregate indebtedness 
the agreement also requires approval before paying dividends and limits the company s fixed asset acquisitions based on its operating cash flows 
long term debt at december  also included  of capital lease obligations  of which  was included in the current portion of long term obligations  and a  note for site construction costs 
operating activities for provided  of cash flows 
during the same period  the company invested  in property and equipment  including the remodeling of twenty two restaurants  which completed its remodeling program 
in addition  at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  the company opened its second fresh choice express test location and opened a third test location in the first quarter of the store closure reserve of  at december  consisted of the  remaining cash payments to be made on an agreement to settle the lease obligation on a restaurant closed in and the  of cash payments to be made for the buyout and termination of the lease on a former fresh choice restaurant in the washington dc market that the company sold in the company s outstanding series b non voting convertible preferred stock is currently held by one entity and is convertible  at the holders option  into series a voting convertible preferred stock on a one for one basis 
although no series a preferred stock is currently outstanding  holders of series a preferred stock  if any  would be entitled to vote with common stockholders on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
when and if issued  the holders of a majority of the outstanding series a preferred stock will have a separate right to approve certain corporate actions 
in fiscal  the company failed to achieve a specified earnings target before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of at least  which constituted an event of default of the terms of the preferred stock agreement and which triggered the right of the series a preferred stockholders to elect a majority of the company s board of directors 
the holder of the series b preferred stock has not initiated any action to convert such shares into shares of series a preferred stock nor has it exercised its right to elect a majority of the board of directors 
such holder has notified the company that it has no present intention of exercising such right  however  it has not waived any of its rights under the agreement 
the company s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to open new restaurants and to operate such restaurants profitably 
the company currently has signed leases for two new fresh choice restaurants in its core northern california market  which are expected to open in the company continues to look for sites  primarily in its core northern california markets as well as in southern california  and expects to open a minimum of three new fresh choice restaurants in in addition  the company is seeking an additional fresh choice express test location in texas 
the company s ability to implement an expansion strategy will depend upon a variety of factors  including its continued profitability and the company s ability to obtain funds 
see business risks included herein 
the company believes its operating cash requirements and fiscal capital requirements can be met through existing cash balances  cash provided by operations and its borrowing arrangements 
the company may continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to provide greater flexibility toward improving its operating performance and resuming restaurant expansion 
inflation many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage could materially increase the company s labor costs 
in addition  the cost of food commodities utilized by the company are subject to market supply and demand pressures 
shifts in these costs may have a significant impact on the company s food costs 
the company anticipates that increases in these costs may be offset through pricing and other cost control efforts  however  there is no assurance that the company would be able to pass such costs on to its guests or that even if it were able to do so  it could do so in a short period of time 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted this statement for its fiscal year beginning january  the company does not believe that adoption of this statement will impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if market rates were to increase immediately by percent from levels at december   the fair value of the company s borrowings would not be materially affected as borrowings are primarily subject to variable interest rates
