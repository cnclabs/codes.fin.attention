basis of presentation in february  the company s board of directors approved a plan  in principle  to sell its baker process division  which was separately accounted for as a segment 
accordingly  in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended december   this segment was accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented therein 
as of february  the company was not able to divest its baker process division as an entire business unit on terms it found acceptable and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company has reclassified its consolidated financial statements and related notes herein for all periods presented as if baker process had not been a discontinued operation 
future marketing efforts will focus on individual product lines 
the company s intent to dispose of its interest in the baker process product lines is only its present intent with respect to this matter 
the company s intent could change in the future depending on the relative value of a product line or the value and viability of an offer of a third party with respect to a proposed transaction regarding the product line 
business environment the company currently has seven divisions each with separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the divisions have been aggregated into two reportable segments oilfield and process 
the oilfield segment currently consists of six divisions baker atlas  baker hughes inteq  baker oil tools  baker petrolite  centrilift and hughes christensen that manufacture and sell equipment and provide related services used in exploring for  developing and producing hydrocarbon reserves 
the oilfield segment also includes the company s interest in an oil and gas property in nigeria 
the process segment consists of one division baker process that manufactures and sells process equipment for separating solids from liquids and liquids from liquids through filtration  sedimentation  centrifugation and flotation processes 
the business environment for the company s oilfield segment and its corresponding operating results can be significantly affected by the level of industry capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by oil company expectations about the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas products and by the energy price environment that results from supply and demand imbalances 
additionally  the company s largest customers have consolidated and are using their global size and market power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
key factors currently influencing the worldwide crude oil and gas market are production control the degree to which opec nations and other large producing countries are willing and able to restrict production and exports of crude oil 
global economic growth particularly in japan  china  south korea and the developing areas of asia where the correlation between energy demand and economic growth is strong 
oil and gas storage inventories relative to historic levels 
technological progress in the design and application of new products that allow oil and gas companies to drill fewer wells and to drill  complete and produce wells faster and at lower cost 
maturity of the resource base of known hydrocarbon reserves in the maturing provinces of the north sea  us  canada and latin america 
the pace of new investment access to capital and the reinvestment of available cash flow into existing and emerging markets 
price volatility the impact of widely fluctuating commodity prices on the stability of the market and subsequent impact on customer spending 
weather the impact of variations in temperatures as compared with normal weather patterns and the related effect on demand for oil and natural gas 
oil and gas prices generally  customer expectations about their prospects from oil and gas sales and customer expenditures to explore for or produce oil and gas rise or fall with corresponding changes in the prices of oil or gas 
accordingly  changes in these expenditures will normally result in increased or decreased demand for the company s products and services 
crude oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the three years ended december  while reading the company s outlook set forth below  caution is advised that the factors described above in forward looking statements and business environment could negatively impact the company s expectations for oil demand  oil and gas prices and drilling activity 
west texas intermediate crude bbl us spot natural gas mmbtu oil prices averaged per barrel for the year  ranging from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
oil prices increased due to a resurgence in worldwide demand led by a recovery of asian markets  coupled with lower production levels from non opec countries 
the resulting decrease in global oil inventories  particularly in north america  provided stronger price support and increased stability in the market 
us natural gas prices increased in compared with  averaging mmbtu and ranging from a low of mmbtu to a high of mmbtu 
the increase is due to a reduction in available gas supply brought about by the sustained slow down in gas directed drilling in the us experienced from january to june the price increase was sustained by concerns that the natural gas industry would be in short supply for the winter of rotary rig count the company is engaged in the oilfield service industry providing products and services that are used in exploring for  developing and producing oil and gas reservoirs 
when drilling or workover rigs are active  they consume the products and services produced by the oilfield service industry 
the active rig count acts as a leading indicator of consumption of products and services used in drilling  completing  producing and processing hydrocarbons 
rig count trends are governed by the exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies  which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas 
rig counts therefore reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices 
the company s rotary rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the three years ended december  and are based on weekly rig counts for the us and canada and monthly rig counts for all other areas 
us land us offshore canada latin america western hemisphere    north sea other europe africa middle east asia pacific eastern hemisphere worldwide    us workover rigs   outlook while reading the company s outlook set forth below  caution is advised that the factors described above in forward looking statements and business environment could negatively impact the company s expectations for oil demand  oil and gas prices and drilling activity 
oil through the balance of  oil prices are expected to be influenced by worldwide economic growth  changes in non opec oil supply  weather and opec s willingness and ability to control production to achieve its price targets 
possible scenarios include a combination of a colder than normal winter and insufficient supply or aggressive production restraint from opec could result in oil prices exceeding per barrel in the first half of for an extended period 
such high oil prices could contribute to a global economic slowdown in the second half of  which could result in reduced demand and prices that could fall below per barrel by the end of if opec is willing and able to control production and can adjust production to meet its price targets  then oil prices could moderate from to per barrel through the winter of and trade between and per barrel for the balance of if opec is unwilling or unable to decrease production in  prices could moderate from to per barrel through the winter of and trade between and per barrel throughout the balance of  particularly if non opec production increases significantly 
natural gas u 
s 
natural gas prices are expected to remain strong throughout  averaging between mmbtu and mmbtu because of continued low storage levels  increased demand and reduced supply throughout the winter of  the injection season  and through the winter of customer spending based upon the company s discussions with its major customers  customer spending directed at developing north american natural gas is expected to increase in as compared with  but is likely to be limited by the availability of drilling rigs  crews and oilfield services in north america 
outside north america  customer spending directed at developing oil supplies is expected to increase  primarily outside of north america 
venture formation on november   the company and schlumberger limited  a netherlands antilles corporation schlumberger  and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of schlumberger created a venture by transferring the seismic fleets  data processing assets  exclusive and nonexclusive multi client surveys and other assets of the company s western geophysical division and schlumberger s geco prakla

revenues from production of crude oil increased from million in to million in as certain projects previously in development stage began production 
revenues for were  million  an increase of over revenues of  million 
the increase was due to various acquisitions made by the company in and in the latter part of  offset by activity level declines as the average worldwide rig count in fell when compared with these activity declines were brought about by the significant drop in the price of oil and natural gas in the second half of and the resultant decrease in customer spending

these rates vary primarily due to fluctuations in taxes from international operations 
in  the company provided million of foreign and additional us taxes as a result of the repatriation of the proceeds from the formation of the western geco venture in december the formation of the venture also reduces the expected amount of foreign source income against which to use the foreign tax credit carryover  therefore  the company provided million for additional us taxes with respect to future repatriation of earnings necessary to utilize the foreign tax credit carryover 
capital resources and liquidity operating activities net cash inflows from operating activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the slight increase in cash flow from to relates to higher net income 
the reduction in cash flow from to is due to lower net income  after including the noncash portion of unusual items  payments on accruals for merger and unusual related items of million and decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities caused by lower business levels

the initiative  named project renaissance  utilizes sap r as its software platform across all significant operations of the company and is expected to cost in excess of million over a four year period of which million has been spent as of december  the words expected and expects are intended to identify forward looking statements in investing activities 
see forward looking statements and business environment above for a description of risk factors related to these forward looking statements 
financing activities net cash outflows inflows from financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively

accounting standards derivative and hedge accounting in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities that require an entity to recognize all derivatives as an asset or liability measured at fair value 
depending on the intended use of the derivative  changes in its fair value will be reported in the period of change as either a component of earnings or a component of other comprehensive income 
based on the company s derivative positions at december   the company will report a gain from the cumulative effect of adoption of million  net of tax  and a gain in accumulated other comprehensive income of million  net of tax  as of january  euro conversion a single european currency the euro was introduced on january   at which time the conversion rates between the old  or legacy  currencies and the euro were set for participating member countries 
however  the legacy currencies in those countries will continue to be used as legal tender through january  thereafter  the legacy currencies will be canceled  and euro bills and coins will be used in participating countries 
most of the company s products and services are essentially priced with reference to the us dollar 
as a result  the company does not believe that it will be subject to a significant increase in pricing transparency due to the introduction of the euro 
the company s customers may require billing in two or more currencies 
until the company s financial computer systems are modified or replaced to handle euro denominated transactions  the company will  in most cases  need to apply a methodology whereby legacy currencies are first converted into euros according to the legally prescribed fixed exchange ratio and then  when the customer requires  converted from euros to a second national currency 
the company does not believe that this conversion will materially affect its contracts 
most of the company s contracts are either bids in response to requests for tenders or purchase orders  both of which are short term in nature 
longer term contracts are sufficiently flexible to permit pricing in multiple currencies 
the euro conversion period is longer than most of the pricing features of these contracts  thus permitting a pricing conversion to the euro as new orders are issued 
the same is true with most of the company s contracts with vendors 
during  the company began a multi year initiative designed to develop and implement an enterprise wide software system 
the initiative  named project renaissance  utilizes sap r as its software platform across all significant operations of the company 
sap r is programmed to process in euros for most of the company s accounting  financial and operational functions  and the company expects that the implementation of this system will address its euro issues in these areas 
because the company has engaged in this implementation for operational purposes and not solely to address euro issues  the company has not separately determined the cost of converting these systems for use with the euro 
these euro conversion costs are embedded in the cost of project renaissance and are not susceptible to separate quantification 
the company has scheduled implementation of sap r in its major european operations prior to january  alternatively  the company may make certain modifications to its legacy computer systems  or replace them  to address certain euro conversion issues  pending full implementation of sap r the company began converting certain legacy currency based financial records to the euro beginning in january with all significant records expected to be converted by september  the company continues to assess the impact of the euro on its operations and financial  accounting and operational systems 
the company does not presently anticipate that the transition to the euro will have a significant impact on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the words anticipate  will  may  and expects are intended to identify a forward looking statement in euro conversion 
the company s anticipation regarding the lack of significance of the euro introduction on the company s operations is only its forecast regarding this matter 
this forecast may be substantially different from actual results  which are affected by factors such as the following unforeseen difficulties in remediating specific computer systems to accommodate the euro due to the complexity of hardware and software  the failure of the company to implement sap r or another euro compliant computer system in a geographic location that prices in euros  the inability of third parties to adequately address their own euro systems issues  including vendors  contractors  financial institutions  us and foreign governments and customers  the delay in completion of a phase of the company s remediation of a computer system to accommodate the euro necessary to begin a later phase  the discovery of a greater number of hardware and software systems or technologies with material euro issues than the company presently anticipates  and the lack of alternatives that the company previously believed existed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in the company s financial instruments that arise in the normal course of business 
the company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk  that is  the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt 
commercial paper borrowings  other short term borrowings and variable rate long term debt do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings either have maturities of less than three months or have variable interest rates 
all other things being equal  the fair market value of the company s debt with a fixed interest rate will increase and the amount required to retire that debt today will increase  as interest rates fall and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
this exposure to interest rate risk is managed by borrowing money that has a variable interest rate or using interest rate swaps to change fixed interest rate borrowings to variable interest rate borrowings 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt aggregating billion and variable rate debt aggregating billion 
the following table sets forth  as of december  and  the company s principal cash flows for its long term debt obligations  which bear a fixed rate of interest and are denominated in us dollars  and the related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the table sets forth the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates of the company s interest rate swaps by expected maturity dollar amounts in millions 
thereafter total as of december  long term debt   weighted average interest rates fixed to variable swaps pay rate receive rate as of december  long term debt   weighted average interest rates fixed to variable swaps pay rate receive rate fair market value of long term debt is  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
fair market value of the interest rate swaps is a million liability and a million liability at december  and  respectively 
six month libor plus settled semi annually 
this swap matured in january includes the liquid yield option notes with an accreted value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
average six month libor for the japanese yen  euro and the swiss franc plus included in the table above in the thereafter column is the company s liquid yield option notes lyons  which are convertible into the company s common stock 
at the option of the holder  the lyons may be redeemed for cash on may   for a redemption price equal to the issue price plus accrued original issue discount through the date of redemption 
the company does not expect that the holders will redeem the lyons for cash in may as long as the company s common stock trades at levels above the conversion price 
the market price of the company s common stock at december  of was below the lyons conversion price of 
investments during  the company sold its investment in common stock and common stock warrants of varco  at an average price of per share 
total proceeds from the sale of the company s investment in the common stock and the warrants were million 
crude oil hedges on september   the company entered into two crude oil contracts costless collars to hedge price risk associated with the company s interest in an oil producing property in nigeria 
the contracts  which use wti nymex as the reference commodity  establish a cap of and a floor of for the three month period ending march   and a cap of and a floor of for the three month period ending june   respectively 
the fair value of these contracts at december  results in a million asset 
foreign currency the company s operations are conducted in a number of different countries around the world 
as such  future earnings are subject to change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currencies the primary currencies in which the company conducts its business in various jurisdictions 
at december   the company had entered into a foreign currency forward contract with a notional amount of million to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the british pound 
at december   the fair market value of this forward contract  based on year end quoted market prices for contracts with similar terms and maturity dates  was a million asset 
foreign currency gains and losses for hedges against exposure to currency fluctuations are marked to market and changes to the fair value are included in current period income 
the counterparties to the company s forward contracts are major financial institutions 
the credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis and  in management s opinion  present no significant credit risk to the company 
in the unlikely event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract  the company s exposure is limited to the foreign currency spot rate differential 
certain borrowings of the company are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
at december   these nonfunctional currency borrowings totaled million with exposures between the us dollar and the british pound  the saudi riyal and the malaysian ringgit 
a movement of the us dollar against these currencies would not have a significant effect on the future earnings of the company
