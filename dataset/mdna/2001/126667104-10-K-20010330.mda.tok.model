our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview cv therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
since our inception in december  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to research and development 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and do not expect to generate any product revenues for at least several years 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our sources of revenues  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under corporate partnerships and interest income 
the process of developing our products will require significant additional research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approval 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will not receive product revenues unless we or our collaborative partners complete clinical trials and successfully commercialize one or more of our products 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts and clinical trials  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approval 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us and  in some cases  our collaborators  to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory clearances  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements and obtain market acceptance 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
results of operations years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenues were million for the year ended december  while there were none for the year ended december  the collaborative research revenues for the year ended december  included a million milestone payment from our partner  biogen inc  which was released in connection with its completion of a phase ii trial of cvt and its decision to continue with the a adenosine receptor antagonist program 
the remaining revenues relate to our collaboration with fujisawa healthcare  inc and consisted of both the amortization of up front payments and the reimbursement of certain development costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to greater external costs associated with ranolazine and cvt clinical trials  in addition to hiring additional employees to provide support for an increased level of activity in our research  development and clinical programs 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in the future as we further expand product development efforts and clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to greater use of outside consultants for general business matters 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future in line with our research  development and commercialization activities 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher average investment balances as the result of our follow on public offering in october and the sale of convertible subordinated notes in march we expect that interest income will fluctuate with average investment balances and market interest rates 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to interest expense related to the convertible subordinated notes issued in march  which totaled million for the year 
we expect that interest and other expense will fluctuate with average loan balances 
taxes 
we have not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses potentially available to offset future taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
because we have experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
the state carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and state income tax liabilities 
years ended december  and collaborative research revenues 
there were no collaborative research revenues for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the collaborative research revenues for the year ended december  were the result of our completion of the research component of our collaboration with biogen during the first quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in was due to hiring additional employees to provide support for an increased level of activity in our research  development and clinical programs  in addition to greater external costs for the clinical programs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in outside legal expenses for a variety of administrative and corporate development activities 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our average investment balance increased as a result of our follow on public offering that was completed in october interest and other expense 
interest and other expense decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a charge of  recognized during the first quarter of related to the early retirement of a capital lease obligation offset by a higher average loan balance 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
in january  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we drew down million under a general purpose loan facility with biogen 
in may  we entered into a sales and marketing services agreement with innovex inc pursuant to which innovex s parent  quintiles transnational corp  purchased  shares of our common stock for a total investment of million 
in addition  we entered into two promissory notes with quintiles 
the first promissory note in the amount of million may be drawn down by us upon filing a new drug application for ranolazine 
the second promissory note shall be for an amount to be determined after commercial launch of ranolazine 
both notes are convertible into shares of common stock at the option of quintiles upon the occurrence of certain events 
in october  we completed a follow on public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in march  we entered into a purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold to certain purchasers million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the offering of the notes was made to qualified institutional buyers under rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of per year  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the notes will mature on march  and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
we may  at our option  redeem the notes at any time after march  or earlier if our stock price reachs certain defined levels 
in march  we repaid the initial million installment under the biogen loan facility  bringing the outstanding balance to million 
in july we entered into a collaboration with fujisawa healthcare  inc to develop and market second generation pharmacologic cardiac stress agents 
under this agreement we received million from fujisawa healthcare  inc consisting of an up front payment and the purchase of our common stock 
in july  we received a financing commitment from acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
to purchase up to million of our common stock through november as of december  we have issued shares representing million under this commitment 
in august  we drew down an additional million under a general purpose loan facility with biogen bringing the outstanding balance to million 
in october  we exercised our right to convert million in debt from the biogen loan facility into  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  in full repayment of the entire principal amount under this loan facility 
in december  we repaid all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan facility  in full repayment of the loan facility 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase was due to the proceeds of million from the sale of convertible subordinated notes  net of issuance costs of million  plus million raised through the issuance of common stock  offset by million used to fund operations and million used to repay debt 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operations increased by only million even though our net loss increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in net loss was offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  resulting primarily from up front payments received from fujisawa healthcare  and a million increase in accrued and other liabilities 
as of december   we have invested million in property and equipment with the rate of investment having increased in line with increased research and development efforts 
we expect to continue to make investments in property and equipment to support our growth 
we may require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize any potential products 
we currently estimate that our existing resources and projected interest income  including the proceeds from our recently completed offering of convertible subordinated notes and common stock financing  will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain corporate partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result
