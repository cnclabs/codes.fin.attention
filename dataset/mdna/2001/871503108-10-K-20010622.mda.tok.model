recent divestitures on december   we divested our visual cafe and act product lines 
because the divestitures of the visual cafe and act product lines were effective at the close of business on december   these product lines are included in the results of operations through december  for further discussion on our recent acquisitions and divestitures  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth each item from our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net revenues and the percentage change in the total amount of each item for the periods indicated 
period to period percentage increase decrease year ended march  compared compared to to net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill amortization of intangibles from acquisitions acquired in process research and development restructuring and other expenses litigation judgment total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income percentage change is not meaningful net revenues net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal were largely due to increased sales to our enterprise customers  introductions of new products and increased sales outside of north america 
during the december quarter  we acquired axent  which contributed approximately million to our total net revenues for fiscal consumer products our consumer products segment represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
although net revenues for this segment decreased as a percentage of net revenues  net revenues in absolute dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal despite the slow down in the personal computer sales environment  the absolute dollars increased primarily due to the increase in customer focus on protecting their home computers from internet related attacks 
this factor contributed to growth in sales of our norton internet security product  which was introduced in the march quarter 
net revenues in absolute dollars increased in the consumer products segment in fiscal over fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our antivirus products following outbreaks of significant viruses  new releases of both new and existing products and our customers preparing for the year rollover 
these factors contributed to growth in sales of norton antivirus  norton systemworks and norton we have since discontinued our norton product 
during fiscal  and  the financial impact of product price reductions for certain of our products was offset by the increase in the volume of products sold 
enterprise security and administration our enterprise security and administration segments represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to due to the continued strength of our virus protection solution  growth from our vulnerability management and intrusion detection solutions as a result of the axent acquisition  and the new release of our ghost corporate edition product 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to strong demand for our enterprise administration products ghost corporate edition and pcanywhere and increases due to virus outbreaks and year preparation 
services and other our services and other segments represented approximately  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal and is due to our divestiture of the visual cafe and act product lines in december  which is included in the other segment 
international net revenues outside of north america represented  and of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
international net revenues increased by million in fiscal to million from million in this increase in net revenues was the result of increased sales in europe and japan 
net revenues from sales outside of north america increased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this increase was also largely due to stronger sales in europe and japan 
weaknesses in currencies fixed to the euro during fiscal  slightly offset by strengths in other currencies  negatively impacted our international revenue growth by approximately million 
the impact in fiscal was approximately million 
pro forma revenue giving effect to the acquisition of axent and divestitures for comparative purposes  the following table displays  on a pro forma basis  our net revenues as if the acquisition of axent had occurred at the beginning of fiscal and excluding the divested visual cafe and act product lines year ended march  in thousands pro forma net revenues    quarterly pro forma net revenues for the year ended march  would have been as follows  for the quarter ended consumer enterprise enterprise total in thousands products security administration services other company june      september      december      march      product returns we estimate and maintain reserves for product returns 
product returns principally relate to stock balancing and the replacement of obsolete products  which are offset by orders of equal or greater value for the current versions of the products 
the mix of products returned from our distributors resellers as compared to products sold to our distributors resellers does not impact our gross margin  as our gross margin is materially consistent across our various product families 
changes in the level of product returns and related product returns provision are generally offset by a change in the level of gross revenue 
as a result  the product returns provision did not have a material impact on reported net revenues in any period presented 
gross margin gross margin represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing expenses  costs for producing manuals  packaging costs  royalties paid to third parties under publishing contracts and amortization and write off of acquired product rights 
gross margin was of net revenues in fiscal and of net revenues in fiscal and the improvement in gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to higher margins associated with the increase in enterprise related sales and cost savings achieved in reduced packaging costs 
acquired product rights as indicated in the overview  during fiscal we acquired axent and recorded approximately million in acquired product rights 
during fiscal  we acquired urlabs  l network security s operations and software and recorded approximately million in acquired product rights 
amortization of these intangibles  which are included in cost of revenues  totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the amortization of intangible assets from our fiscal and acquisitions will occur over the next years 
for further discussion on acquired product rights and related amortization  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
research and development expenses we charge research and development expenditures to operations as incurred 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses remained flat at for fiscal and and were for fiscal the overall growth in our net revenues was the primary reason for the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal although research and development expenses remained flat as a percentage of net revenues  absolute dollars increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of enterprise security segment hiring  salary increases and other employee related expenses and axent related research and development expenses which were included from the date of acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by the lack of expenses in fiscal associated with the divested visual cafe and act product lines and the patent claim settlements in the consumer products segment 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was a result of increases in software development costs paid to additional contractors  employee related expenses and additional costs for settlements related to disputes over technology rights in fiscal  offset by a reduction of research and development expenses resulting from our divestitures 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues remained flat at for fiscal and and was for fiscal sales and marketing expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to enterprise security segment hiring and increase in salaries  commissions and other performance based compensation and axent related sales and marketing expenses which were included from the date of acquisition 
the absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing dollars for fiscal over fiscal was also due to increased headcount  related salaries  commission and other performance based compensation 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal and in fiscal and general and administrative expenses were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses and other general administrative expenses  offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  legal fees and bad debt expenses  offset by reductions in certain consulting expenses incurred in fiscal amortization of goodwill amortization of goodwill increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was related to amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of axent in fiscal amortization of goodwill increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was related to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisitions of urlabs  l network security s operations and software in fiscal acquired in process research and development expenses in fiscal  we acquired axent 
in fiscal  we acquired urlabs and l network security s operations 
in fiscal  we acquired ibm s and intel s anti virus businesses  binary research s operations and quarterdeck 
we wrote off approximately million  million and million of acquired in process research and development associated with these acquisitions in fiscal  and  respectively 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative uses 
the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally relate to the completion of all planning  design  development and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design specifications including features  functions and performance 
we expect the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
however  there are no assurances that this will occur 
if we fail to complete these products in their entirety  or in a timely manner  we may not continue to attract new users  we may be unable to retain our existing users and the value of the other intangible assets may become impaired 
we determined the fair value of the acquired in process technology for each of the purchases by estimating the projected cash flows related to these projects  including the cost to complete the acquired in process technologies and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting cash flows back to their net present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
a valuation specialist used our estimates to establish the amount of acquired in process research and development to be written off for these acquisitions in fiscal  and as a result  we wrote off million in connection with our acquisition of axent in fiscal using the following analysis axent the following discussion contains forward looking statements of certain aspects of our expected future operating results from the operations of axent 
actual results may differ from the estimates expressly or implicitly referred to by these forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include those identified in the business risk factors set forth in this item we are using the acquired in process research and development associated with axent to create additional opportunities in internet security  primarily in the assessment and management of securing networks for enterprises 
the in process technology acquired in the axent acquisition consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of esm  intruder alert  raptor firewall  webthority and other projects 
axent s research and development was focused on providing more robust features in its development of these next generation products 
we assumed that revenue attributable to axent s in process technologies would be approximately million in the first year and increase in the second and third years of the five year projection period at annual rates of and  respectively  and then decrease at rates of and over the remaining two years 
we projected annual revenues to range between approximately million and million over the projected period 
these projections were based on aggregate growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  anticipated product development cycles  and the life of the underlying technology 
we estimated selling  general and administrative expenses for the in process technology to be of revenue in each year of the five year projection period 
we projected operating results before acquisition related amortization charges to range from an million profit during the first year to an million profit during each of the second and third years 
we projected that the operating profits would then decrease in the fourth year and in the fifth year  resulting in profits of approximately million and million  respectively 
we estimated costs to be incurred to reach technological feasibility of the in process technologies from axent as of the date of the acquisition to total approximately million 
we estimated the in process technology to be between and complete at that time 
we used a discount rate of for valuing the in process technologies from axent  which we believe reflects the risk associated with the completion of these research and development projects and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to their completion 
this discount rate is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of  due to the risks related to the fact that the technology had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the valuation 
the assumptions and projections discussed for the technologies acquired from axent were based on information available at the time and should not be taken as indications of actual results  which could vary materially based on the risks and uncertainties identified in the business risk factors set forth in this item l network security the in process technology acquired in the l network security purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of retriever and expert 
we have integrated this technology into our vulnerability management products 
the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the research and development acquired from l networks security have not significantly changed 
urlabs the in process technology acquired in the urlabs purchase consisted primarily of research and development related to the next generation of urlabs two main products  i gear and mail gear  which have been added to our product offerings 
the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the research and development acquired from urlabs have not significantly changed 
ibm the in process technology acquired in the ibm purchase primarily consisted of the ibm immune system technology and related anti virus patents 
we have integrated this technology into our anti virus products 
the original assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the immune system and related anti virus technology acquired from ibm have not significantly changed 
binary research the in process technology acquired in the binary research acquisition primarily consisted of disk cloning technologies associated with ghost  the flagship product of binary research  which has been added to our product offerings 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the disk cloning technologies acquired from binary research have not significantly changed 
intel the in process technology acquired in the intel purchase consisted of the landesk anti virus technology  which resides in the landesk virus protect product line 
this technology has been integrated into our corporate anti virus offerings 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the landesk anti virus technology acquired from intel have not significantly changed 
quarterdeck the in process technology acquired in our acquisition of quarterdeck consisted of projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line 
these technologies have been integrated into norton systemworks and are sold as a stand alone product 
the assumptions and projections discussed in prior filings for the projects related to quarterdeck s cleansweep product line have not significantly changed 
restructuring and other expenses during the march quarter  we reorganized various operating functions  thereby reducing our workforce by employees  and recorded approximately million for the costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
in addition  we provided approximately million for costs of severance and related benefits for six members of our senior management due to a realignment of certain responsibilities 
during the december quarter  we reduced a portion of our operations in toronto  thereby reducing our workforce by employees  and recorded approximately million for the costs of severance  related benefits and abandonment of certain equipment 
in addition  approximately million was provided for costs of severance and related benefits for four members of our senior management due to a realignment of certain responsibilities

as a result  we vacated the facility in melville and we reduced the space occupied in toronto 
we recorded approximately million for employee severance  outplacement and abandonment of certain facilities and equipment during the march quarter 
in addition  we provided approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior management due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting departures during the march quarter 
during the december quarter  we reduced our internet tools business unit s workforce and reduced our sales workforce 
there were employees in the internet tools business unit affected  resulting in a charge of approximately million for severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
the sales workforce reduction affected employees  resulting in a charge of approximately million for severance  related benefits and outplacement services 
during the september quarter  we provided approximately million for costs of severance  related benefits and outplacement services for two members of senior management due to the realignment of our business units and their resulting departures 
we also recorded approximately million for certain costs related to an agreement reached with our former ceo in the june quarter 
these costs were comprised of severance and the acceleration of unvested stock options 
during the september quarter  we made a decision to restructure our operations and outsource domestic manufacturing operations 
as a result  we originally recorded a million charge for personnel severance to reduce the workforce by approximately in both domestic and international operations and a million charge for the planned abandonment of a manufacturing facility lease 
these estimates were subsequently revised in the september quarter  resulting in a reduction in the personnel severance and outplacement accruals by approximately million 
for further discussion on restructuring and other expenses  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
litigation judgment during the june quarter  we accrued litigation expenses of approximately million related to a judgment by a canadian court on a decade old copyright action assumed by us as a result of our acquisition of delrina corporation 
for further discussion on our current litigation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense interest income was approximately million in and was relatively flat at million in fiscal and interest income increased in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to a higher average cash balance during fiscal as compared to prior years 
interest expense was approximately million in fiscal the interest expense in fiscal was principally related to our convertible subordinated debentures  which were converted into our common stock in february and for interest on quarterdeck s subordinated notes that were paid off in march interest expense was not significant in fiscal and other expense  net was approximately million in fiscal and consisted primarily of net losses on our equity investments 
other income  net was approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and was primarily comprised of gains and losses from non functional currency exchange transactions 
for further discussion on the net loss on our equity investments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines the components of income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines are as follows year ended march  in thousands royalties from interact   gain on divestiture of visual cafe product line  act product line  transition fees payments from hp and jetform   income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines    gain on divestiture of visual cafe on december   we sold the principal assets and liabilities of the visual cafe product line to webgain  inc  or webgain 
the assets primarily consisted of fixed assets and intangible assets 
the liabilities related to certain revenue deferrals 
in exchange for the assets and liabilities sold to webgain  we received million in a lump sum cash payment on december  we wrote off or transferred approximately million of capitalized software  fixed assets and inventory related to the visual cafe product line 
in addition  we accrued approximately million in transaction costs and million in retention packages for the affected employees 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the divestiture 
gain on divestiture of act and royalties from interact on december   we licensed substantially all of the act product line technology  on an exclusive basis  to interact commerce corporation  previously saleslogix corporation  or interact  for a period of four years 
in addition  we sold the inventory and fixed assets related to the act product line to interact 
in consideration for the license and assets  interact transferred to us  shares of its unregistered common stock 
these shares were valued at approximately million as of december   the date the license was signed and the date the number of shares was determined 
as a result of the license  we recognized approximately million of income from the shares received  which was offset by approximately million of inventory and fixed assets attributed to the act product line that was written off and transferred to interact 
in addition  we accrued approximately million for transaction related costs incurred at december  after recognizing the above amounts  we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million 
during the march quarter  interact entered into a plan to merge with the sage group plc and we recorded a loss of approximately million as other expense related to the other than temporary decline in value of our investment in interact 
for further discussion on our investment in interact  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
in addition to the shares received from interact  interact is required to pay us quarterly royalty payments for four years 
interact will pay these royalties based on future revenues  up to an aggregate maximum of million 
because the royalties are not guaranteed and the quarterly amounts to be received are not determinable until earned  we are recognizing these royalties as payments are due 
we recorded approximately million and million of royalty payments in income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines in fiscal and  respectively 
transition fees in accordance with individual transition agreements  webgain and interact paid us fees for invoicing  collecting receivables  shipping and other operational and support activities through fiscal  until they had the ability to take over these activities 
we recorded approximately million and million for these fees during fiscal and  respectively  in income  net of expense  from sale of technologies and product lines 
payments from hp and jetform payments from hp and jetform were associated with our sale of certain software products  technologies and tangible assets to the hewlett packard company and jetform corporation during fiscal the payments decreased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal these payments also decreased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the payments declined in fiscal and  because the hp payments ended in the december quarter and the payments from jetform ended in the june quarter 
income taxes our effective tax rate on income before one time charges acquired in process research and development  restructuring and other expenses  goodwill amortization expense and gain on sale of product lines was for fiscal  and our fiscal  and effective rates were lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate primarily due to a lower statutory tax rate on our irish operations 
our effective tax rate on income was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development and substantially all of the goodwill amortization 
the higher effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the non deductibility of acquired in process research and development 
in addition  for fiscal  tax was provided on the gain on sale of product lines at an effective tax rate of 
this rate is lower than the us federal and state combined statutory rate because a portion of the gain is attributable to our irish operations and accordingly subject to a lower irish tax rate 
realization of a significant portion of the million of net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income of approximately million 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the million of deferred tax assets will be realized based on historical earnings and expected levels of future us taxable income 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in the business risk factors set forth in this item additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
we project our effective tax rate on income before goodwill amortization to be in fiscal this projection  however  is subject to change due to potential tax law changes and fluctuations in the geographic allocation of earnings 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased approximately million to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal this increase was largely due to cash provided from operations  including royalty income from interact  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans  sales of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  and acquired axent cash balances 
the cash provided by these factors was partially offset by cash paid to repurchase common stock  for capital expenditures  and for marketable securities and investments 
in addition to cash and short term investments  we have million of restricted investments related to collateral requirements under certain lease agreements 
we are obligated under these lease agreements for two office buildings in cupertino  california to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed three years 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet our operating cash requirements 
this lease is classified as an operating lease 
we were in compliance with our covenants on these lease agreements as of march  future acquisitions or other events could cause us to be in violation of these covenants 
on march   we entered into a master lease agreement for land and the construction of two office buildings in newport news  virginia  effective june   and eugene  oregon  effective april  we are obligated under the lease agreement to maintain a restricted cash balance invested in us treasury securities with maturities not to exceed two years  during the construction period  or in certificates of deposit issued by certain lenders  after the construction period 
in accordance with the lease terms  these funds are not available to meet our operating cash requirements 
as of march   we had no restricted funds associated with these facilities 
this lease is classified as an operating lease 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants 
future acquisitions or other events could cause us to be in violation of these financial covenants 
as of march   we also had a million line of credit that expired may we were in compliance with the debt covenants for this line of credit as of march  there were no borrowings and less than million of standby letters of credit outstanding under this line as of march  although we did not renew this line of credit  we believe that there will not be a material adverse impact on our financial results  liquidity or capital resources 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million and was comprised of net income of approximately million  non cash related expenses of million and a net increase of million in liabilities  net of an increase in assets 
net trade accounts receivable increased million to approximately million at march  from approximately million at march  the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the acquisition of axent s accounts receivable balances and increases in our enterprise security and international sales 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million and was comprised primarily of million in net proceeds from sales of marketable securities and investments and million in acquired axent cash balances  offset by million of capital expenditures and other investing activities 
on march   the board authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
on january   the board replaced this authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to million  not to exceed million shares  of symantec common stock with no expiration date 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares at prices ranging from to  for an aggregate amount of approximately million 
we believe that existing cash and short term investments and cash generated from operating results will be sufficient to fund operations for the next year 
recent accounting pronouncements on february   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a limited revision of its september  exposure draft  business combinations and intangible assets  that proposes to significantly change the accounting for goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination 
under the revised proposal  goodwill would not be amortized but would be reviewed for impairment annually and if certain events occur or circumstances exist 
goodwill impairment charges would be presented as a separate line item within the operating section of the income statement 
the nonamortization approach would apply to previously recorded goodwill as well as goodwill arising from acquisitions completed after the application of the new standard 
amortization of the remaining book value of goodwill would cease and the new impairment only approach would apply 
the fasb expects to release the final statement in july we will not adopt the provisions of the proposed statement  which defers reporting the effects of the proposed statement  until our first quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which defers the adoption of sfas no 
for one year 
sfas will be effective for symantec at the beginning of the june quarter for both annual and interim reporting periods 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
business risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements may be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to this difference include  among others things  those risk factors set forth in this section and elsewhere in this report 
we identify forward looking statements by words such as may  will  should  could  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  or continue or similar terms that refer to the future 
we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions which give rise to a number of risks that could have adverse consequences for our future operating results 
we have made eight acquisitions within the last three fiscal years  with our acquisition of axent being the largest and most recent 
integrating acquired businesses may distract our management focus from other opportunities and challenges 
our past acquisitions have given rise to  and future acquisitions may result in  substantial levels of goodwill and other intangible assets that may be amortized or written off in future years 
in addition  a number of our recent acquisitions have resulted in our incurring substantial write offs of acquired in process research and development costs and this also may occur as a result of future acquisitions 
we may issue equity or incur debt to finance future acquisitions that are dilutive to our existing stockholders 
continued integration of axent may be difficult  which may adversely affect operations 
we have been in the process of integrating axent into our operations since the date of acquisition 
this integration of axent with our business  however  has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not accomplished in a timely and efficient manner 
we must operate as a combined organization utilizing common information and communications systems  operating procedures  financial controls and human resources practices 
we may still encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays involved in integrating our operations  including potential conflicts between business cultures  perceived adverse changes in business focus  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  the loss of key employees  and or the diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
further  the market price of our common stock could decline if the integration of axent is unsuccessful  we are unable to successfully market our products and services to axent s customers or axent s products and services to our customers  we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by financial or industry analysts  or such analysts do not perceive the same benefits to the merger as both axent and we do  or the effect of the merger on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 
our increased sales of enterprise wide site licenses may increase fluctuations in our financial results 
sales of enterprise wide site licenses through our enterprise security segment have been increasing and now represent a major portion of our business 
this portion of our business could increase significantly due to our recent acquisition of axent 
this enterprise market has significantly different characteristics than the consumer market and different skills and resources are needed to penetrate this market 
licensing arrangements tend to involve a longer sales cycle than sales through other distribution channels  require greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and can sometimes result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we expect to make substantial changes to our information systems that could disrupt our business 
the information systems that support our accounting  finance  order management and manufacturing systems are based on oracle  and many of the business applications used in other aspects of our business have been tightly coupled with oracle oracle has released a new version  i  and has announced that support for will be discontinued at the end of in addition  as our business has grown  we have developed needs for an increasingly robust customer relationship management  or crm  system 
during fiscal  we will be implementing oracle i and a new crm system 
these types of transitions frequently prove disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise and may cause us to incur higher costs than we anticipate 
failure to manage a smooth transition to the new systems could result in a material adverse effect on our business operations 
our software products and web site may be subject to intentional disruption 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  such as software viruses specifically designed to impede the performance of our products  we expect to be an ongoing target of such disruptions 
similarly  experienced computer programmers  or hackers  may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our web site and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
our activities could be substantially disrupted and our reputation  and future sales  harmed if these efforts are successful 
our markets are highly competitive and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by this competition 
our markets are intensely competitive 
this competition could adversely affect our operating results by reducing our sales or the prices we can charge for our products 
our ability to remain competitive depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our products or develop new products that are compatible with new hardware and operating systems 
we have no control over  and limited insight into  development efforts by third parties with respect to new hardware and operating systems and we may not be able to respond effectively or timely to such changes in the market 
in addition  we have limited resources and we must make strategic decisions as to the best allocation of our resources to position ourselves for changes in our markets 
we may from time to time allocate resources to projects or markets that do not develop as rapidly or fully as we expect 
we may fail to allocate resources to third party products or to markets that are more successful than we anticipate 
introduction of new operating systems may adversely affect our financial results and stock price 
the inclusion of security or virus protection tools in new operating systems and hardware packages could adversely affect our sales 
for example  the inclusion of features by microsoft in new or upcoming versions of windows  such as windows xp  which directly compete with our products may decrease or delay the demand for certain of our products  including those currently under development and products specifically intended for windows xp 
our financial results and our stock price declined significantly following the releases of windows  windows and windows the release of future editions of windows  including windows xp in our december quarter  could adversely affect our financial results and stock price 
additionally  as hardware vendors incorporate additional server based network management and security tools into network operating systems  the demand may decrease for some of our products  including those currently under development 
our earnings and stock price are subject to significant fluctuations 
due to many factors  including those noted in this section  our earnings and stock price have been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
there have been previous quarters in which we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
this may occur again in the future 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results have affected our stock price in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors  the trading price of shares of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of announcements and releases of new or enhanced versions of our products and product upgrades  the introduction of competitive products by existing or new competitors  reduced demand for any given product  seasonality in the end of period buying patterns of foreign and domestic software markets  and the market s transition between new releases of operating systems 
in addition to the foregoing factors  the risk of quarterly fluctuations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our net revenues has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter 
most resellers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter 
in addition  many enterprise customers negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because these two groups are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
in addition  these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and analysts 
we face risks associated with our foreign operations 
a significant portion of our net revenues  manufacturing costs and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and general uncertainty with each country s political and economic structure 
we must effectively adapt to changes in the dynamic technological environment 
we are increasingly focused on the internet security market  which  in turn is dependent on further acceptance and increased use of the internet 
the following critical issues concerning the use of the internet remain unresolved and may affect the market for our products and the use of the internet as a medium to distribute or support our software products and the functionality of some of our products security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service  and potential tax or other government regulations 
in addition  new technologies  such as non pc based internet access devices and handheld organizers are gaining acceptance 
we must adapt to these changing technological demands 
if we are unable to timely assimilate changes brought about by the internet and non pc based environments  our future net revenues and operating results could be adversely affected 
the results of our research and development efforts are uncertain 
we believe that we will need to incur significant research and development expenditures to remain competitive 
the products we are currently developing or may develop in the future may not be technologically successful 
in addition  the length of our product development cycle has generally been greater than we originally expected and we are likely to experience delays in future product development 
if our resulting products are not technologically successful  they may not achieve market acceptance or compete effectively with products of our competitors 
we are dependent upon certain distribution channels 
a large portion of our sales is made through the retail distribution channel  which is subject to events that cause unpredictability in consumer demand 
this increases the risk that we may not plan effectively for the future  which could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
our retail distribution customers also carry our competitors products 
these retail distributors may have limited capital to invest in inventory 
their decisions to purchase our products are partly a function of pricing  terms and special promotions offered by our competitors and other factors that we do not control and cannot predict 
our agreements with retail distributors are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated by them or by us without cause 
we would be adversely affected if companies in our chain of distributors chose to increase purchases from our competition relative to the amount they purchase from us 
some distributors and resellers have experienced financial difficulties in the past 
distributors that account for a significant portion of our sales may experience financial difficulties in the future 
if these distributors do experience financial difficulties and we are unable to move their inventories to other distributors  we may experience reduced sales or increased write offs  which would adversely affect our operating results 
product returns may negatively affect our net revenues 
product returns can occur when we introduce upgrades and new versions of products or when distributors or retailers have excess inventories  subject to various contractual limitations 
our return policy allows distributors  subject to these contractual limitations  to return purchased productsin exchange for new products or for credit towards future purchases 
end users may return our products through dealers and distributors for a full refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase 
we estimate and maintain reserves for such product returns which to date have been materially consistent with our actual experience 
future returns could  however  exceed the reserves we have established  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we depend on internal communications systems that may be disrupted 
our order management and product shipping centers are geographically dispersed 
a business disruption could occur as a result of natural disasters  intermittent power shortages in the state of california  or the interruption in service by communications carriers 
if our communications between these centers are disrupted  particularly at the end of a fiscal quarter  we may suffer an unexpected shortfall in net revenues and a resulting adverse impact on our operating results 
communications and internet connectivity disruptions may also cause delays in customer access to our internet based services or product sales 
we are exposed to general economic and market conditions and the current economic downturn may adversely affect future revenue 
our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions and  in particular  market conditions in the software and computer industries 
our operating results could be adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable global economic conditions and reduced spending 
if these economic conditions do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in global economic conditions  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our financial results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  or other product liability claims  or other claims incidental to our business 
we are currently involved in a number of lawsuits 
for a discussion of our current litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
we intend to defend all of these lawsuits vigorously 
however  it is possible that we could suffer an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these lawsuits  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
although infringement claims may ultimately prove to be without merit  they are expensive to defend and may consume our resources or divert our attention from day to day operations 
if a third party alleges that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
if we engage in litigation and the third party is found to have a valid patent claim against us and a license is not available on reasonable terms  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the trend toward consolidation in the software industry could impede our ability to compete effectively 
consolidation is underway among companies in the software industry as firms seek to offer more extensive suites of software products and broader arrays of software solutions 
changes resulting from this consolidation may negatively impact our competitive condition 
in addition  to the extent that we seek to expand our product lines and skills and capacity through acquisitions  the trend toward consolidation may result in our encountering competition  and paying higher prices  for acquired businesses 
we must attract and retain personnel while competition for personnel in our industry is intense 
competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry is intense 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled management  marketing and technical personnel 
to accomplish this  we believe that we must provide personnel with a competitive compensation package  including stock options  which require ongoing stockholder approval 
such approval may not be forthcoming and  as a result  we may be impaired in our efforts to attract necessary personnel 
our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be adequately protected from all unauthorized uses 
we regard our software and underlying technology as proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws 
third parties may copy aspects of our products or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or develop similar technology independently 
all of our products are protected by copyright laws  and we have a number of patents and patent applications pending 
we may not achieve the desired protection from  and third parties may design around  our patents 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford limited practical protection 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
our products are complex and are operated in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures or bugs may occur when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products often are installed and used in large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures or bugs in our products 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delays or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
our customers computer environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
despite testing by us and by others  errors  failures or bugs may not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments 
errors  failures or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or claims by customers or others 
alleviating such problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and resources and could cause interruptions  delays or cessation of our product licensing  which would adversely affect results of operations 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
like many companies in the software industry  technical support costs comprise a significant portion of our operating costs and expenses 
over the short term  we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
further  customer demand for these services could cause increases in the costs of providing such services and adversely affect our operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of march   the fair market value of our financial instruments with exposure to interest risk was approximately us million and euro million 
sensitivity analysis for a six month horizon was performed on our floating rate and fixed rate financial investments and floating rate liabilities 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments and floating rate liabilities of less than million 
for the euro investments  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of less than euro million 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in international currencies through our worldwide operations 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program  utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts  or forward contracts  of one fiscal month duration to hedge various foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts to mitigate the risk of material foreign currency transaction losses 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
at the end of each fiscal month  all non functional currency assets and liabilities are revalued using the month end spot rate of the maturing forward contracts and the realized gains and losses are recorded and included in net income as a component of other income expense 
we believe that the use of forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
however  significant changes in exchange rates may still result in adverse effects on our operating results 
we use sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair market values of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analyses consist of all of our foreign currency assets and liabilities and all derivative instruments  principally forward contracts 
the sensitivity analyses assesses the risk of loss in fair market values from the impact of hypothetical changes of instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rates yield curves on market sensitive instruments over a six month horizon 
as of march   the notional amount of our forward contracts was approximately us million 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in our forward contracts by approximately us million and an increase in our forward contracts by approximately us million  respectively 
this quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
as of march   the fair value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies was approximately us million 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our investments by approximately us million and a decrease in the fair value of our investments by approximately us million  respectively
