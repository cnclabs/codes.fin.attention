assumed reinsurance 
in addition to its direct business  the company reinsures risks underwritten by other insurers 
as an assuming reinsurer  the company essentially acts as an insurer of the direct writer for a portion of its insurance risks  as specified under the terms of the reinsurance agreement 
the company s assumed reinsurance consists primarily of mpl  lpl  and a group a h business written on an excess of loss and a quota share basis 
under excess of loss contracts  the company assumes risks over a certain limit on a per loss basis 
under the company s quota share agreements  it assumes a pro rata portion of each underlying risk  up to and including in some cases 
the company s assumed reinsurance contracts are treaty agreements whereby terms are set in advance and the underlying individual contracts of the ceding company are automatically assumed as they are written 
effective january   the company s insurance subsidiaries entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with pri  to assume the death  disability and retirement risks under pri s claims made insurance policies in exchange for cash and investments 
during  a valuation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap of the underlying liability was completed and a deferred credit in the amount of million was recognized 
the deferred credit  which will be amortized into income over years  represents the difference between the gaap valuation of the underlying liabilities and the initial premium received 
the liability was calculated using benefit assumptions and elements of pension actuarial models ie mortality  morbidity  retirement  interest and inflation rate assumptions 
regulation 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive state regulatory oversight in florida and missouri  where its four insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  and in the other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 
the insurance laws in each state regulate insurance holding company structures  including the company and its subsidiaries 
each insurance company in a holding company structure is required to register with its domiciliary department of insurance the department of insurance and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company structure that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the structure 
pursuant to these laws  the department of insurance may examine the company  and or fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex at any time and require disclosure of and or approval of material transactions involving any insurance subsidiary of the company  such as extraordinary dividends from fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex 
all transactions within the holding company structure affecting the company s insurance subsidiaries must be fair and reasonable 
florida insurance laws provide that no person may acquire  directly or indirectly  five percent or more of the voting securities of a domiciled insurance company unless such person has obtained the prior written approval of the florida department of insurance for such acquisition 
any purchaser of five percent or more of the company s outstanding common stock will generally be presumed to have acquired control of the insurance company 
in lieu of obtaining such prior approval  a purchaser owning less than ten percent of the outstanding shares of the company  fpic  or apac may file a disclaimer of affiliation and control with the florida department of insurance 
missouri insurance laws generally provide that no person may acquire  directly or indirectly  ten percent or more of the voting securities of intermed or interlex unless such person has obtained the prior written approval of the missouri department of insurance for such acquisition 
since fpic  apac  intermed  and interlex are insurance companies  the departments of insurance in florida and missouri are their principal supervisors and regulators 
however  these companies are also subject to supervision and regulation in the other states where they transact business in relation to numerous aspects of their business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is to insure the financial stability of the insurance companies for the protection of policyholders 
insurance companies are required to file detailed annual reports with the supervisory agencies in each state in which they do business  and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time 
the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad regulatory powers relative to granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating trade practices  required statutory financial statements and prescribing the types and amount of investments permitted 
although premium rate regulations vary among states and lines of insurance  such regulations require approval by each state regulator of the rates and policies to be used in its state 
in march  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles project the codification as the naic supported basis of accounting 
codification affects all statutory financial statements issued after the adoption date of january  the codification was approved with a provision allowing for discretion by each state s department of insurance in determining appropriate statutory accounting for insurers 
accordingly  such discretion will continue to allow prescribed or permitted accounting practices that may differ from state to state 
the codification does not affect the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company expects that statutory surplus after adoption will continue to be in excess of the current regulatory and risk based capital requirements 
the insurance subsidiaries of the company are subject to assessment by the financial guaranty associations in the states in which they conduct business for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies of insolvent insurers 
generally  these associations can assess member insurers on the basis of written premiums in their particular states 
the gramm leach bliley act of the act established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the federal bank holding company act framework to permit a bank holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance  through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
generally  the act i repeals historical restrictions on  and eliminates many federal and state law barriers to  affiliations among commercial banks  securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  ii provides a uniform framework for the functional regulation of commercial banks  insurance companies and securities firms  iii broadens the activities that may be conducted by national banks and derivatively  state banks  banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies  and their financial subsidiaries  and iv addresses a variety of other legal and regulatory issues affecting both day to day operations and long term activities of insurance companies and other financial institutions 
the insurance industry is under continuous review by congress  state legislatures and state and federal regulatory agencies 
from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed for the insurance industry  some of which could have an adverse effect on individual insurers or reinsurers 
among the proposals that have in the past been  or are at present being  considered are the possible introduction of state and federal limits on certain damages for mpl claims as well as federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers 
the company is unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted  the form in which any such proposals would be adopted  or the impact  if any  such adoption would have on the company  although such impact could be material 
competition 
the mpl insurance markets in florida and missouri are highly competitive from the perspective of pricing and the number of competitors writing business 
several companies offer similar products at lower premium rates than the company 
in addition  more competitors may enter the company s markets in the future 
the company believes that the number of healthcare entities that insure their affiliated physicians through self insurance may begin to increase and affect both its florida and missouri based operations 
many of the mpl insurers are substantially larger and have considerably greater resources than the company 
additionally  several of these insurers have received am best ratings that are higher than the company s insurance subsidiaries ratings of a excellent 
in addition  because a substantial portion of the company s products are marketed through independent insurance agencies  all of which represent more than one company  the company faces competition within each agency in its own agency system 
the company competes within this environment on the basis of its excellent relationship with the medical and professional communities it serves 
in florida  name recognition  service reputation  medical society endorsements  physician board of directors  agency force and program development have all contributed to helping the company maintain its number of insureds 
furthermore  the company believes it has been successful by target marketing groups and specialties that exhibit better than average risks and believes that its marketing success has allowed it to improve the quality and profitability of its overall business 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its business in florida are service  name recognition  and price  and that it is competitive in florida in all of these areas 
the company enjoys strong name recognition in florida by virtue of having been organized by  and operated for the principal benefit of  florida physicians 
the services offered to insureds of the company  as well as the healthcare community in general  are intended to promote name recognition and to maintain and improve loyalty among the insureds of the company 
mpl insurance offered by fpic has the exclusive endorsement of both the fma and the fda  and is also endorsed by various county and state medical societies 
in both missouri and kansas  intermed and interlex compete with regional and national companies 
in  the last year for which statistics are available from the missouri department of insurance  there were fifty three companies writing medical malpractice insurance for physicians and surgeons in the state 
the top five writers had of the market 
the largest market share was 
intermed was the sixth largest writer in the state in and had a market share of 
in  nineteen companies wrote lpl insurance in the state of missouri according to the latest statistics available from the missouri department of insurance 
one company  sponsored by the missouri bar association  had a market share of 
interlex  which commenced operations in october  had a market share of and was the second largest writer 
a number of hospitals in missouri have purchased the medical practices of fee for service physicians and hired the physicians as employees of the hospital or a corporate entity affiliated with the hospital 
a number of such physicians formerly purchased their own professional liability insurance through smaller insurance companies such as intermed 
as a result of industry consolidation  many of the hospitals purchasing the practices of physicians have become self insured or sought professional liability insurance from professional liability carriers with capital and surplus greater than that of intermed and at premiums lower than those currently offered by intermed 
in general  local carriers that have been able to maintain strong customer loyalty dominate the mpl market in other states 
the same targeted specialty and claims free approach developed in florida is being used in these other states 
the company is recruiting and developing an agency force to expand its market  provide service  and develop name recognition 
marketing 
the company markets its mpl policies in florida and missouri primarily through independent agencies 
the company also sells insurance products directly through its subsidiary  fpic agency  inc the agency 
the insurance products that are sold directly by the agency are a result of direct requests from physicians 
the company markets its lpl policies in missouri primarily through a direct sales force 
in october of  the company signed an agreement with charlton manley  inc to serve as the state administrator for all marketing and underwriting functions in the state of kansas 
during  the direct sales force produced approximately of lpl premiums written 
an integral part of the company s marketing strategy is targeting sectors of the mpl industry that it believes generate above average operating profits 
the company has identified certain medical specialties and claims free physicians as sectors in which it wishes to increase its market share 
the company provides comprehensive risk management services  as a service to its insureds  designed to heighten their awareness of situations giving rise to potential loss exposures  to educate them on ways to improve their medical practice procedures and to assist them in implementing risk modification measures 
in addition  the company conducts surveys for hospitals and large medical groups to review their practice procedures 
complete reports that specify areas of the insured s medical practice that may need attention are provided to the policyholder on a confidential basis 
the company also presents and participates in periodic seminars with medical societies and other groups at which pertinent subjects are presented 
these educational offerings are designed to increase risk awareness and the effectiveness of various medical professionals 
underwriting 
as part of the mpl underwriting process  the company utilizes the data collected by the states of florida and missouri  which includes a record of all mpl claims paid information that insurers are required to report 
when applications are received from physicians for mpl insurance  the company reviews this database to verify the physician s claims paid record 
if a physician has an excessive claims paid history  the application is denied 
all other applicants are reviewed on the basis of the physician s educational background  residency experience  practice history and comments received from personal references 
annually  the company s underwriting department reexamines each insured before coverage is renewed  including verifying that the insured s license is current and that any reported claims for the insured were within acceptable limits 
in underwriting lpl insurance  the company s underwriters use an approach similar to the process for underwriting mpl as described above 
the company has an underwriting committee composed of lawyers to provide assistance to this process 
the committee is geographically broad based  and in most instances  has knowledge of applicants and renewals 
this structure has enabled the company to maintain high underwriting standards 
the underwriting of the company s other insurance products is conducted in conjunction with external underwriters 
with respect to these products  the company receives applications from prospective insureds 
after a review of the information contained in such applications  the company forwards them to an external underwriter 
the external underwriter performs review procedures for each application and consults with the company on the amount of premium to charge each insured 
claims administration 
the company s claims department is responsible for the supervision of claims investigation  the establishment of case reserves  case management  development of the defense strategy and the coordination and control of attorneys engaged by the company 
the claims department has complete settlement authority for claims filed against the company s insureds 
the company s policy is and has been to refuse settlement and to defend aggressively all claims that appear to have no merit 
in those instances where claims may have merit  the claims department attempts to settle the case as expeditiously as possible 
the company believes that it has developed relationships with attorneys in florida and missouri who have significant experience in the defense of mpl lpl claims and who are able to defend in an aggressive  cost efficient manner the claims against the company s insureds 
reinsurance 
the company follows the customary industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its business 
the company cedes to reinsurers a portion of its risks and pays a fee based upon premiums received on all policies subject to such reinsurance 
insurance is ceded principally to reduce the company s net liability on individual risks and to provide protection against large losses 
although reinsurance does not legally discharge the company from its primary liability  it does make the reinsurer liable to the company to the extent of risks ceded 
for mpl  lpl  and professional and comprehensive general liability insurance written during and prior  the company reinsured risks in excess of thousand per loss  except on the company s anesthesiology program in which the company reinsured risks in excess of thousand 
the company reinsured risks associated with these policies under treaties pursuant to which reinsurers agree to assume those risks insured by the company in excess of its individual risk retention level and up to its maximum individual policy limit offered 
during  the company changed its ceded reinsurance program to reinsure risks in excess of thousand per loss subject to an annual aggregate deductible of 
million  except for the company s anesthesiology program in which the company reinsured risks in excess of thousand 
in regards to the annual aggregate deductible  the company retains the first million of losses that would otherwise qualify for reinsurance under the agreement 
in return  the company receives an approximate dollar for dollar reduction in the rate its reinsurers would have charged for the additional risks they are assuming in connection with the reduction in the company s per loss retention from thousand to thousand 
reinsurance is placed under reinsurance treaties and agreements with a number of individual companies and syndicates to mitigate the concentration of credit risk 
the company relies on reinsurance brokers and intermediaries to assist in analysis of the credit quality of its reinsurers 
the company also requires reinsurers that are not authorized to do business in florida or missouri to post a letter of credit or establish a trust account to secure their reinsurance recoverables 
under florida and missouri laws  in the event the company has the opportunity to settle a claim within policy limits but fails to do so  and a judgment is rendered against a policyholder for an amount exceeding the policy limit  the company may be charged with bad faith in failing to settle 
thus  in such a case  the company may be held responsible for an amount exceeding the policy limit or for extra contractual damages 
the company s primary reinsurance contracts include coverage for policies with limits equal to or greater than million for which the claim exceeds policy limits  or is for extra contractual damages 
in the past five years  the company has not paid a claim  including bad faith claims  in excess of million 
effective january   the company has obtained reinsurance covering claims in excess of million 
liability for loss and loss adjustment expense lae 
the determination of the total liability for loss and lae is based upon a projection of ultimate losses through an actuarial analysis of the claims history of the company  subject to adjustments deemed appropriate by the company due to differing or changing circumstances 
included in its claims history are losses and lae paid by the company in prior periods and case reserves for anticipated losses and lae developed by the company s claims department as claims are reported and investigated 
the company relies primarily on such historical loss experience in determining reserve levels on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience despite the uncertainties in loss cost trends and the delays in reporting and settling claims 
as additional information becomes available  the estimates reflected in earlier liabilities for loss and lae may be revised 
any increase in the liability  including amounts for insured events of prior years  could have an adverse effect on the company s results for the period in which the adjustments are made 
the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate losses on the basis of past experience have grown significantly in recent years  principally as a result of judicial expansion of liability standards and expansive interpretations of insurance contracts 
these uncertainties may be further affected by  among other factors  changes in the rate of inflation and changes in the propensities of individuals to file claims 
mpl insurance is a long tail line of business for which the initial loss and lae estimates may be adversely impacted by events occurring long after the reporting of the claim  such as sudden severe inflation or adverse judicial or legislative decisions 
the company utilizes both its staff and independent actuaries in establishing its reserves 
the company s independent actuaries review the company s liabilities for loss and lae one or more times each year and prepare a report that includes a recommended level of reserves 
the company considers this recommendation as well as other factors such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of losses  loss retention levels and premium rates  in establishing the amount of its liability for loss and lae 
the company continually refines its estimates as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
the company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of the current period 
the following table sets forth in thousands the development of the company s liability for loss and lae  net of reinsurance recovered or recoverable  for the year period ended december  year ended december  balance sheet liability            reestimated liability as of one year later           two years later          three years later         four years later        five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  cumulative paid as of one year later           two years later          three years later         four years later        five years later       six years later      seven years later     eight years later    nine years later   ten years later  deficiency redundancy           deficiency redundancy the following table sets forth in thousands an analysis of the company s liability for losses and lae and provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability  net of reinsurance  for the years ended december   and net loss and lae liability  at the beginning of period    loss and lae of entity acquired   provisions for losses and lae occurring in the current period    increase decrease in estimated losses and lae for claims occurring in prior periods    total incurred during current period    losses and lae payments relating to the current period    losses and lae payments relating to prior periods    total paid during current period    net loss and lae liability  at end of period    gross loss and lae liability at end of period    reinsurance recoverable at end of period    net loss and lae liability at end of period    incurred losses and lae for claims relating to prior years reflects the change in the estimate of the liability charged or credited to earnings in each year with respect to the liabilities established as of the beginning of that year 
information regarding incurred losses and lae is revealed over time and the estimates of the liability are revised accordingly  resulting in gains or losses in the period revisions are made 
the company s management closely monitors the adequacy of its liability for loss and lae incurred and underlying claims trends  including having the company s outside actuaries perform calculations periodically 
incurred losses and lae related to prior years  net of reinsurance recoveries  was million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in prior years liability for loss and lae includes a reserve strengthening resulting from the identification of certain unfavorable trends in the underlying claim data with respect to fpic s core physician s mpl business including an increase in the rate of claims closed with indemnity payment  a slow down in the overall closure rate of pending claims  and an increase in the severity of indemnity payments made during relating to prior periods 
the company and its outside consulting actuary further analyzed these trends and determined that additional reserves were required 
as a result  the company increased its liability for loss and lae by approximately million 
for additional information  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the net reductions of million and million in incurred loss and lae related to prior years for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  are the result of reevaluations of the liability for loss and lae and reflect overall favorable underwriting results and lower than expected losses and lae 
third party administration tpa segment principal business 
the company  through mccreary and emi  is a provider of tpa services to self insured and fully insured employer groups 
the lines of insurance that the company primarily administers are group accident and health  workers compensation  general liability  and property 
the company also provides administration services for emerging managed care organizations and an ambulance service organization aso 
the company primarily generates revenue from fees charged for the administration of self insured employer groups 
the company does not assume insurance risks on this service  each employer assumes this risk and the company places any desired excess coverage with various insurers and reinsurers 
commission income is derived from the placement of this excess coverage 
the company also offers premium administration  claims adjudication and commission accounting services to fully insured groups 
the revenue for these services is calculated as a percentage of premiums 
the company provides tpa services to eighty five clients  five of which accounted for approximately of the company s total claims administration fees generated by the tpa segment 
approximately was derived from the single largest client 
regulation 
the company and its tpa subsidiaries are subject to state regulation from the department of insurance and department of labor in the states in which they are licensed 
state regulation provides that each company conducting business in that state furnish annual reports of operational activity to supervisory agencies 
such agencies may examine the company at any time 
as noted earlier  the insurance industry is under continuous review by congress  state legislatures and state and federal regulatory agencies 
from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed for the insurance industry  some of which could have an effect on the tpa business 
among the proposals that have in the past been  or are at present being  considered are the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa privacy issues  hipaa non discrimination rules and patient bill of rights laws 
the company is unable to predict if the regulatory or legislative proposals will have a material impact on the tpa business 
competition 
the tpa industry is one of constant change 
each year the industry appears to be under the threat of elimination  however because of innovation  flexibility and willingness to offer services demanded  the industry has survived and the number of tpas and amount of business administrated by the tpas continues to grow 
the company s tpas are highly competitive with regards to prices and services 
the company believes the principle competitors of its tpa business in the group a h market are other similar tpas  including several larger organizations  many of which may offer services the company does not offer  as well as insurance companies that compete directly with alternative risk markets  including self insurance programs administered by the tpas 
while the company believes its tpas enjoy strong name recognition and a good service reputation  it also recognizes that access to the stop loss market in placing the reinsurance for the self funded groups is a major factor and perhaps the greatest factor is some cases in obtaining and retaining clients 
the amount of business in the stop loss market has decreased while the pricing of reinsurance has increased 
this has resulted in insurance companies being able to price group a h insurance at a lower price than is available through self funding 
in addition  mccreary provides claims administration services for an aso through its subsidiary emi 
claims are generated by members of a national health maintenance organization hmo 
the aso in turn has an agreement with a software organization to maintain the eligibility of hmo members in addition to providing claims processing software to mccreary 
during  the software organization acquired a tpa 
while it is possible that the aso could transfer claims processing to the tpa owned by the software organization  emi has a strong working relationship with the aso and does not believe such a transfer will occur during the coming year 
in regards to workers compensation and property markets  the stop loss market has also increased pricing 
however  this has not affected the self funded workers compensation and property market as much as the group a h market 
in addition  the commission revenue associated with the placement of property insurance has increased accordingly 
the tpas also enjoy a strong name recognition and loyalty among its client base that has resulted in maintaining a long term client base 
marketing 
the company primarily markets its tpa services in florida and new mexico  however it is licensed in ten additional states 
the company may sell services directly or operate through agents and brokers 
the company s marketing strategy includes superior service  competitive pricing and delivery of support services 
the company s plan is to focus geographically with an emphasis in florida and to participate in various periodic seminars with governmental boards as well as other groups at which pertinent subjects are presented 
these educational offerings are designed to increase the awareness of available tpa services 
the tpas will continue to use agents and brokers to receive requests for proposals as well as utilize various services in which proposals are listed
