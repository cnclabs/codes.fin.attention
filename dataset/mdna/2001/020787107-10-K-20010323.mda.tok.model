item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general founded in  the company is an it professional services firm specializing in network design  operation  management  and security  offering related products and services to fortune and other large and mid sized companies located primarily in the new york to philadelphia corridor 
as a result of the company s shift in focus to the professional services market  the company derived of its revenue from assisting its clients in sourcing it products  down from approximately of total revenue in during the same period  the percentage of revenue related to services has increased from approximately in to approximately in the company anticipates that this trend will continue in except for the mta contract entered into in december  there are no ongoing written commitments by customers to purchase products from the company and all product sales are made on a purchase order basis 
as the market for it products has matured  price competition has intensified and is likely to continue to intensify 
during and  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations were adversely affected by such continued product pricing pressure and by a significant reduction in product purchase orders from the company s customers 
in addition  the company s gross profits  margins and results of operations could be adversely affected by a disruption in the company s sources of product supply 
the company offers enterprise network management  information security  internet related  emobile solutions  applications development  professional development  help desk  and workstation support services 
services and support revenue is recognized as such services are performed 
most of the company s services are billed on a time and materials basis 
the company s professional development and services are fee based on a per course basis 
generally  the company s service arrangements with its customers may be terminated by such customers with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
the most significant cost relating to the services component of the company s business is personnel costs which consist of salaries  benefits and payroll related expenses 
thus  the financial performance of the company s service business is based primarily upon billing margins billable hourly rates less the costs to the company of such service personnel on an hourly basis and utilization rates billable hours divided by paid hours 
the future success of the services component of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain high utilization rates at profitable billing margins 
the competition for quality technical personnel remains strong  resulting in increased personnel costs for the company 
in  the company faced reduced manpower requirements due to completion of yk projects and reduced staffing requirements at certain client accounts  resulting in a reduction of positions 
adjustments to the size of the company s workforce may continue to be necessary in order for the company to realize maximum operating efficiency while continuing to meet the needs of its clients 
the company may receive manufacturer rebates resulting from equipment sales 
in addition  the company receives volume discounts and other incentives from certain of its suppliers 
except for products in transit or products awaiting configuration at a company facility  the company generally does not maintain large inventory balances 
the company s primary vendors have announced or instituted changes in their price protection and inventory management programs as a direct result of changes in such policies by manufacturers 
specifically  they have announced that they will i limit price protection to that provided by the manufacturer  generally less than days  rather than the unlimited protection previously available  and ii restrict product returns  other than defective returns  to a percentage the percentage varies depending on the vendor and when the return is made of product purchased  during a defined period  at the lower of the invoiced price or the current price  subject to the specific manufacturer s requirements and restrictions 
at the present time  the company does not believe these changes in the vendor policies will have a material impact on its business 
other than changes in such price protection and return policies  the company is unaware that any of its suppliers or manufacturers have changed or intend to further change these programs 
there can be no assurances that any such rebates  discounts or incentives will continue at historical levels  if at all 
further adverse modification  restriction or reduction in such programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company recognizes sales of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  which takes place either when the products are shipped or upon delivery to the customer based upon the sales terms of the respective transactions 
consulting and other services and support revenue is recognized when the applicable services are rendered 
the company recognizes revenue on service contracts on a prorated basis over the life of the contracts 
revenues under the metropolitan transit authority contract the mta contract are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on total costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
prepaid fees related to the company s training programs are deferred and amortized to income over the duration of the applicable training program 
deferred revenue is included in accrued expenses and represents the unearned portion of each service contract and the unamortized balance of prepaid training fees received as of the balance sheet date 
the company s cost of sales includes primarily  in the case of product sales  the cost to the company of products acquired for resale  and in the case of services and support revenue  salaries and related expenses for billable technical personnel 
the company s selling  general and administrative costs consist of operating expenses  including personnel and related costs  such as sales commissions earned by employees involved in the sales of it products  services and support 
personnel costs also include direct sales  marketing and sales support  and general and administrative personnel costs 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
during the last three fiscal years  the gross margins earned on services and support sales increased from for  to for  and decreased to for the company believes that its ability to provide a broad range of technical services  coupled with its long term relationships with large customers  provides the company with the potential to grow the services component of its business 
however  in the near term  the company believes that product sales will continue to generate a significant percentage of the company s gross profit 
the company s net sales  gross profit  operating income and net income and losses have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and are expected to do so in the future 
many factors  some of which are not within the company s control  have contributed and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include the short term nature of the company s customers commitments  patterns of capital spending by customers  the timing  size  and mix of product and service orders and deliveries  the timing and size of new projects  pricing changes in response to various competitive factors  market factors affecting the availability of qualified technical personnel  timing and customer acceptance of new product and service offerings  changes in trends affecting outsourcing of it services  disruption in sources of supply  changes in product  personnel  and other operating costs  and industry and general economic conditions 
operating results have been and may in the future also be affected by the cost  timing and other effects of acquisitions  including the mix of revenues of acquired companies 
the company believes  therefore  that past operating results and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future operating performance 
the company s operating results have been and will continue to be impacted by changes in technical personnel billing and utilization rates 
many of the company s costs  particularly costs associated with services and support revenue  such as administrative support personnel and facilities costs  are primarily fixed costs 
the company s overall expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
in december  the company entered into a four year  million contract with the mta to furnish and install local and wide area computer network components including network and telecommunications hardware  software and cabling throughout the mta s over locations 
the aggregate amount of this contract was subsequently increased to million 
the company is the prime contractor on this project and is responsible for project management  systems procurement  and installation 
the work is grouped in contiguous locations and payment is predicated upon achieving specific milestone events 
in the event of default  in addition to all other remedies at law  the mta reserves the right to terminate the services of the company and complete the mta contract itself at the company s cost 
in the event of unexcused delay by the company  the company may be obligated to pay  as liquidated damages  the sum of to per day  per site 
while the company is currently performing in accordance with the contract terms  there can be no assurance that any such events of default or unexcused delays will not occur 
in addition  the mta contract is a fixed unit price contract  and the quantities are approximate  for which the mta has expressly reserved the right  for each item  to direct the amount of equipment be increased  decreased  or omitted entirely on days notice 
the mta has the right to suspend the work on days notice for up to days and or terminate the contract  at any time  on notice  paying only for the work performed to the date of termination 
the project is subject to the prevailing wage rate and classification for telecommunications workers  managed by the new york city controller s office  over which the company has no control  and which is generally adjusted in june of each year and may be so adjusted in the future 
the company has performed services and supplied products to the mta since the inception of the mta contract 
the work performed to date at mta sites has required greater than originally estimated labor and other costs to complete 
in may  the company submitted a formal request to the mta for equitable adjustment in the amount of approximately million and for a time extension 
this request was supplemented with a further submission in october in january  the project manager for the mta contract denied the company s request  thereby triggering the company s right under the contract to appeal the project manager s denial to the mta s dispute resolution office the dro 
the company filed its notice of appeal with the dro in february  and pursuant to the dro s request  filed further written submissions and participated in an arbitral session with the dro subsequent thereto 
in november  the dro rendered a written decision denying in full the company s request for equitable adjustment and time extension 
pursuant to the terms of the mta contract  in march  the company appealed the dro s denial of the company s request to the new york supreme court under an article proceeding 
on july   the mta advised the company of a determination by the bureau of labor law hereinafter  the bureau of the new york city comptroller s office  communicated to the mta by letter from the bureau dated june   that  as of july   the labor classification for all low voltage cabling carrying voice  data  video or any combination thereof is electrician 
the bureau s determination is based on a new york state supreme court appellate division decision dated may  the workers currently and historically used by the company to perform cabling work have been classified as telecommunications workers 
the company believes it is probable that the bureau s determination will apply to the company s cabling activities under the contract  thereby likely requiring the reclassification of its telecommunications workers as electricians retroactive to july  since the prevailing wage for electricians is substantially higher than that for telecommunications workers  the company expects to incur materially increased labor costs as a result of the bureau s determination 
on october   the mta project manager denied the company s request for a change order to compensate the company for the increased costs it expects to incur in connection with the reclassification of certain of its telecommunications workers as electricians 
on january   the company initiated a dispute within the meaning of the applicable federal regulations governing the mta contract by filing a complaint with the united states department of labor 
in its complaint  the company requests that the department of labor adjudicate this dispute  and either issue a determination affirming that the prevailing wage rate for telecommunication workers  as originally specified by the mta  is the applicable rate for this project  or directing the mta to compensate the company for the change in wage classification made during the performance of the contract in violation of federal regulations 
by letter dated march   the department of labor advised the company that  without knowing which  if any  federal wage decision was included in the mta contract  it is unable to make a determination that any violation of federal labor law has occurred 
the company intends to seek clarification of the department s letter 
there can be no assurance the company will be successful  either in whole or in part  in its efforts 
historically  the company had estimated that project costs would approximate project revenues and  accordingly  had recognized no gross profit on the contract 
due to the determination by the bureau communicated to the company on july   as well as lower than anticipated gross margins on networking activities and higher than expected costs of completion  the company revised its estimated costs for the project during the second quarter 
as a result  in the second quarter of  the company took a charge of million for costs projected in excess of the contract value 
this charge represents the company s current estimated loss on the mta project 
for the years ended december  and  revenues recorded in connection with the mta contract amounted to approximately million and million  respectively

comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales decreased by  or million  from million in to million in product sales decreased by  or million  from million in to million in this decline in product sales was primarily attributable to two predominantly low margin product accounts  partially offset by increased business with other customers  as well as lower average selling prices due to increased competition and other product pricing pressures 
this trend has been accelerated by the ability of customers to purchase directly from certain manufacturers at discounted prices 
services and support revenue decreased by  or million  from million in to million in many of the services performed by the company in prior years such as desktop support services  configuration and installation were performed to support product sales

risk factors the company is focusing significant efforts on evolving its core business from a company relying mainly on sales of product to a professional services firm focusing primarily on network design and management 
the implementation of this strategy has resulted in reduced product sales and the pursuit of higher margin services revenue 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in effectuating this transition

the company s success depends upon its ability to recruit and retain qualified management  business development and technical personnel
