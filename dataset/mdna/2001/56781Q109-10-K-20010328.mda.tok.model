overview marimba is a leading provider of systems management software built for e business 
our products enable companies to expand their market reach  streamline business processes and strengthen relationships with customers  business partners and employees 
in january  we released our first version of castanet and since that time have continued to develop and market the castanet product line and enhance the core castanet infrastructure with additional castanet products 
in the first half of  marimba released two products in a new product line called timbale 
the timbale products are designed to address many of the server management challenges inherent in thin client and web commerce computing environments today 
the first timbale product  timbale for server management  was released for sale in march the second timbale product  timbale for windows terminal services  was released for sale in june during  revenues from the timbale products accounted for of total license revenues 
there can be no assurance that revenues from the timbale product line will grow in the future or that the timbale products will gain widespread market acceptance 
revenues to date have been derived primarily from the license of our castanet and timbale products and to a lesser extent from maintenance and support  consulting and training services 
customers who license our products generally purchase maintenance contracts  typically covering a month period 
additionally  customers may purchase consulting services  which is customarily billed by us at a fixed daily rate plus out of pocket expenses 
we also offer training services that are billed on a per student or per class session basis 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or multiyear license fees which are primarily derived from contracts with corporate customers and resellers 
we recognize license revenues after execution of a license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order and delivery of the product to end user customers  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the license fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and we have no remaining obligations with regard to installation or implementation of the software 
revenues on arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users  primarily resellers  are not recognized until the software is sold through to the end user 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenues are recognized when the fee is collected 
advanced payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the products are delivered  services are provided or obligations are met 
service revenues are comprised of revenues from maintenance agreements  consulting and training fees 
revenues from maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
we recognize service revenues from training and consulting as such services are delivered 
since inception  we have made substantial investments in sales  marketing and research and development to expand and enhance our product lines and increase the market awareness of marimba and our products 
we have incurred significant losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of approximately million at december  we believe that our success depends on further increasing our customer base and on growth in our market overall 
accordingly  we intend to continue to invest heavily in sales  marketing and research and development 
in view of the rapidly changing nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance  growth or financial results 
additionally  we do not believe that historical growth rates or profitability are necessarily sustainable  nor indicative of future growth or financial results 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues 
year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred compensation total operating expenses loss from operations interest income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in total revenues in increased million  or  from million in license revenues 
prior to the release of our timbale products  substantially all license revenues were derived from sales of our castanet products 
for the year ended december   revenues from sales of our timbale products accounted for approximately of total license revenues 
license revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in license revenues in increased million  or  from million in we attribute the year to year increases in license revenues to o increased product licenses sold  reflecting higher customer demand for our castanet products and in  the introduction of our timbale products  o additional sales to existing customers  and o growth of our sales organization 
service revenues 
service revenues include maintenance and support  consulting and training 
service revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in service revenues in increased million  or  from million in as a percentage of total revenues  service revenues were  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues was due primarily to increased revenues from customer maintenance contracts 
also  we increased our consulting service revenues as customers elected to utilize our consulting organization 
during  we expect service revenues to increase in absolute amount and as a percentage of total revenues 
an increased shift in our revenue mix toward services will negatively impact our gross margins  because service revenues have higher costs and therefore lower margins than license revenues 
costs of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the cost of third party software products that were either integrated into our products or resold by us 
cost of license revenues was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increases from to and to were due primarily to the increased costs of a third party product resold by us 
we expect cost of license revenues to increase in absolute dollar amount during  but to remain a relatively small percentage of total revenues 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues includes o salaries and related expenses of our customer support organization  o salaries and related expenses of our consultants for billable consulting engagements  o cost of third parties contracted to provide consulting services to our customers  and o an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
cost of service revenues was million  million and million in  and  representing  and of service revenue  respectively 
the year to year increases in absolute dollars of cost of service revenues were due primarily to growth in our customer support organization and an increase in consulting costs commensurate with the increase in consulting revenues 
our customer support organization had employees at december   employees at december  and grew to employees at december  we expect our cost of service revenues to increase as we continue to expand our customer support and consulting organizations 
since service revenues provide lower gross margins than license revenues  this expansion will negatively impact our gross margins if our license revenues do not significantly increase 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of o salaries and related costs of our engineering organization  o fees paid to third party consultants  and o an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
we believe that our success is dependent in large part on continued enhancement of our current products and the ability to develop new  technologically advanced products that meet the sophisticated requirements of our customers 
accordingly  we have increased our investment in research and development in each of the periods since inception 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in research and development expenses were due primarily to increases in engineering personnel and related costs 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar amount in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of o salaries and related costs of our sales and marketing organizations  o sales commissions  o costs of our marketing programs  including public relations  advertising  trade shows  collateral sales materials  our customer advisory council and seminars  o rent and facilities costs associated with our regional and international sales offices  and o an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses are due primarily to growth in our sales and marketing organizations  an increase in sales commissions as sales have increased  an increase in the number of regional sales offices and expansion of our marketing programs 
we increased the number of sales and marketing personnel from employees at december   to employees at december  and employees at december  marimba also increased the number of sales offices from seven at december   to eight at december  and nine at december  we expect to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing in order to grow revenues and expand our brand awareness 
consequently  we expect to increase the absolute dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of o costs of our finance  human resources and legal services organizations  o third party legal and other professional services fees  and o an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the increase in were the settlement of our patent disputes with novadigm  inc  an increase in the bad debt provision of approximately million and growth of our administrative organization in support of our overall growth 
we increased our general and administrative personnel from at december   to at december  and at december  deferred compensation 
we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million in  representing the difference between the exercise prices of options granted to acquire  shares of common stock during and the deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the grant dates 
in addition  we granted options to purchase common stock in april for which we recorded additional deferred compensation of approximately million 
in  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million  net of reduction of  due to cancelled shares  which represented the intrinsic value of certain stock awards 
deferred compensation is being amortized over the vesting periods of the options and stock on a graded vesting method 
we amortized deferred compensation expense of million  million and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
this compensation expense relates to options awarded to individuals in all operating expense categories 
the amortization of deferred compensation  net of reductions of  in due to cancelled shares  will approximate million in and  in interest income  net interest income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments offset by interest expenses associated with our capital leases and equipment advances 
interest income  net was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the increases in interest income  net  relate primarily to increased invested cash balances from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering in april provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december   consists of state income and franchise taxes and foreign taxes 
for the years ended december  and  our provision for income taxes is comprised entirely of foreign taxes 
no provision for federal taxes has been recorded because we have experienced operating losses from inception through as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had a federal research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately  at that date 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations contained in the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and credits before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and and million of short term and long term investments in marketable securities  respectively 
in april  we sold shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  generating net proceeds of approximately million after offering expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  reflects primarily the sale of investment instruments  while net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflects the investment of approximately million of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in marketable securities 
proceeds from other issuances of common stock of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and are comprised primarily of employee exercises of stock options 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  is the result of the net loss for the year and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects an increase in deferred revenue offset by our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable 
marimba leases its office facilities under various noncancellable operating lease agreements 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases for the period through will be approximately million 
we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  cash generated from operations  if any  may not be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
we may therefore need to sell additional equity or raise funds by other means 
any additional financings  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas  as amended  establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
we adopted fas effective january  because we currently hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities  we do not believe that the adoption of fas  as amended  will have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
this summarizes certain areas of the staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements 
we believe that our current revenue recognition policies comply with sab in march  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb no 
fin 
fin clarifies the application of apb and  among other issues clarifies the following the definition of an employee for purposes of applying apb  the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards  and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
fin is effective july   but certain conclusions in fin cover specific events that occurred after either december  or january  the application of fin has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
other factors affecting operating results  liquidity and capital resources the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
for more information regarding the forward looking statements contained in this report  see the introductory paragraph to part i on page above 
our limited operating history may prevent us from achieving success in our business we were founded in february and have a limited operating history that may prevent us from achieving success in our business 
the revenues and income potential of our business and market are unproven 
we will encounter challenges and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not successfully address any of these challenges and the failure to do so would seriously harm our business and operating results 
in addition  because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we have incurred losses and may incur future losses our failure to significantly increase our revenues would seriously harm our business and operating results 
except for the second quarter of  we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since our inception 
there is no assurance that we will reach sustained profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to significantly increase our research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to significantly increase our quarterly revenues to offset these increasing expenses and return to profitability 
we may not be able to sustain our recent revenue growth rates 
in fact  we may not have any revenue growth  and our revenues could decline 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results and absence of significant backlog our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
in the future  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely seriously harm the market price of our common stock 
operating results vary depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues for most quarters has been booked in the last month of the quarter and the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations in operating results may not become evident until late in or even at the end of a particular quarter 
in addition  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we focus on larger business accounts 
as a result  a delay in recognizing revenue  even from just one account  could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
in the past  a significant portion of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter could negatively impact our operating results 
we generally expect that revenues in the first quarter of each year will be lower than revenues in the fourth quarter of the preceding year due to the annual nature of companies purchasing and budgeting cycles and the year to date structure of our sales incentive program 
our expense levels are relatively fixed for a particular quarter and are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenues 
as a result  if revenue levels fall below our expectations for a particular quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues 
we have historically operated with little product backlog  because our products are generally delivered as orders are received 
as a result  revenue in any quarter will depend on the volume and timing  and the ability to fill  orders received in that quarter 
we expect significant increases in our operating expenses we intend to substantially increase our operating expenses as we o increase our sales and marketing activities  including expanding our direct sales force  o increase our research and development activities  o expand our customer support and professional services organizations  and o expand our distribution channels 
with these additional expenses  we must significantly increase our revenues in order to achieve profitability 
these expenses will be incurred before we generate any revenues associated with this increased spending 
if we do not significantly increase revenues from these efforts  our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
our success depends on our castanet product family we expect to continue to derive substantial revenues from our castanet product line and related services 
a decline in the price of castanet or our inability to increase sales of castanet would seriously harm our business and operating results 
we cannot predict castanet s success 
we periodically update castanet to make improvements and provide additional enhancements 
new versions of castanet may not provide the benefits we expect and could fail to meet customers requirements or achieve widespread market acceptance 
furthermore  new products such as our timbale product line could fail to meet customer expectations or achieve widespread market acceptance 
our strategy requires castanet to be highly scalable in other words  able to rapidly increase deployment size from a limited number of end users to a very large number of end users 
if we are unable to achieve this level of scalability  the attractiveness of our products and services would be diminished 
we need to grow our timbale product revenues and develop and introduce new products and services during  revenues from our timbale product line accounted for of total license revenues 
there can be no assurance that the revenues from our timbale product line will grow  in absolute amount or as a percentage of total license revenues  or that our timbale products will meet customer expectations or gain widespread market acceptance 
to provide comprehensive management solutions  we will need to develop and introduce new products and services  which offer functionality that we do not currently provide 
we may not be able to develop these technologies and therefore we may not be able to offer a comprehensive internet infrastructure management solution 
in addition  in the past we have experienced delays in new product releases  and we may experience similar delays in the future 
if we fail to deploy new product releases on a timely basis  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we depend on the growth of our customer base and increased business from our current customers our success is substantially dependent on the continued growth of our customer base 
if we fail to increase our customer base  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the reliability  security  scalability and cost effectiveness of our products and services as well as our ability to effectively market our products and services 
if we fail to generate repeat and expanded business from our current customers  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
many of our customers initially make a limited purchase of our products and services for pilot programs 
these customers may not choose to purchase additional licenses to expand their use of our products 
in addition  as we deploy new versions of our products or introduce new products  our current customers may not require the functionality of our new products and may not ultimately license these products 
because the total amount of maintenance and support fees we receive in any period depends in large part on the size and number of licenses that we have previously sold  any downturn in our software license revenues would negatively impact our future service revenues 
in addition  if customers elect not to renew their maintenance agreements  our service revenues could be significantly adversely affected 
implementation of our products by large customers may be complex and customers could become dissatisfied if implementation of our products proves difficult  costly or time consuming our products must integrate with many existing computer systems and software programs used by our customers 
integrating with many other computer systems and software programs can be complex  time consuming and expensive and cause delays in the deployment of our products for such customers 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementations prove to be difficult  costly or time consuming and this could negatively impact our ability to sell our products 
we must retain and attract key personnel our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of the members of our senior management and other key personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  john olsen  our chairman and chief strategy officer  kim polese  and our chief technology officer  arthur van hoff 
we have in the past lost senior management personnel 
several members of our senior management are relatively new to marimba  and our success will depend in part on the successful assimilation and performance of these individuals 
we may not be successful in attracting qualified senior management personnel or be able to attract  assimilate and retain other key personnel in the future 
none of our senior management or other key personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
if we lose additional key employees and are unable to replace them with qualified individuals  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
in addition  our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel 
like other companies based primarily in the san francisco bay area  we face intense competition for qualified personnel 
we have a long sales cycle that depends upon factors outside our control a customer s decision to license our products typically involves a significant commitment of resources and is influenced by the customer s budget cycles 
in addition  selling our products requires us to educate potential customers on their use and benefits 
as a result  our products have a long sales cycle which can take over six months 
we face difficulty predicting the quarter in which sales to expected customers may occur 
the sale of our products is also subject to delays from the lengthy budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes of our customers that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to test our products before they decide whether to purchase a license for deployment 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by us or our competitors 
our markets are highly competitive our markets are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could seriously harm our business and operating results 
we encounter competition from a number of sources  including o sellers of enterprise wide management systems  which include electronic software distribution  o companies that market products that support the distribution of software applications and content  and o desktop software management suites 
in addition  we compete with various methods of application distribution and management  including thin client systems and the web browser  and with application server vendors and others that have introduced software distribution capabilities into their products 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate additional components into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
furthermore  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these companies have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships that they could leverage  including relationships with many of our current and potential customers 
these companies also have significantly more established customer support and professional service organizations than we do 
in addition  these companies may adopt aggressive pricing policies which we are unable to match 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices 
protection of our intellectual property is limited we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these legal protections afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use our proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business and operating results 
in addition  we sell our products internationally  and the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
we may be found to infringe proprietary rights of others other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent  or limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
as a result  we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
furthermore  companies in the software market are increasingly bringing suits alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  particularly patent rights 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any litigation  and intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o cease selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  o obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  and o redesign products or services 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology  our business and operating results would be significantly harmed 
we depend upon third party distribution relationships and need to develop new relationships we have a limited number of distribution relationships and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
for example  netscape  a former reseller of our products  accounted for a significant amount of our revenues in  but is no longer a reseller of our products 
in addition  our original equipment manufacturer arrangement with tivoli has recently accounted for a decreasing percentage of our revenues 
during fiscal and  tivoli accounted for less than of our revenues  as compared to of our revenues in fiscal our current agreements with our channel partners do not prevent these companies from selling products of other companies  including products that may compete with our products  and do not generally require these companies to purchase minimum quantities of our products 
these distributors could give higher priority to the products of other companies or to their own products  than they give to our products 
in addition  sales through these channels generally result in lower fees to marimba than direct sales 
as a result  while the loss of  or significant reduction in sales volume to any of our current or future distribution partners could seriously harm our revenues and operating results  a significant increase in sales through these channels could also negatively impact our gross margins 
we need to develop and expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities we need to expand our marketing and direct sales operations in order to increase market awareness of our products  market our products to a greater number of enterprises and generate increased revenues 
we have historically not been able to hire employees as quickly as planned 
in particular  competition for qualified sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to hire enough qualified sales personnel in the future 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at senior management of our prospective customers 
new hires require extensive training and typically take at least six months to achieve full productivity 
in addition  we have limited experience marketing our products broadly to a large number of potential customers  both in the united states and elsewhere 
we need to expand our professional services we may not be able to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified services personnel that our business needs 
we believe that growth in our product sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with professional services and to educate third party resellers and consultants on how to provide similar services 
as a result  we plan to increase the number of our services personnel to meet these needs 
however  competition for qualified services personnel is intense 
we expect our total service revenues to increase as we continue to provide support  consulting and training services that complement our products and as our installed customer base grows 
this could negatively impact our gross margin because margins on revenues derived from services are generally lower than gross margins on revenues derived from the license of our products 
expanding internationally is expensive  we may receive no benefit from our expansion and our international operations are subject to governmental regulation we plan to increase our international sales force and operations 
however  we may not be successful in increasing our international sales 
in addition  our international business activities are subject to a variety of risks  including the adoption of or changes in laws  currency fluctuations  actions by third parties and political and economic conditions that could restrict or eliminate our ability to do business in foreign jurisdictions 
to date  we have not adopted a hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
export clearances  and in some cases  import clearances must be obtained before our products can be distributed internationally 
current or new government laws and regulations  or the application of existing laws and regulations  could expose us to significant liabilities  significantly slow our growth and seriously harm our business and operating results 
we must manage our growth and expansion our historical growth has placed  and any further growth is likely to continue to place  a significant strain on our resources 
any failure to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business and operating results 
to be successful  we will need to implement additional management information systems  improve our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  train new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  finance  legal  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
in addition  our growth has resulted  and any future growth will result  in increased responsibilities for management personnel 
we rely on third party software and applications we integrate third party security and encryption software and digital certificates as a component of our software 
there are inherent limitations in the use and capabilities of much of the technology that we license from third parties 
as a result  we face a number of challenges in integrating these technologies into our products 
we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
in addition  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain this software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
almost all of our products are written in java and require a java virtual machine made available by sun microsystems  inc in order to operate 
sun may not continue to make these implementations of the java virtual machines available at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
furthermore  if sun were to make significant changes to the java language or its java virtual machine implementations  or fail to correct defects and limitations in these products  our ability to continue to improve and ship our products could be impaired 
in the future  our customers may also require the ability to deploy our products on platforms for which technically acceptable java implementations either do not exist or are not available on commercially reasonable terms 
our customers may also use particular implementations of the java virtual machine that may not be technically or commercially acceptable for integration into our products 
software defects in our products would harm our business complex software products like ours often contain errors or defects  including errors relating to security  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
our products extensively utilize digital certificates and other complex technology 
our use of this technology has in the past and may in the future result in product behavior problems which may not be anticipated by us or our customers 
defects or errors in current or future products could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance  which would seriously harm our business and operating results 
since many of our customers use our products for business critical applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damage to our customers and could significantly impair their operations 
our customers could seek damages for losses related to any of these issues 
for example  we could be subject to claims for losses by customers that we are unable to identify and notify and  as a result  do not install our update that avoids the digital certificate problem 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if not successful  would likely be time consuming and costly to defend and could adversely affect our marketing efforts 
volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and related litigation  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for the common stock of technology companies 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such a company 
such litigation against marimba could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources and seriously harm our business and operating results 
our future capital needs are uncertain we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could seriously harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  if we issue additional equity securities  stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise funds  if needed  on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
we face challenges stemming from our emerging markets the market for our products has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and will likely have an increasing number of competitors 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will emerge or be sustainable 
if our market fails to develop  or develops more slowly than expected  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
furthermore  in order to be successful in this emerging market  we must be able to differentiate marimba from our competitors through our product and service offerings and brand name recognition 
we may not be successful in differentiating marimba or achieving widespread market acceptance of our products and services 
furthermore  enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in other methods of deploying and managing their applications and services may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing systems 
we depend on continued use of the internet and growth of electronic business rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet has occurred only recently 
as a result  acceptance and use may not continue to develop at historical rates  and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt  and continue to use  the internet and other online services as a medium of commerce 
demand and market acceptance for recently introduced services and products over the internet are subject to a high level of uncertainty  and there exist few proven services and products 
in addition  the internet may not be accepted as a long term commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
our success will depend  in large part  upon third parties maintaining the internet infrastructure to provide a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  security and hardware necessary for reliable internet access and services 
we must respond to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards the markets for our internet infrastructure management solutions are marked by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
new solutions based on new technologies or new industry standards can quickly render existing solutions obsolete and unmarketable 
any delays in our ability to develop and release enhanced or new solutions could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our technology is complex  and new products  enhancements and services can require long development and testing periods 
our failure to conform to prevailing standards could have a negative effect on our business and operating results 
we face risks associated with potential acquisitions we may make acquisitions in the future 
acquisitions of companies  products or technologies entail numerous risks  including an inability to successfully assimilate acquired operations and products  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired companies and substantial transaction costs 
some of the products acquired may require significant additional development before they can be marketed and may not generate revenue at anticipated levels 
moreover  future acquisitions by us may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  large one time write offs and the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant amortization expense 
any of these problems or factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments

maturing during in thousands december  cash equivalents  weighted average interest rate investments   weighted average interest rate total   weighted average interest rate maturing during in thousands december  cash equivalents  weighted average interest rate investments   weighted average interest rate total   weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity we develop products in the united states  and sell our products and services primarily in north america  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by various factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as all sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
to date  however  because we operate primarily in the united states and all sales have been made in us dollars  we have had no material exposures to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we have no basis to quantify the risk from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates
