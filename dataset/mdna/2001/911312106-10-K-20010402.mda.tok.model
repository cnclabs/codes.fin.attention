item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations compared to the following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue  average daily package volume and average revenue per piece  both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms year ended december  change revenue in millions us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export cargo total international package non package ups logistics group other total non package consolidated average daily package volume in thousands us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export total international package consolidated average revenue per piece us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export total international package consolidated us domestic package revenue increased almost billion  or  primarily due to volume gains across all product lines  combined with a increase in average revenue per piece  which was primarily driven by our ground products 
all products contributed to the revenue increase  with our higher revenue per piece express next day air and deferred products increasing at approximately the same rate and respectively 
our average daily ground volume grew at a rate for the period  helping to bring our total us average daily package volume to almost million pieces 
during the first quarter of  we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential charge continued to be over the commercial ground rate  with an additional delivery area surcharge of added to certain less accessible areas 
in addition  we increased rates for ups next day air  ups next day air saver and ups nd day air an average of 
the surcharge for ups next day air early am did not change 
rates for international shipments originating in the united states worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased by 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
the increase in international package revenue was due to double digit volume growth for both our domestic and export products  offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these products 
this decline was primarily due to a decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar that occurred during the value of the euro averaged in compared to in overall average daily package volume increased for international operations  with our export products  which had an average revenue per piece in excess of  increasing at 
the increase in non package revenue resulted primarily from the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers as well as continued growth of the ups logistics group 
revenue for the ups logistics group increased by million  or  to over billion for the year ended december  the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance began in the fourth quarter of consequently  this item will have a reduced impact on the comparability of the revenue for our non package segment in future periods 
operating expenses increased by billion  or  which was less than our revenue increase of 
compensation and benefits expenses  the largest component of this increase  accounted for billion of the increase and included a million charge recorded in the first quarter of relating to the creation of  new full time hourly jobs resulting from the teamsters contract 
other operating expenses increased million primarily due to higher purchased transportation costs  higher fuel costs and claims expense associated with the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers 
the increase in purchased transportation costs was primarily due to increased business for our international and logistics operations 
the increase in fuel costs from million to million was due to the increase in fuel prices during and the additional fuel usage due to the growth in our average daily package volume  partially offset by cost reductions generated by our fuel hedging program 
the increase in other operating expenses of million was slightly offset by the million gain we recognized in the first quarter of from the sale of our ups truck leasing subsidiary 
international operating expenses were favorably impacted by the decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar as discussed above 
to offset the increasing fuel costs we have experienced over the last several quarters and that we expect to continue into the near future  we implemented a temporary fuel surcharge effective august  approximately million in revenue was recorded in as a result of the surcharge 
our operating margin  defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue  improved from during to during this improvement continues our recently reported trends and was favorably impacted by continued product mix improvements and our continued successful efforts in obtaining profitable volume growth 
the following table shows the change in operating profit  both in dollars and in percentage terms year ended december  change operating segment in millions us domestic package international package non package consolidated operating profit us domestic package operating profit increased by million  or  due to the volume and revenue improvements discussed previously 
the improvement in the operating profit of our international package segment of  or million  resulted primarily from increased volume and revenue  and was realized despite significantly higher fuel costs 
this improvement occurred throughout our international regions 
the improvement in operating profit for this segment would have been million greater  if the impact of currency fluctuations was excluded 
the increase in non package operating profit is largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers  which contributed million of additional operating profit for the year 
also contributing to the operating profit improvement was the million gain we recognized during the first quarter of from the sale of our ups truck leasing subsidiary 
these improvements were offset somewhat by start up costs associated with ups logistics group s service parts logistics offering  ups e ventures  ups capital corporation and other initiatives 
the increase in investment income of million for the period is primarily due to two factors 
first  in the first quarter of  two companies in which our strategic enterprise fund held investments were acquired by other companies  which caused us to recognize a gain of million 
second  we earned income on the billion in net ipo proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that was completed in early march and the billion in ipo proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer 
in  we had the net ipo proceeds available for investment from mid november through the end of the year 
we announced a share repurchase program on april  under which we would utilize up to the remaining billion not used in the tender offer 
as of december   approximately million remained available for share repurchases 
net income for the year ended december  was billion  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the prior year 
our results reflect the non recurring items discussed above  which include the gains on our strategic enterprise fund investments and the sale of our ups truck leasing subsidiary  offset partially by the charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full time jobs from existing part time teamster jobs 
our results reflect a tax assessment charge resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the us tax court 
excluding these non recurring transactions for each of these years  adjusted net income for would have been billion  an increase in excess of over adjusted net income of billion 
adjusted diluted earnings per share would have increased from in to in our fourth quarter results reflected a decline in our previously reported growth rates for both revenue and average daily volume 
these declines were caused by an overall weakening of the economy 
compared to the following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue  average daily package volume and average revenue per piece  both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms year ended december  change revenue in millions us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export cargo total international package non package ups logistics group other total non package consolidated average daily package volume in thousands us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export total international package consolidated average revenue per piece us domestic package next day air deferred ground total us domestic package international package domestic export total international package consolidated us domestic package revenue increased more than billion primarily due to a increase in average daily package volume combined with a improvement in revenue per piece 
package volume growth was experienced in all products  with average volumes for our next day air and deferred products growing at and  respectively 
we generated substantial growth in our ground revenue  which comprised of our us domestic package revenue  based on average volume growth of and a improvement in average revenue per piece 
during the first quarter of  we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential charge continued to be over the commercial ground rate  with an additional delivery area surcharge added to certain less accessible areas 
in addition  we increased rates for ups next day air  ups next day air saver and ups nd day air an average of  while we decreased the rate for ups nd day air am by 
the rate for ups next day air early am did not change 
rates for international shipments originating in the united states did not increase for ups worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market 
the increase in international package revenue was primarily due to an overall improvement in product mix  specifically volume growth for our export products 
all international operations posted double digit volume growth in export services  with the largest increases experienced in our asia pacific and european operations 
due to the strong growth of our international export products  our total average revenue per piece for the international segment increased  or 
the growth in non package revenue resulted primarily from the continued growth of the ups logistics group 
this growth reflects both new business and increased business with existing customers 
revenue for the non package segment was also increased by the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers  which commenced in the fourth quarter of operating expenses increased by billion  or  which was less than our increase in revenue of 
compensation and benefit expenses accounted for million of this increase 
purchased transportation costs increased by million and fuel costs increased by million 
the operating margin for was compared to in this improvement was largely due to containment of operating expense growth through better utilization of existing capacity and from continued company wide cost containment efforts 
the following table shows the change in operating profit  both in dollars and in percentage terms year ended december  change operating segment in millions us domestic package international package non package consolidated operating profit us domestic package operating profit improved due to the volume and revenue improvements discussed previously  combined with the containment of operating expense growth 
our international package operating profit improved significantly in due to a shift to higher yielding export packages 
average daily volume for our export products grew over the europe and asia pacific regions contributed significantly to overall operating profit improvements 
the increase in non package operating profit was largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers 
the new arrangement for excess value package insurance  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of  increased non package operating profit by million 
this increase was offset by continued start up costs at ups capital corporation  higher third party underwriting losses for upinsco  our captive insurance company  and a reduction in intersegment profit 
the ups logistics group experienced a small decrease in operating profit compared to last year 
this decrease was due to third party transportation costs for the group s service parts logistics offering and higher fuel costs for its ups truck leasing subsidiary 
these decreases were offset somewhat by higher operating profits for the group s supply chain management offering 
the increase in investment income of million for the year was due to large cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and short term investments balances we have maintained during  including the ipo proceeds received in november 
net income for decreased by million from  resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from in to in these results reflect the charge we recorded during the second quarter of  resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the us tax court 
excluding the impact of this one time charge of billion  our adjusted net income for would have been billion  with an associated adjusted diluted earnings per share of 
further discussion of this matter is included in the liquidity and capital resources section 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations 
we maintain significant cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term investments  amounting to billion at december  of this amount  approximately million represents the net proceeds remaining from our initial public offering  which was completed in november in november  we received net proceeds of billion from our initial public offering 
we used the majority of the ipo proceeds to fund a cash tender offer to purchase class a shares from shareowners 
the remaining ipo proceeds of approximately million as of december  were available for a share repurchase program that was announced on april  in addition  an additional million has been authorized for share repurchases 
we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion 
approximately billion was outstanding under these programs as of december  since we do not intend to refinance the full commercial paper balance outstanding at december   million has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet 
the average interest rate on the amount outstanding at december  was 
we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
these agreements provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring on april  and the other expiring on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december  we also maintain a billion european medium term note program 
under this program  we may issue notes from time to time  denominated in a variety of currencies 
at december   billion was available under this program 
the million outstanding at december   which was issued under this program in  bears interest at a stated rate of 
subsequent to december   we issued million of year pound sterling bonds under this program  which bear interest at a stated rate of 
we have filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the us of up to billion 
the debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies 
in september  we issued million cash settled convertible senior notes due september  pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the notes were sold at par with a stated interest rate of and are callable after three years 
the notes may be exchanged for an amount of cash that is indexed to the trading price of class b common stock 
there was approximately million issued under this shelf registration statement at december  subsequent to december   we have issued debt under our ups notes program 
the notes issued under this program have various terms and maturities  all with fixed interest rates 
as of february   million has been issued under this program 
also subsequent to december   we issued million in floating rate senior notes due december  which bear interest at one month libor less basis points 
on august  the us tax court issued an opinion unfavorable to ups regarding a notice of deficiency asserting that we are liable for additional tax for the and tax years 
the court held that we are liable for tax on income of opl  which had reinsured excess value package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in in february  the us tax court entered a decision in accord with its opinion 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the irs issued two notices of deficiency asserting that we are liable for additional tax for the through tax years  and the through tax years 
the primary assertions by the irs relate to the reinsurance of excess value package insurance  the issue raised for the tax year 
the irs has based its assertions on the same theories included in the notice of deficiency 
the irs  in an issued report  has taken similar positions for tax years through we expect the irs to take similar positions for tax years through we believe that a number of aspects of the tax court decision are incorrect  and we have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
the eleventh circuit has heard oral arguments 
we do not know when the court will render a decision 
we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits that seek to hold us and in certain cases  other defendants liable for the collection of premiums for excess value package insurance in connection with package shipments since or  in some of the cases  for shorter time periods 
the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot presently be determined 
in addition  we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
in our opinion  none of these cases is expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in november  osha published its final ergonomics standard  which would have required american industry to take expansive compliance steps in the workplace when employees report musculoskeletal complaints such as low back pain 
the rule was subsequently challenged by a broad coalition of trade associations and businesses in actions consolidated in the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit 
we  our competitors  and other affected parties filed comments with osha challenging several aspects of the rule  including the medical support and economic and technical feasibility of the proposed regulations 
osha took the position that the cost of compliance with the proposed regulations would have been only billion per year over a ten year period for all of american industry 
we maintained that these estimates were unrealistic and estimated that the cost of compliance would have been significantly greater  both in initial costs and in incremental annual costs 
we estimated that such expenditures  if required to be incurred  would have materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
subsequent to december   the united states senate and house of representatives passed joint resolutions disapproving the osha ergonomics standard  and declaring that the standard shall have no force or effect 
president bush has signed into law a repeal of the osha ergonomics standard 
we anticipate that the legal proceedings described above will be dismissed as moot 
reference is made to note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information on each of the matters tax court decision  lawsuits and osha discussed previously 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases through following is a summary of capital expenditures year ended december  in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately billion in these expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and certain commodity prices 
all of this market risk arises in the normal course of business  as ups does not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to increases in the price of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are all used in our normal business operations 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel consumption for periods up to one year 
the net fair value of such contracts  subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset liability of approximately and million  respectively 
the potential change in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating costs  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound sterling 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was a liability of approximately million and none  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million and none for and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that are issued at fixed rates of interest 
such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair value of our total long term debt at december  and was and billion  respectively 
the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical shift in interest rates would be approximately and million for and  respectively 
we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt 
the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december  and was an asset of approximately and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical shift in interest rates would be approximately and million for and  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates 
equity price risk we hold investments in various available for sale equity securities that are subject to price risk 
the fair value of such investments  as of december  and  was an asset of approximately and million  respectively 
in addition  we utilize options to hedge the price risk for certain of these equity securities 
the potential change in the fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately and million for and  respectively 
credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
future accounting changes in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  as amended by statements no 
and no 
 which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
after adoption on january   all derivative instruments will be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value  and changes in the fair values of such instruments will be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
we will record a one time cumulative effect  after tax charge totaling million in the income statement  as well as an unrealized accumulated transition adjustment gain of million to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the initial adoption of fas in the quarter ended march  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements about matters that are inherently difficult to predict 
these statements include statements regarding our intent  belief and current expectations about our strategic direction  prospects and future results 
we have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
risk factors the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward looking statements the impact of competition on a local  regional  national and international basis 
our competitors include the postal services of the us and other nations  various motor carriers  express companies  freight forwarders  air couriers and others 
our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation  and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates 
the affect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate  both in the united states and internationally 
our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks 
strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees 
such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs  and we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service 
the terms of future collective bargaining agreements may also affect our competitive position and results of operations 
the impact of complex and stringent aviation  transportation  environmental  labor  employment and other governmental laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations 
an increase in the prices of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles 
we require significant quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products 
cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services
