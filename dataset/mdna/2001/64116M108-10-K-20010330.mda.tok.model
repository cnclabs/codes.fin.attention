item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect our performance and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we were incorporated in july to provide internet audience measurement information and analysis 
from our founding through the launch of our initial netratings service offering in march  we were primarily engaged in research activities  developing our initial products and services  raising capital  and building our business infrastructure 
our initial service offering utilized a web based panel selection methodology  a relatively small audience panel  and an early version of our data collection software 
in october  we established our strategic relationship with nielsen media research 
through this relationship  we began developing an expanded internet audience measurement panel based on the nielsen media research audience sampling methodology and enhanced versions of our software 
in march  we launched our nielsen netratings brand of product and service offerings in the united states and in june we began providing data based on our canadian panel 
in june  we commenced our international expansion efforts by establishing a joint venture  netratings japan 
netratings japan is responsible for building and maintaining a japanese audience measurement panel and introducing our products and services to the japanese market 
in march  netratings japan began providing data based on the japanese audience measurement panel 
as of december   we held a direct ownership interest in netratings japan  acnielsen eratings 
com  our joint venture partner  held a ownership  and the remaining ownership interest was held by various japanese investors 
in september  we entered into a joint venture with acnielsen to develop and maintain internet audience measurement panels and to market products and services under the nielsen netratings brand in other key international markets 
through the joint venture  acnielsen eratings 
com  in which we held a ownership interest as of december  and acnielsen held the remaining  we have developed and released data for internet audience measurement panels in australia  brazil  denmark  finland  germany  hong kong  ireland  italy  korea  netherlands  new zealand  norway  singapore  spain  sweden  taiwan  and the united kingdom 
panels are now under development in austria  belgium  israel  mexico  south africa  and switzerland  and it is anticipated that these services will be rolled out before the end of as part of this joint venture  acnielsen is responsible for the costs related to the initial development of these panels 
in january  we established a joint venture in france  mediametrie eratings 
com  in which we held a ownership interest as of december   acnielsen eratings 
com held a ownership interest  and mediametrie held the remaining ownership interest 
mediametrie eratings 
com is responsible for building and maintaining a french audience measurement panel and introducing our products and services to the french market 
in september  mediametrie eratings 
com began providing data based on the french audience measurement panel 
through our strategic relationships and our joint ventures  we now provide the nielsen netratings service in countries and panel development has commenced in an additional countries 
we generate revenue from the sale of our internet audience measurement products and services 
through december   our information and analytical products and services  which include our audience measurement services  ecommerce services  and media and advertising services have accounted for substantially all of our revenue 
we primarily sell these products and services pursuant to one year subscription agreements and bill our customers in advance  typically on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our information and analytical products and services ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
prepaid subscription fees are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of custom research services and royalty payments from our joint venture partners 
revenue from these custom services is recognized in the period in which the service is provided 
we sell our products and services to customers in a wide range of industries 
our customer base for the nielsen netratings service has increased from over customers worldwide as of december  to more than customers worldwide as of december  cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to the recruitment and maintenance of our us and canadian audience measurement panels  which are expensed as they are incurred 
accordingly  such expenses are not directly related to revenue or subscriptions generated in a given period and are higher in periods in which we are involved in significant panel development activities 
also included in cost of revenue are the data acquisition costs related to our joint ventures  which are recognized ratably over the term of the customer s subscription agreement  as the data is provided 
we believe that the continued development and enhancement of audience measurement panels is essential to the long term expansion of our business 
we expect that costs of revenue will increase in future periods as we continue to develop and enhance our audience measurement panels and add additional panel infrastructure to support the growth of our services 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel associated with our research services and product development activities 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
we also anticipate that additional development resources will be required to support the international activities of our joint ventures as well as planned expansion of our services 
accordingly  we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and commissions to our salespeople and analysts  commissions paid to nielsen media research  as well as costs related to seminars  promotional materials  public relations  advertising  and other sales and marketing programs 
we intend to expand our sales force in conjunction with our domestic expansion and to support our international joint ventures 
we also intend to increase our marketing activities to enhance the awareness of the nielsen netratings brand and our products and services 
we therefore expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal  information technology and other administrative personnel  in addition to professional fees  provisions for doubtful accounts  and other general corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we add personnel and information systems to support expanding operations and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the reporting requirements of a public company 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees  we recorded non cash stock based compensation costs of million as of the year ended december  representing the difference between the exercise price of these options and the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant 
these amounts are being amortized over the respective vesting periods of the options using a graded vesting method 
simultaneously with the series c preferred stock financing in august  we entered into additional agreements with nielsen media research governing our strategic relationship with it 
we also issued two warrants to nielsen media research  with respect to which we recorded non cash stock based compensation costs of million for the year ended december  representing the black scholes value of these warrants 
these costs are being amortized over five years 
we recognized non cash compensation charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  representing amortization of these stock based compensation costs 
we have not recorded any additional non cash stock based compensation costs for the year ended december  as of december   the remaining non cash stock based compensation was scheduled to be amortized at the rate of approximately million  million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
the actual amount of these charges to be recognized in future periods could decrease if options for which accrued compensation has been recorded are terminated before they vest 
loss from joint ventures represents an accrual for future capital contributions to our acnielsen eratings 
com joint venture  as well as the write down of certain joint venture investments for our pro rata share of their losses incurred in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we expect the losses related to joint ventures will continue in future periods as we reach operational status on countries served by our acnielsen eratings 
com joint venture and continue our investment in our japan and french joint ventures 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
interest expense relates to the interest charges incurred in connection with our credit facilities as well as the interest charges associated with our accrual for future capital contributions to our acnielsen eratings 
com joint venture 
due primarily to anticipated declines in interest rates in  we expect interest income to decrease in future periods 
we have recorded no provision for federal or state income taxes for any period since our inception as we have incurred losses in each period 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  expiring in utilization of the net operating loss tax and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
see note of notes to financial statements 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
we incurred net losses of million  million  million  and million for the years ended    and the period from july  inception through december   respectively 
we intend to invest heavily to add a disaster recovery data center  strengthen our direct sales force  enhance our product and service offerings  and develop the infrastructure requirements necessary to grow the company 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
see factors that may affect our performance we have incurred losses since inception and we may be unable to achieve profitability

revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales of our information and analytical products and services accounted for substantially all of the revenue for each year 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to the increase in the number of customers coupled with the introduction of new products and services  including the international audience measurement services as well as new analytical services 
the increase in also represents the amortization of deferred revenue associated with our customer subscriptions in accordance with our revenue policy 
for the year ended december   our audience measurement service comprised of our revenue  compared to for the year ended december   our suite of analytical services comprised of the revenue  compared to for the year ended december   and international royalties accounted for the remaining with no corresponding royalties for the year ended december  during the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase reflects costs incurred in relating to the production support of our nielsen netratings online services  initiation of our canadian and us at work panels  and the amortization of the data acquisition costs due to our joint ventures recognized ratably over the terms of the subscription agreements  as the data is provided 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily from the two fold increase in the number of employees and other payroll related expenses partially offset by reimbursement by our international joint ventures for engineering services performed on their behalf 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the two fold increase in the number of sales and marketing employees  a four fold increase in commission related expenses resulting from a increase in revenue  and increased costs related to the promotion of our products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase in absolute dollars was primarily related to a three fold increase in the number of administrative personnel to support our expanded operations  expansion of our facilities  recurring and non recurring professional fees  and an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from a full year of amortization expense related to the deferred compensation costs resulting from the issuance of warrants to nielsen media research in loss from joint ventures 
loss from joint ventures for the year ended december  was million or of revenue 
we did not record any losses related to our joint ventures in the corresponding period in as they were not operational 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from  or of revenues  for the year ended december  interest income increased due to the addition of million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting primarily from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement transactions with nielsen media research 
see further discussion of these transactions in notes to the financial statements  note redeemable convertible preferred stock 
net loss 
for the year ended december   our net loss decreased to million  or a loss of per share on approximately million shares outstanding  as compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per share on approximately million shares outstanding  for year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to an increase in revenue recorded and a reduction in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue  offset by the continued expansion of the company  the accrued losses on joint venture activity  and the amortization of stock based compensation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased  to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  sales of our information and analytical products and services accounted for substantially all of the revenue for each year 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to the introduction of our nielsen netratings service in march and additional product and service offerings that resulted in a substantial increase in the number of our customers 
for the year ended december   our audience measurement service comprised of our revenue and our suite of analytical services accounted for the remaining 
during the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflected costs incurred in relating to the development of both the nielsen netratings home audience measurement panel from  members at january  to  at december  and initial development costs related to our work panel 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a three fold increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to sales commissions related to a significant increase in revenue  a six fold increase in the number of direct sales and marketing employees and increased costs related to the promotion of our products and services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of administrative personnel to support our expanded operations  expansion of our facilities  and non recurring legal fees 
the decrease in general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to revenues increasing at a greater rate than expenses 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net  increased to  of net interest income for the year ended december  from  of net interest expense for the year ended december  interest expense increased due to interest paid to nielsen media research and other investors under short term promissory notes and increased borrowings under our credit facilities 
interest expense was more than offset by increases in interest income related to the addition of million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments resulting primarily from our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement transactions with nielsen media research 
see further discussion of these transactions in notes to the financial statements  note redeemable convertible preferred stock 
net loss 
net loss increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or  of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with the development of the nielsen netratings audience measurement panels  a four fold increase in headcount to support our expanded operations  and an increase in stock based compensation expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december  from million at december  operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  primarily related to interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances 
the cash provided by operating activities was offset by additional operating expenses related to the expansion of our operations 
operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  related to operating expenses due to the growth of our operations domestically 
operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december  primarily due to the expansion of our domestic operations primarily related to research and development of our audience measurement technology 
our operating expenses will continue to increase due to costs related to our domestic and international expansion 
investing activities used cash of million in related to the purchase of short term investments  investments in joint ventures  and capital expenditures of million 
investing activities used cash of million in due to capital expenditures of  and net purchases of short term investments of million 
our investing activities used cash of  in primarily for the purchase of capital equipment 
although we had no material capital expenditure commitments at december  we anticipate that capital expenditures will increase significantly in due to the anticipated growth in operations and infrastructure related to our expansion and the implementation of a disaster recovery data center and our obligation to repay  during the fourth quarter of  our share of any advanced capital contributions related to the acnielsen eratings 
com joint venture 
financing activities provided cash of  in  related to the exercise of options and sales of our stock through the employee stock purchase plan  offset by payments on the capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million in arising primarily from proceeds resulting the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering and our private placement transactions with nielsen media research 
these activities were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
financing activities provided cash of million for primarily due to the issuance of convertible preferred stock and promissory notes 
we have a total million equipment line of credit with venture lending leasing 
funds borrowed under the line of credit are secured by all of our tangible assets and bear interest at an annual rate of 
as of december  we had utilized approximately  under the line of credit with a balance of  outstanding 
in addition  we have a million commercial line of credit with heritage bank of commerce 
borrowings under this line are secured by our business assets other than those securing our equipment loans and bear interest at the bank s prime interest rate  which was as of december  our credit agreement with heritage bank contains certain financial covenants  including minimum liquidity at or above million  tangible net worth of million  and debt to tangible net worth ratio of to as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
as of december   we had no outstanding balances on the credit facilities with heritage bank of commerce 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we could require additional capital prior to the end of this period if  for example  we were to pursue one or more business acquisitions or investments 
at present we do not have any commitments or agreements for business acquisitions or investments 
if we do require additional financing  however  we cannot be certain that it will be available when required  on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are not successful in raising additional capital as required  our business could be harmed 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 
factors that may affect our performance we have incurred losses since inception and we may be unable to achieve profitability we have experienced operating losses in each quarter and annual period since inception 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the year ended december   and respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we intend to make additional expenditures related to panel development and maintenance  marketing  hiring of additional personnel  strategic alliances  development of a disaster recovery data center and further improvement of our technology and infrastructure 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
although our revenue has grown in recent periods  we may not be able to achieve significant revenue growth in the future 
our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we may not achieve sufficient revenue to become profitable 
we have a limited operating history in the evolving market for internet audience measurement we were incorporated in july and did not start generating revenue until the quarter ended march  we introduced our nielsen netratings internet audience measurement service in the quarter ended march  accordingly  we are still in the initial stages of development and have only a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our business 
one should evaluate our likelihood of financial and operational success in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses  delays and difficulties associated with an early stage business in an evolving market  many of which may be beyond our control  including the risk that a competing company s internet audience measurement service will become the accepted standard for internet audience measurement  our potential inability to successfully manage any significant growth we achieve in the future  our potential inability to develop our brand  and the risks associated with our international expansion 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results might lead to reduced prices for our stock due to our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the market in which we compete  our future revenue is difficult to forecast 
factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenues or operating results on a quarterly basis include the following  many of which are beyond our control the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business  the amount and timing of costs related to changes in the size or composition of our panel  particularly as a result of turnover among panel members  changes in demand for our products and services due to the announcement or introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors  changes in the pricing of our products and services in light of the services and pricing offered by our competitors  the impact of possible acquisitions both on our operations and on our reported operating results due to associated accounting charges  and technical difficulties or service interruptions that significantly harm our ability to deliver our products and services on schedule 
because our expense levels are based in large part on our estimates of future revenues  an unexpected shortfall in revenue would significantly harm our operating results our expense levels are based largely on our investment plans and estimates of future revenue 
we may be unable to adjust our spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures in a particular quarter would harm our results of operations and could cause our stock price to fall sharply  particularly following quarters in which our operating results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
the acceptance and effectiveness of internet advertising and electronic commerce is uncertain  and if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer our future success will depend in part on an increase in the use of the internet as an advertising medium and the proliferation of e commerce 
these markets are new and rapidly evolving  and the effectiveness of internet advertising is uncertain 
as a result  there is also uncertainty about the demand and market acceptance for internet advertising and e commerce 
many of our current or potential customers have little or no experience using the internet for advertising or commerce purposes 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by entities that have historically relied on traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business 
these companies may find internet advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising for promoting their products and services 
they may also be unwilling to pay premium rates for advertising that is targeted at specific types of users based on demographic profiles or recent internet behavior 
the internet advertising and e commerce markets may also be adversely affected by privacy issues surrounding the targeting of this type of advertising or the use of personal information 
providers of goods and services online continue to work toward the establishment of commerce models that are cost effective  unique  and effectively deal with issues such as channel conflict and infrastructure costs 
rapid growth in the use of the internet for e commerce may not continue or the internet may not be adopted as a medium of commerce by a broad base of customers 
in addition  most current and potential publishers of content and commerce merchants on the internet have little or no experience in generating revenue from the sale of advertising space on their internet sites or from conducting on line commerce transactions 
because of the foregoing factors  among others  the market for internet advertising and e commerce may not continue to emerge or become sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop or develop more slowly than we expect  our business will suffer 
the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is highly competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues will decline the market for internet audience measurement and analysis is new  rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly competitive 
in the market for internet audience measurement services  our principal competitor is jupiter media metrix 
additional competitors in the internet audience measurement industry include pc data inc  netvalue  comscore networks  red sherriff  and iamasia 
we are not aware of any other significant competitors in this market  although we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we believe that the market for internet audience measurement services will eventually gravitate toward a uniform standard  based on data collected by a single service provider  that will allow companies to make meaningful decisions regarding online advertising 
we therefore believe that one leading provider is likely to emerge in the market for internet audience measurement services 
jupiter media metrix has provided internet audience measurement services since and  as the first mover in this market  has a head start in becoming the industry standard for such services 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are the development of independent  reliable measurement panels that are representative of the entire target audience  the timeliness of reported results  the breadth and depth of measurement services offered and their flexibility and ease of use  the ability to provide quality analytical services derived from internet audience measurement information  the ability to offer products and services in a comprehensive set of international markets  and pricing 
most of our competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition  and significantly greater marketing resources than we have 
in addition  some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  or devote more resources to technology and systems development 
in light of these factors  we may be unable to compete successfully in our market 
we are dependent on nielsen media research for the development and maintenance of panels of internet users in the united states and canada and on acnielsen and our other joint venture partners for the development and maintenance of such panels in international markets our audience measurement data is collected from randomly selected groups of internet users that are generally referred to as audience measurement panels 
our at home internet audience measurement panels in the united states and canada have been developed and are maintained by nielsen media research as part of our strategic relationship with that company 
similarly  our internet audience measurement panels and other sampling methodologies that we employ in geographic locations outside of the united states  canada  france and japan have been developed and maintained by acnielsen eratings 
com  our joint venture with acnielsen 
any failure on the part of nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint venture partners to devote adequate resources to the development or maintenance of such panels or other sampling methodologies  or to maintain the overall quality of these methodologies  will harm our business 
in addition  nielsen media research may terminate its obligations with respect to internet audience measurement panels in the event it no longer holds at least of our outstanding stock on a fully diluted basis 
vnu nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  controls a majority of our outstanding stock and its representatives constitute a majority of our board of directors vnu  nv  through its wholly owned subsidiaries nielsen media research and acnielsen  has a majority stock ownership position in netratings  which enables it to control the direction and policies of netratings  including the election of our board of directors  amendment of our certificate of incorporation  and decisions regarding mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
this control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving a change of control  including transactions in which the other holders of our common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
during any time that vnu is a majority stockholder  it will be required to consolidate our operating results with its own for financial reporting purposes 
our business strategy will require us to incur significant losses as we attempt to establish our brand by increasing our marketing efforts and establishing strategic relationships 
incurring large expenses for these purposes may conflict with the interests of vnu in maximizing its net earnings  and vnu may therefore attempt to influence our expenditures in order to limit our losses in the short term to the detriment of our long term strategies 
in addition  vnu can control or influence the terms of our important commercial transactions  including our strategic relationships with nielsen media research and acnielsen 
we expect vnu s representatives on our board to recuse themselves from deliberations in which they have a clear conflict of interest 
these directors may take actions that favor vnu s interests over our own  as a result  for instance  of conflicts of interest that are not apparent at the time of such actions 
it is also possible that future actions taken by nielsen media research or acnielsen may adversely affect our other stockholders 
for example nielsen media research could take actions which would increase the number of our customers for whom it is entitled to receive sales commissions  increase the amount paid to it for maintenance of audience measurement panels  decrease the sales goals that it must achieve in order to prevent us from selling advertising expenditure measurement data from third parties  or take other action detrimental to our other stockholders 
acnielsen may dramatically increase operating costs related to the acnielsen eratings joint venture at its discretion forcing us to incur a larger than anticipated cost related to this joint venture 
we cannot forecast the rate at which subscriptions for our services may be renewed and we may not achieve sufficiently high renewal rates to become profitable we derive substantially all of our revenue from annual subscriptions for our services 
as our business becomes more established  we expect subscription renewals to account for an increasing proportion of our revenue 
any unexpectedly low renewal rates would harm our operating results and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
to date  high renewal rates have been an essential element of our revenue growth 
however  we can not assure you that we will continue to experience high renewal rates  particularly during times of economic downturns 
additionally  because most internet related businesses are still in the early stages of development  consolidations in our customer base or the failure of a significant number of our customers businesses could cause a decline in renewal rates for our products and services 
to date  internet and e commerce companies have been a source of revenue growth for us 
consolidation of these companies or the failure of these companies to raise additional capital would adversely affect our new and renewal business 
we may not be successful in developing our brand  which could prevent us from remaining competitive we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and strengthen the nielsen netratings brand  which will depend  in turn  largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide our customers with high quality products 
to promote the nielsen netratings brand  we intend to increase our marketing expenses  and we may incur other types of expenses in order to create and maintain brand loyalty among our clients 
however  we cannot assure you that our efforts will succeed in maintaining and strengthening our brand 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand  or incur excessive expenses attempting to promote and maintain our brand  our business will be harmed 
our brand is dependent on the reputations of third parties over which we have no control the strength of the nielsen netratings brand is also closely dependent on the reputations of nielsen media research  acnielsen  and our other joint venture partners and the strength of their brands 
therefore  any negative publicity generated by nielsen media research  acnielsen  or our other joint venture partners  whether or not directly related to any nielsen netratings branded products or services  as well as any erosion of the strength of any of their brands  will adversely affect our own brand identity 
costs to develop and maintain accurate audience measurement panels are significant and may increase to date  the expense of recruiting and maintaining our audience measurement panels has been substantially all of the cost of revenue reported on our financial statements and  therefore  any increase in this expense will likely result in a corresponding decrease in our gross margin 
we believe that the expansion of the number of our panels as well as the size and scope of our panels is critical to the success of our business 
this expansion is likely to increase our expenses for recruiting and maintaining our panels 
these costs are dependent on many factors beyond our control  including the cooperation rate of potential panel members and turnover among existing panel members  and accordingly we cannot control these costs to match increases or decreases in revenue 
to the extent that such additional expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our results of operations will be harmed 
we have limited experience in developing internet panels  and we could experience lower cooperation rates or higher turnover rates in the future 
we may not be able to recruit or retain qualified personnel our future success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in internet related industries  particularly management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  is intense 
although we provide compensation packages that include stock options  cash incentives  and other employee benefits  we may be unable to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate and retain other highly qualified employees in the future  which would harm our business 
we have no employment agreements with our key personnel  and should we enter into such agreements in the future  they may be ineffective in preventing a key employee from leaving our company 
our planned international expansion could fail our current strategy includes expansion of our services to measure internet audiences outside of those countries we currently serve 
through our own efforts and those of our joint ventures  we have developed and released data from audience measurement panels in australia  brazil  canada  denmark  finland  france  germany  hong kong  ireland  italy  japan  korea  netherlands  new zealand  norway  singapore  spain  sweden  taiwan  and the united kingdom 
panels are now under development in austria  belgium  israel  mexico  south africa  and switzerland  and it is anticipated that these services will be rolled out before the end of our continued expansion into international markets will require management attention and resources 
in addition  there can be no assurance of the continued growth of internet usage in international markets 
the international markets for audience measurement services have historically been localized and difficult to penetrate 
the success of our international expansion will depend on our ability to recruit and maintain at home and at work panels that are representative of a geographic area  control costs and effectively manage foreign operations  and effectively develop  market  and sell new products and services in new  unfamiliar markets 
in addition  if we are successful in establishing our international operations  we will be subject to a number of inherent risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  deficiencies in the telecommunications infrastructure in some countries  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  more rigorous levels of privacy protection in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  economic and political instability  and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the success of our international expansion will be largely dependent on the efforts of acnielsen and our working relationship with acnielsen the challenges we face in expanding internationally require skills and expertise in foreign countries that we do not currently have 
to enable us to expand globally in a rapid timeframe  we have entered into a joint venture with acnielsen  which controls of the joint venture 
acnielsen has agreed to fund all of the venture s panel development costs in the countries initially targeted by the joint venture  which are determined by an operating committee consisting of two representatives of netratings and two representatives of the joint venture corporation 
after this initial stage  however  we may be required to either contribute additional capital to the joint venture or to allow acnielsen to make such capital contributions unilaterally with resulting dilution of our ownership interest in the venture 
accordingly  we could be subject to unanticipated costs or dilution of our ownership interest as a result of actions by the operating committee to limit the countries that are part of the initial roll out of the joint venture s operations 
furthermore  if we encounter significant problems in our working relationship with acnielsen  or if our joint venture is ineffectively managed  our international expansion is likely to fail 
we might not be successful in the development or introduction of new products and services to keep up with the proliferation of alternative internet access devices and technologies related to the expected convergence of the internet and television we believe that an increasing proportion of internet use will involve alternative internet access devices such as web enabled phones and that there will eventually be a convergence of internet content and television programming 
accordingly  in order to continue to provide information about audience behavior throughout all major segments of the internet  we will be required to develop new products and services that address these evolving technologies 
we may be unsuccessful in identifying new product and service opportunities or in developing or marketing new products and services in a timely or cost effective manner 
in addition  product innovations may not achieve the market penetration or price stability necessary for profitability 
finally  we may not be successful in adapting our data collection software to evolving types of internet access devices or content 
if we are unable to provide audience measurement information regarding any significant segments of internet use  demand for our product and service offerings may suffer 
because the internet audience measurement industry is in its infancy  the pricing and acceptance of our products and services is uncertain we may be forced for competitive or technical reasons to reduce prices for some of our products or services or to offer them free of charge 
such circumstances would reduce our revenue and could significantly harm our business 
additionally  our market is still evolving  and we have little basis to assess demand for different types of products or services or to evaluate whether our products and services will be accepted by the market 
if our products and services do not gain broad market acceptance  our business may fail 
a sale by vnu of its stake in netratings could adversely affect our stock price there are no contractual restrictions on the ability of vnu  through its nielsen media research or acnielsen subsidiaries  to sell shares of our common stock  although sales in the public market will be subject to the volume limitations of sec rule pursuant to these volume limitations  a controlling stockholder may sell shares under rule only if the shares to be sold  together with the shares sold during the past three months  do not exceed the greater of of the issuer s outstanding shares or the average weekly trading volume of the issuer s shares during the preceding four calendar weeks 
nielsen media research  acnielsen and several of our other stockholders have the right  under certain circumstances  to require us to register their stock for sale on the public market 
should vnu decide to sell its stake in netratings  it could adversely affect our stock price 
additionally  vnu will have the ability to transfer control of netratings  possibly at a premium over the then current market price 
because vnu will have the ability to effect such a transfer of control unilaterally  other stockholders could be denied an opportunity to participate in the transaction and receive a premium for their shares 
the audience measurement services offered by nielsen media research or acnielsen may eventually have features that overlap with features of our internet audience measurement services as a result of convergence of television and the internet nielsen media research s principal business consists of providing television audience measurement services based on audience panels that it develops independent of its strategic relationship with us 
acnielsen also derives a substantial portion of its revenue from television audience measurement services outside of the united states 
if television and the internet converge in the future as expected  any internet audience information that is reported by television audience measurement services through these vnu subsidiaries may overlap with the audience information that is reported by the nielsen netratings internet audience measurement services 
in the event of such overlap  vnu s services could begin competing with our services for the same research budgets among customers in the marketplace  and its offering of such services could conflict with its obligation to develop and maintain our internet audience panels 
our business may be harmed if we supply inaccurate information to our customers if we furnish inaccurate information to our customers  our brand may be harmed 
the information in our databases  like that in any database  may contain inaccuracies that our customers may not accept 
any dissatisfaction by our customers with our measurement methodologies  databases or delayed releases of data could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers and could ultimately harm our brand 
our customer contracts generally provide that each customer must indemnify us for any damages arising from the use of data  reports or analyses by the customer or the performance of any consulting  analytic or other services by us 
however  we cannot be certain that our contract provisions provide sufficient protection 
any liability that we incur or any harm to our brand that we suffer because of irregularities or inaccuracies in the data we supply to our customers could harm our business 
system failures or delays may harm our business  and our facilities and internal computer operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
a failure of our network could impede the processing of data  customer orders and day to day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data 
our internal computer operations are located in leased facilities in san jose  california  in an area that is susceptible to earthquakes 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant network capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if this location experienced a system failure  our online services would become unavailable to our customers until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks 
these systems are also vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
we intend to develop back up systems outside of san jose  however  as we replicate our systems at other locations  we will face a number of technical challenges  particularly with respect to database replications  which we may not be able to address successfully 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in recent months  the western united states and california in particular has experienced repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
a delay or discontinuation of our server hosting service could harm our business the servers on which we collect panel members data are maintained by abovenet at its facilities located in san jose  california 
abovenet continually monitors our current utilization rate and the extent of our system capacity needs 
we believe we are currently operating at utilization levels that do not require additional capacity 
accordingly  our ability to collect internet audience data in real time is dependent upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of abovenet s computer and communications hardware and software systems 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at abovenet s facility could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers 
in addition  any failure by abovenet to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
in the past  we have experienced occasional minor interruptions in service from abovenet  although we have never experienced a significant interruption in service due to failures at abovenet 
in the event of a delay in the delivery of data from abovenet  or if abovenet should discontinue its services to us  we would be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services 
such a transfer could result in significant delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers  which could damage our reputation and harm our business 
we are subject to pending legal proceedings we are subject to pending lawsuits 
see item legal proceedings 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
notwithstanding these laws  we may be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights or in obtaining patents or registered trademarks for which we apply 
we have applied for a us patent with respect to our bannertrack advertising tracking technology 
we have applied to register the netratings  netratings insight  netratings online observer  bannertrack and commercetrack trademarks in the united states and have received notice of registration for netratings and netratings online observer 
we have undertaken only limited actions to protect our trademarks  servicemarks or tradenames outside of the united states and we have not registered our copyrights 
our patent applications or trademark registrations may not be approved or  even if approved  could be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
if our patent applications or trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own rights to the technology we are trying to patent or the trademarks we are trying to register  our use of such technology or trademark would be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with the third party owners  which might not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we might face intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
for example  on march   jupiter media metrix filed a suit against us and another  unaffiliated company in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of us patent no 
 see item legal proceedings 
any claims of this type  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
license agreements may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and the assertion or prosecution of any infringement claims could significantly harm our business 
any misappropriation of personal information about our panelists that is stored on our computers could harm our reputation or expose us to claims arising from damages suffered by those panelists personal information regarding our panelists is included in the data that our software captures from a panelist s internet use 
our panel data are released only in an aggregated format or in a form that is not identifiable on an individual basis 
however  if a person were to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate sensitive data about our panel members  our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by panel members as a result of such misappropriation 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or harm our operating results we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of an acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
companies in which we invest may not be successful in executing their business strategies and we may be required to write off all or part of our investment 
we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions or investments successfully  or to integrate successfully any acquisitions with our current business 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could harm our business 
governmental regulation of the internet might harm our business the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
in addition  governmental authorities in various countries may seek to further regulate the internet with respect to issues such as user privacy  pornography  acceptable content  e commerce  taxation  and the pricing  characteristics and quality of products and services 
finally  the global nature of the internet could subject us to the laws of a foreign jurisdiction in an unpredictable manner 
any new legislation regulating the internet could inhibit the growth of the internet and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications and commercial medium  which might harm our business 
delaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make more difficult the acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest  or otherwise  and the removal of incumbent officers and directors 
these provisions include section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a merger with a or greater stockholder  such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer  until three years after that party became a or greater stockholder  the authorization in the certificate of incorporation of undesignated preferred stock  which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover  and provisions in our bylaws eliminating stockholders rights to call a special meeting of stockholders and requiring advance notice of any stockholder nominations of director candidates or any stockholder proposal to be presented at an annual meeting  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our board or to vote to repeal any of the anti takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
our short term investments may decline if market interest rates increase  however  changes in interest rates have not resulted in a material decline in fair value to date 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our outstanding notes payable and capital lease obligations are all at fixed interest rates and therefore have minimal exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
netratings writes down its equity investments based on its share of the net losses recorded by its joint ventures 
the net loss of those entities are impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates could materially impact the joint venture losses recorded by netratings
