general business and strategic overview cyberoptics corporation designs and manufactures intelligent sensors and systems for high precision  non contact dimensional measurement and process control for the electronic assembly and semiconductor fabrication vertical markets 
utilizing proprietary laser  machine vision and optics technology combined with advanced software and electronics  the company s products enable manufacturers to increase operating efficiencies  product yields and quality by measuring the characteristics and placement of components during production processes 
the company generates approximately of its revenues from the sales and service of sensors and system products used primarily in surface mount technology smt circuit board production 
consequently  revenues are highly dependent on the level of capital spending in the global smt assembly market  which began to experience a slowdown in early that lasted through the first half of the slowdown in worldwide demand for smt production equipment was more pronounced in the asian markets and had a significant impact on the level of orders from large oem customers 
during the second half of and throughout the smt market has significantly strengthened  resulting in higher revenues and order rates 
during  the company significantly increased revenues from the sales of sensors to the semiconductor capital equipment market  as semiconductor product group revenues grew to approximately of total revenue 
this growth is the result of a strategic initiative to enter the semiconductor capital equipment market started in with the acquisition of certain assets of hama laboratories 
during  the company made an additional investment to further strengthen its position in this market by acquiring imagenation corporation in october imagenation  designs and manufactures machine vision components and subsystems for the semiconductor and general purpose machine vision markets  and has focused its strategy and new product development on products for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
as of the acquisition date  imagenation had two products under development that resulted in a non tax deductible charge for in process research and development of million 
results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues effective january   the company adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
prior to adoption of sab  revenue was generally recognized upon shipment 
consistent with the guidelines provided in sab no 
 the company changed its revenue recognition policy to defer elements of certain systems sales relating to installation  training  and other contractually obligated post sale service support  until the service has been performed 
the impact of adopting the provisions of sab no 
was a  cumulative effect charge  net of tax  effective january  revenues increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product group page oem solutions electronic assembly sensors    semiconductor products    smt systems    total    revenues from electronic assembly sensors product group increased million or during compared to  and decreased  or during compared to during  revenues for electronic assembly sensors  primarily the company s laseralign and laser lead locator sensors  grew dramatically as recovering demand in asian markets continued  and markets throughout the world experienced high levels of growth 
during  revenues from electronic assembly sensors  were negatively impacted in the first part of the year by slow demand in asian markets 
although asian demand strengthened throughout the second half of  full year revenues were slightly below the impact of reduced demand in asia during was partially offset by increased revenues generated in europe  where revenues increased throughout revenues from the semiconductor product group including revenues from imagenation for semiconductor and other applications and revenues from several divested product lines used in other industrial measurement applications increased or million in compared to  following an increase of million or in compared to post acquisition revenues from imagenation contributed million to the revenue increase  while a full years revenue from hama in the year after acquisition contributed million of the revenue growth 
these gains in were partially offset by the loss of revenues from industrial measurement product lines that were divested in the increase in compared to was due to million in revenue generated by hama since the acquisition in may hama s full year revenues  only the post acquisition component of which is included in the company s consolidated revenues  increased in compared to hama s revenues are generated from a line of wafer mapping and alignment sensors used in the semiconductor fabrication process  and represent the company s entry into that market 
smt systems revenues increased million or during compared to  following an increase of million or during compared to smt systems revenues are generated from sales of the company s solder paste inspection systems the se formerly the cybersentry and lsm formerly lsm  which were introduced in their current versions during the first half of  the se which was introduced during  and the ks introduced in late the se and ks generated initial revenues in the fourth quarter of increased smt systems revenues in and were the result of increased demand from electronic manufacturing services ems companies  which are becoming an increasingly large segment of the worldwide smt production market 
the company is continuing to see the demand for inspection equipment increase as production becomes more difficult due to smaller component sizes and increased production speeds 
smt systems revenues are expected to continue to increase in as the first full year of revenue for the new se  ks  and ks products 
international revenue totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising  and of total revenue  respectively 
the international markets of europe  japan and the rest of asia account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for the company s oem sensor and smt system product lines 
gross margin gross margin increased to of sales in from in and in gross margin is highly dependent on the volume of revenues over which to spread the fixed component of cost of sales and the related realization of manufacturing efficiencies 
during  gross margin was positively impacted by higher revenue levels  by lower warranty costs and by increased revenue from the semiconductor product group  which has revenues that carry higher gross margins than the majority of the company s other products 
these improvements in gross margin were offset somewhat by costs associated with rapidly increasing production rates  such as additional overtime and increased scrap and inventory disposals 
during  gross margin was positively impacted relative to by a shift in the oem sensor revenue mix towards higher margin sensor products and by a partial year of revenues from the hama acquisition 
page research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in  compared to and in and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to was primarily the result of approximately  of funded development recognized as a reduction in research and development expenses 
this reduction was partially offset by the full year impact of the acquisition of kestra and hama in the second quarter of and by other development initiatives in the eas sensor and semiconductor product groups 
increased research and development expense in is due primarily to the acquisition of kestra in april and increased development spending required to complete new smt systems products introduced in payments to the company for customer funded research and development are deferred and recognized as a reduction of research and development expenses as costs are incurred 
there was no customer funded research and development in or during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on completion of the new high speed solder paste inspection system  the se  completion of the in process technologies acquired from kestra r and hama  enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor product family  completion of the next generation of the laseralign products and development of a board alignment camera 
during  research and development expenses also related to the continued development of the in process technologies acquired from imagenation 
during  research and development efforts were primarily focused on continuing development work on the laseralign technology  including the next generation of laseralign products  completion of the new family of industrial measurement scan stations and sensors and development of additional future product offerings for solder paste inspection 
the company expects that research and development expenses will approximate percent of revenues in future periods and therefore that expenditures for research and development will expand commensurate with the growth of the company s operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in and the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to personnel and marketing investments made to develop the end user sales and service channel  the full year impact of the kestra and hama acquisitions and increased selling commissions and performance bonuses 
during  the dollar increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional costs incurred at kestra and hama  and the costs associated with operating two remote subsidiaries 
acquired in process research and development and other on october   the company acquired imagenation r corporation imagenation 
at the time of acquisition  imagenation had two products under development 
the first is a new generation of frame grabber bluebird that  if successfully developed  will contain features that greatly exceed the performance of current products 
the second is a machine vision product concept that  if successfully developed  will integrate all vision components on a single circuit board visioncell tm  to be used as a wafer mapper primarily in a semiconductor manufacturing environment and other potential applications 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either bluebird or visioncell would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for semiconductor wafer handling  or other applications  or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a million charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge is not deductible  for income tax reporting purposes 
page during the fourth quarter of  the company made a decision to abandon the development of the firstcheck tm product line  using technology originally acquired in accordingly  intangible assets with a net book value of  were deemed to be impaired and were written off 
on april   the company completed the acquisition of kestra r ltd 
at the time of the acquisition  kestra had products under development using a statistical technique  principal component analysis pca  for the application of automated optical inspection aoi in the pre oven and post oven reflow stages of smt production 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either application would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for circuit board production or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a million charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge is not deductible for tax purposes under uk law 
the company released the pre oven system to the market in the fourth quarter of  following extended technical evaluations by customers  and continued to enhance the product to attempt to meet customer specifications through the first half of the company recognized the first revenues from this acquired in process technology in the fourth quarter of the company is continuing development of the in process post reflow technology and has introduced a related product  the ks the company is considering additional product offerings for both pre oven and post oven applications in on may   the company acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of hama laboratories through hama tm sensors  inc  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
at the time of the acquisition  hama had under development technology to develop laser based proximity sensors for robotic semiconductor wafer handling in a vacuum environment  and laser micrometers that determine the orientation and alignment of semiconductor wafers during the production process and other potential applications 
at the time of acquisition the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed for either the vacuum proximity sensors or the laser micrometers would ultimately meet the technical specifications required for semiconductor wafer handling  or other applications  or be commercially acceptable 
the company recorded a  charge to operations for the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development 
this charge will be deductible  for income tax reporting purposes  in future periods 
development has been completed on the vacuum sensor and the custom kit micrometer and these products were introduced during the fourth quarter of in addition  the mini laser micrometer was introduced in the second quarter of the company has put on hold development of the acquired in process technologies related to the six inch micrometer due to manufacturability issues 
these factors could impact the product development and release schedule 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets was million during the amortization is attributable to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill resulting from the company s acquisition of certain technology and other assets of electronic packaging company epc during the first quarter of  the company s acquisition of kestra and hama during the second quarter of  and the company s acquisition of imagenation in the fourth quarter of except for the impact of contengent consideration relative to the hama and imagenation acquisitions  the amount of which is not yet determinable  amortization of these intangible assets is expected to remain constant at approximately million per year over the remaining life of the intangible assets and goodwill  which ranges from to years 
page effective tax rate the company recorded a tax provision of million in resulting in an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of the non deductible  in process research and development write off resulting from the imagenation acquisition  non deductible goodwill amortization  and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carry forwards generated by cyberoptics uk  ltd 
formerly kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
these items were partially offset by foreign sales corporation benefits and research and development tax credits 
during  the company recorded a tax provision of million despite generating a loss before income tax of million 
the tax provision during reflects the non deductible acquired in process research and development charge resulting from the kestra acquisition  non deductible goodwill amortization from the intangible assets related to the kestra acquisition and valuation allowances established to eliminate the future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards generated by kestra following the acquisition due to uncertainty about realization 
these items were partially offset in by benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation and research and development tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate was in benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation and the use of the research and development tax credit were primarily responsible for reducing the effective tax rate below the statutory federal rate in financial instruments the company invests excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  at the direction of management  manages the portfolio 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  the portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of approximately one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
the company estimates that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of the portfolio of marketable securities of approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  the company s net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to million of cash generated by operations and of cash provided by other common stock related financing activities 
these sources of cash were partially offset by million of cash used to acquire businesses and million used to purchase fixed assets 
the company generated million of cash from operations during  primarily due to net income of million plus million of non cash charges for ipr d  depreciation and amortization and the provision for inventory obsolescence  and a million tax benefit from exercise of stock options 
the cash generated from operations also included an increase of million in accounts payable and an increase of million of accrued expenses partially offset by an increase of million in accounts receivables  and a million increase in inventories 
the changes in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  inventories  and accounts receivable are primarily due to increased activity levels during related to revenue growth 
the company generated million of cash from operations during  primarily due to the net loss of million  offset by million of non cash charges for ipr d  depreciation and amortization and the provision for inventory obsolescence 
the cash generated from operations also included a decrease of  in inventories and a  increase in accounts payable 
these increases in cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in inventories is primarily due to management initiatives to reduce inventories in the changes in accounts payable and accounts receivable are primarily due to increased activity levels during the second half of related to revenue growth 
page the company used million of cash for investing activities in compared to generating million in cash used in investing activities in includes million for acquired businesses and million for acquired fixed assets  and the net purchase of an additional million of marketable securities 
cash generated from investing activity in includes million from the change in the level of investment in marketable securities resulting from purchases and maturities of those securities  which was mostly offset by the use of million of cash to purchase businesses and technology and million used for the purchase of fixed assets and other intangibles 
the company generated million of cash from financing activities in  and used million during  all of the cash was generated by stock related transactions  primarily stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan share purchases 
during  cash used primarily reflects the repayment of million of debt of kestra following the acquisition  partially offset by cash generated from stock option exercises and the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
the company has made no material capital commitments  although management is seeking strategic acquisition candidates that it believes will provide a higher level of return on assets to stockholders 
the company believes current working capital and anticipated funds from operations will be adequate for anticipated operating needs 
other factors changes in revenues have resulted primarily from changes in the level of unit shipments and new product introductions 
the company believes that inflation has not had any significant effect on operations 
all of the company s international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not effect the company s revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of the company s products relative to other technologies and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
as a result of the kestra acquisition the company has an operating unit located in the uk 
the company does not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements recent accounting developments in june the fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 is effective for the company in the first quarter of the year beginning january  management believes that the adoption of sfas will not have an impact on the company s operating results
