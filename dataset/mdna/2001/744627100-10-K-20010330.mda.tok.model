overview publicard  through its infineer subsidiaries  is a smart card technology company  which provides infrastructure products and solutions to facilitate secure access and transactions 
the company s products and solutions include integrated circuits  smart card readers and software systems 
publicard sells its products and solutions to customers for deployment in enterprise and on line security and transactions management applications 
in may of  publicard unveiled its new corporate brand of infineer bringing together its subsidiaries located in northern ireland and the united states under a single focus in an effort to capitalize on its core competencies and growth opportunities in smart card technology 
publicard established its presence within the smart card industry through a series of acquisitions o in february  publicard acquired  through a joint venture arrangement in greenwald intellicard  the assets and intellectual property of intellicard systems  ltd 
greenwald intellicard provides smart cards  smart card readers  value transfer stations  card management software and machine interface boards for the commercial laundry appliance industry 
publicard initially owned of greenwald intellicard  and acquired the remaining in february and february o in november  publicard acquired tritheim which develops conditional access and security products for the software industry  computers and the electronic information and digital video broadcast  also known as dvb  industry 
o in february  publicard acquired amazing a developer of consumer smart card solutions and a manufacturer of customized smart cards 
o in february  publicard acquired greystone a developer of hard disk duplicators 
o in november  publicard acquired absec a designer of closed environment solutions  including small value electronic cash systems and database management solutions 
through absec  publicard provides systems for closed populations to allow individual user access  unique rights and monitoring 
while publicard developed a number of successful smart card products and solutions  its operations were fragmented throughout a variety of markets 
publicard s board of directors  together with its management team  determined to integrate its operations and focus on a single market in which o high growth potential exists  o publicard has established relationships  o publicard has already deployed products and gained credibility  and o publicard possesses core technologies and competencies 
publicard determined that it could leverage its existing smart card technology for deployment in the rapidly growing enterprise and on line security  and transaction management market sectors  which publicard had already penetrated and which it believed exhibited each of the characteristics identified above 
to effect this new business strategy  in march  the company s board of directors adopted a plan to dispose of the operations of the company s greenwald  greenwald intellicard  greystone and amazing subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries design  manufacture and distribute mechanical and smart card laundry solutions  hard disk duplicators and smart cards 
on june   the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of greenwald and greenwald intellicard to eastern for million in cash less million held in escrow to secure the payment of certain indemnification obligations 
as part of the transaction  eastern assumed certain liabilities of greenwald and greenwald intellicard  including certain contractual liabilities  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company has substantially completed the wind down of the operations of amazing and greystone including the sale of certain assets and the licensing of certain intellectual property 
in december  the company acquired a ownership interest in tecsec for million 
tecsec  a virginia company  develops and markets smart card based encryption products and solutions  which will enable the next generation information security for the enterprise  multi enterprise e business and other markets 
presentation the results of operations for the three years ended december  reflect greenwald  greenwald intellicard  amazing and greystone as discontinued operations 
in addition  the results of operations for tritheim and absec have been reflected in the financial statements from their respective acquisition dates 
sales revenues are generated from infrastructure product sales  licenses of software products  maintenance contracts and software development services 
revenue from product sales is recorded upon shipment of the product 
provisions are recorded for estimated warranty repairs  returns and bad debts at the time the product is shipped 
software license fees are recognized upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue from maintenance and support fees are recognized ratably over the contract period 
cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales consists primarily of third party contract manufacturing costs  material  personnel costs and overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and travel costs  public relations  trade shows and marketing materials 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel and travel costs  independent consultants and contract engineering services 
the company believes that a significant level of development expenditures are required to enable it to quickly introduce new solutions that incorporate the latest technological advances and to develop and maintain close relationships with key suppliers of components and technologies 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and to introduce new solutions on a timely basis that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance and accounting  human resources  risk management and legal

liquidity the company has financed its operations over the last three years primarily through the sale of capital stock and the sale of non core businesses 
during the year ended december   cash  including short term investments  decreased by million to million as of december  operating activities from continuing operations utilized cash of million in and principally consisted of the loss from continuing operations of million and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of million offset by non cash charges of million for goodwill amortization  stock compensation expense and depreciation 
operating activities from discontinued operations utilized cash of million 
investing activities generated cash of million in and consisted principally of net proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of the company s greenwald and greenwald intellicard subsidiaries 
this was offset by the company s investment in tecsec of million and capital expenditures from continuing and discontinuing operations of  and  respectively 
financing activities provided cash of million in and consisted of proceeds from the issuance of class a preferred stock and common stock of million and the exercise of options to purchase common stock of million offset by the repayment of notes payable from discontinued operations of  during  the company s capital expenditures from continuing operations totaled  the company anticipates that its level of capital expenditures for will appoximate as the company continues to expand its global efforts to provide smart card solutions and products worldwide 
the company has not entered into any material commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures and has the ability to increase or decrease capital expenditure levels as required 
the company anticipates that it will be able to fund its capital expenditures during with its available cash resources as well as through capital equipment financing 
the company has experienced negative cash flow from operating activities in the past and expects to experience negative cash flow in and future uses of cash include the following o the company will incur expenditures to support the expansion of sales and marketing efforts  new product development  working capital growth and capital expenditures 
also  there will be a need to fund new initiatives in the smart card market before there is a reasonable expectation to derive any significant revenues from this market 
o in april  a consent decree the consent decree among the company  the united states environmental protection agency and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep was entered by the court which resolved all of the united states and padep s claims against the company for recovery of costs incurred in responding to releases of hazardous substances at a facility previously owned and operated by the company 
pursuant to the consent decree  the company will pay a total of million plus interest to the united states and commonwealth of pennsylvania 
through december   the company has made principal payments aggregating million 
further payments totaling million  including interest  will be made to the united states environmental protection agency in the amounts of  due april and  due april o the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan  which was frozen in as of december   the actuarial present value of accrued liabilities exceeded the plan assets by approximately million 
the annual contribution to the plan is expected to be approximately million in and beyond 
the company believes that its current cash balance will satisfy working capital  new product development  sales and marketing expansion and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
although the company has generated funds to meet its cash requirements in the past and expects to be able to generate funds to meet its obligations and other needs enumerated above  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when required 
as of december   approximately million of us tax loss carryforwards subject to review by the internal revenue service  expiring from through  were available to offset future taxable income 
due to the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income in future periods could be subject to an annual limitation if a change in ownership for income tax purposes occurs 
factors that may affect future results we have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow  and we have ongoing funding obligations 
we have incurred losses and experienced negative cash flow from operating activities in the past  and we expect to incur losses and experience negative cash flow from operating activities in the foreseeable future 
we incurred losses from continuing operations in  and  of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we experienced negative cash flow from continuing operating activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect that our business will require on going funding to support the expansion of sales and marketing efforts  new product development  working capital growth and capital expenditures 
also  we will need to fund our new initiatives in the smart card market before we can reasonably expect to derive any significant revenues from this market 
we also have continuing obligations to fund payments due under the consent decree and an underfunded pension plan 
as of december   we were required to make future aggregate payments of million through april in connection with the consent decree 
consistent with the general practices of environmental enforcement agencies  the consent decree does not eliminate our potential liability for remediation of contamination that had not been known at the time of the settlement 
we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan  which was frozen in as of december   the present value of the accrued benefit liabilities of our pension plan exceeded the plan s assets by approximately million 
in addition to the million we expect to contribute to the plan in  we are obligated to make continued contributions to the plan in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the employee retirement income security act of future contribution levels depend in large measure on the mortality rate of plan participants and the investment return on the plan assets 
we have limited experience in the smart card market 
we have only recently begun to provide smart card infrastructure products and solutions which facilitate secure access and transactions 
we are therefore subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new business enterprise 
our business model is new and unproven and may not generate sufficient revenue for us to be successful 
the volume of products and services distributed using our technology may be too small to support or grow our business 
our future profitability depends largely upon products and future products that have not yet produced any revenues or are not yet commercially viable 
we believe that certain of our products are viable  but have not yet generated any material sales 
our future revenues and earnings depend in large part on the success of these products 
our business is also based on products not yet developed 
there are no assurances that these products will be developed into working products or that a market will develop for these products in the future 
the market s acceptance of our products is uncertain 
demand for  and market acceptance of  our smart card reader  asic and software solutions are subject to a high level of uncertainty due to rapidly changing technology  new product introductions and changes in customer requirements and preferences 
the success of our products or any future products also depends upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and technologies to meet customer requirements 
we face the risk that our current and future products will not achieve market acceptance 
our solutions are designed to provide secure electronic commerce  access control and security for various digital platforms 
the markets for secure access and transaction management applications are still emerging and if the benefits are not perceived sufficient or if alternative technologies are more widely accepted then the demand for our solutions may not grow and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely effected 
we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a majority of our revenues 
we rely on a limited number of customers in our business 
the asics we provide to motorola s general instruments for inclusion in its set top boxes accounted for of our total revenue in we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a majority of the revenues in our business 
approximately  of the company s accounts receivable balance as of december  was represented by a single customer 
for the year ended december   no customer represented more than of the company s sales and one customer represented approximately of the accounts receivable balance as of december  we generally do not enter into long term supply commitments with our customers 
instead  we bid on a project basis and have supply contracts in place for each project 
significant reductions in sales to any of our largest customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable and inventory balances in connection with providing products to our customers 
a customer s inability to pay for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend on third party manufacturers who are outside of our control 
we outsource manufacturing needs of a significant portion of our products to third party contract manufacturers 
outsourcing of manufacturing involves risks with respect to quality assurance  cost and the absence of engineering support 
in addition  financial  operational or supply problems encountered by the third party manufacturers we use or may use in the future  their subcontractors or their suppliers could result in our inability to obtain timely delivery  if at all  of finished products 
any such difficulties would adversely affect our financial results 
we have a limited number of suppliers of key components 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key components for our products 
for example  we purchase embedded chips for asics exclusively from the atmel corporation 
our reliance on one supplier could impose several risks  including an inadequate supply of chips  price increases  long lead times  late deliveries and poor quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of these chips could delay the delivery of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on business and operating results 
these delays could damage our relationship with current and prospective customers 
our future success depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and introduce new products in a timely manner 
the rate of technological change currently affecting the smart card market is particularly rapid compared to other industries 
our ability to anticipate these trends and adapt to new technologies is critical to our success 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of actual sales  new product decisions must anticipate future demand as well as the speed and direction of technological change 
our ability to remain competitive will depend upon our ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced products at competitive prices 
new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and lower profit margins 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including o product selections  o timely and efficient completion of product design and development  o timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes  o effective sales  service and marketing  o price  and o product performance in the field 
our ability to develop new products also depends upon the success of our research and development efforts 
our research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were million and we may need to devote substantially more resources to our research and development efforts in the future 
we cannot assure you that these expenditures will lead to the development of viable products 
the highly competitive markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
we compete against numerous companies  many of which have greater resources than we do  and we believe that competition is likely to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting us are o the extent to which products support industry standards and are capable of being operated or integrated with other products  o technical features and level of security  o strength of distribution channels  o price  o product reputation  reliability  quality  performance and customer support  o product features such as adaptability  functionality and ease of use  and o competitor reputation  positioning and resources 
we cannot assure you that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  sales  customer support  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed base of their products and technologies than our company 
additionally  there can be no assurance that new competitors will not enter our markets 
increased competition would likely result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the market for smart card products and solutions is new  intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
we expect competition to continue to increase with both our existing competitors and new market entrants 
our primary competition currently comes from or is anticipated to come from o companies offering payment solutions  including trintech and verifone  o companies offering smart card technology solutions  including gemplus  philips and scm microsystems  and o companies offering closed environment solutions  including small value electronic cash systems and database management solutions  such as girovend  mars  diebold  cybermark and schlumberger 
many of our current and potential competitors have broader customer relationships that could be leveraged  including relationships with many of our customers 
these companies also have more established customer support and professional services organizations than we do 
in addition  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to increase their presence by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors  resulting in increased competition 
our long product sales cycles subject us to risk 
our products fall into two categories  those that are standardized and ready to install and use and those that require significant development efforts to implement within the purchasers own systems 
those products requiring significant development efforts tend to be newly developed technologies and software applications that can represent major investments for customers 
we rely on potential customers internal review processes and systems requirements 
the implementation of some of our products involves deliveries of small quantities for pilot programs and significant testing by the customers before firm orders are received for production volumes  or lengthy beta testing of software solutions 
for these more complex products  the sales process may take one year or longer  during which time we may expend significant financial  technical and management resources  without any certainty of a sale 
we may be limited in our use of our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards  subject to review by the internal revenue service  totaling approximately million for federal income tax purposes  approximately million of which will expire at the end of and million of which will expire at the end of we do not expect to earn any significant taxable income prior to  and may not do so until later 
a federal net operating loss can generally be carried back two or three years and then forward fifteen or twenty years depending on the year in which the loss was incurred  and used to offset taxable income earned by a company and thus reduce its income tax liability 
section of the internal revenue code provides that when a company undergoes an ownership change  the corporation s use of its net operating losses is limited in each subsequent year 
an ownership change occurs when  as of any testing date  the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company s stock as compared to that shareholder s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding three year period exceeds fifty percentage points 
for purposes of this rule  certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company s stock are aggregated and treated as a single five percent shareholder 
we intend to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in connection with public and private offerings in the future 
in addition  the exercise of outstanding warrants and options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock 
the issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock could result in an ownership change 
if we were to experience such an ownership change  we estimate that we would not be able to use a substantial amount of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income 
the extent of the actual future use of our federal net operating loss carryforwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn 
we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our federal net operating loss carryforwards before they would otherwise expire 
our proprietary technology is difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
we currently have a number of patent applications pending 
we cannot assure you that any of our applications will be approved  that any new patents will be issued  that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable  that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if our technology or products is determined to infringe upon the rights of others  and we were unable to obtain licenses to use the technology  we could be required to cease using the technology and stop selling the products 
we may not be able to obtain a license in a timely manner on acceptable terms or at all 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
patent disputes are common in technology related industries 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights action 
as the number of products and competitors in the smart card market grows  the likelihood of infringement claims also increases 
any claim or litigation may be time consuming and costly  cause product shipment delays or require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to use our proprietary information and software 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary and intellectual property rights may not be adequate 
there is a risk that our competitors will independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around patents or other intellectual property rights 
if third parties do not deploy our technology and create a market for digital commerce  our business will be harmed 
relationships with leading content  technology and commerce service providers are critical to our success 
our business and operating results would be harmed to the extent our strategic partnerships fail  in whole or in part  too o deploy our technology  o develop an infrastructure to conduct business through e commerce  and o develop and deploy new applications 
the nature of our products subjects us to product liability risks 
our customers may rely on certain of our current products and products in development to prevent unauthorized access to digital content  computer networks  dvb and real property 
a malfunction of or design defect in certain of our products could result in tort or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of exposure from such claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our sales agreements and by maintaining product liability insurance  we cannot assure you that these measures will be effective in limiting our liability for any damages 
any liability for damages resulting from security breaches could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  a well publicized actual or perceived security breach involving our conditional access or security products could adversely affect the market s perception of our products in general  regardless of whether any breach is attributable to our products 
this could result in a decline in demand for our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we may have difficulty retaining or recruiting professionals for our business 
our future success and performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
there is a shortage of qualified marketing and technical personnel in our industry  and the competition for such personnel is intense 
accordingly  the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could materially adversely affect our business 
our business requires experienced software programmers  creative designers and application developers  and our success depends on identifying  hiring  training and retaining such experienced  knowledgeable professionals 
if a significant number of our current employees or any of our senior technical personnel resign  or for other reasons are no longer employed by us  we may be unable to complete or retain existing projects or bid for new projects of similar scope and revenues 
in addition  former employees may compete with us in the future 
even if we retain our current employees  our management must continually recruit talented professionals in order for our business to grow 
there is currently a shortage of qualified senior technical personnel in the software development field  and this shortage is likely to continue 
furthermore  there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future to sustain and grow our business  or that we will be successful in motivating and retaining the employees we are able to attract 
if we cannot attract  motivate and retain qualified professionals  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations subject us to risk associated with operating in foreign markets  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
international sales represented approximately of total sales for the year ended december  because we derive a substantial portion of our business outside the united states  we are subject to certain risks associated with operating in foreign markets including the following o tariffs and other trade barriers  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o currency exchange risks  o export controls related to encryption technology  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o changes in economic and political conditions  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
any of the foregoing could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  certain change of control agreements  our rights plan and provisions of pennsylvania law could deter takeover attempts 
blank check preferred stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock  and as a result  the issuance of the preferred stock could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
rights plan 
our rights plan entitles the registered holders of rights to purchase shares of our class a preferred stock upon the occurrence of certain events  and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
change of control agreements 
we are a party to change of control agreements which provide for payments to certain of our directors and executive officers under certain circumstances following a change of control 
since the change of control agreements require large cash payments to be made by any person effecting a change of control  these agreements may discourage takeover attempts 
the change of control agreements provide that  if the services of any person party to a change of control agreement are terminated within three years following a change of control  that individual will be entitled to receive  in a lump sum within days of the termination date  a payment equal to times that individual s average annual compensation for the shorter of the five years preceding the change of control and the period the individual received compensation from us for personal services 
assuming a change of control were to occur at the present time  payments in the following amounts would be required mr 
harry i 
freund  and mr 
jay s 
goldsmith  if any such payment  either alone or together with others made in connection with the individual s termination  is considered to be an excess parachute payment under the internal revenue code  the individual will be entitled to receive an additional payment in an amount which  when added to the initial payment  would result in a net benefit to the individual  after giving effect to excise taxes imposed by section of the internal revenue code and income taxes on such additional payment  equal to the initial payment before such additional payment 
we would not be able to deduct these payments for income tax purposes 
pennsylvania law 
we are a pennsylvania corporation 
anti takeover provisions of pennsylvania law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our stock price is extremely volatile 
the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the future trading price for our common stock will depend on a number of factors  including o variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  o general economic conditions  in particular  the technology service sector  o the volume of activity for our common stock is minimal and therefore a large number of shares placed for sale or purchase could increase its volatility  o our ability to effectively manage our business  o expected or announced relationships with other companies  o announcements of technological advances innovations or new products by us or our competitors  o patents or other proprietary rights or patent litigation  and o product liability or warranty litigation 
we cannot be certain that the market price of our common stock will not experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are adverse and unrelated to our performance 
we are subject to government regulation 
the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  which may affect our business  market participants with which we have relationships or the acceptance of interactive television in general 
in addition  future legislation or regulatory requirements regarding privacy issues could be enacted to require notification to users that captured data may be used by marketing entities to target product promotion and advertising to that user 
any of these developments may materially adversely affect our business 
federal  state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the discharge of chemicals and gases  which may be used in our present or future assembly processes 
moreover  changes in such environmental rules and regulations may require us to invest in capital equipment and implement compliance programs in the future 
any failure by our company to comply with environmental rules and regulations  including the discharge of hazardous substances  would subject us to liabilities and would materially adversely affect our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct operations in the united kingdom and sell products in several different countries 
therefore  our operating results may be impacted by the fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies  especially the british pound  in relation to the us dollar 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities with respect to our foreign currency exposure 
we continually monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and may use financial hedging techniques when appropriate to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
even so  exchange rate fluctuations may still have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are exposed to market risk primarily through short term investments
