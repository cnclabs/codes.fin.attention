during  oss sales resulted primarily from the completion of oss contracts  which were secured during the latter part of we expect to complete revenue recognition from these oss contracts in sales of oss systems are not made on a recurring basis to customers  but are the result of extended negotiations that frequently cover many months and do not always result in a contract 
in addition  oss contracts may include conditions precedent  such as the customer obtaining financing or bank approval  and the contracts are not effective until the conditions are satisfied 
line connection protection equipment sales for increased approximately  from  in to  in the improved sales level reflected an increase in volume of sales to united states and mexican customers  which were offset by a decrease in sales to customers in the united kingdom 
signal processing revenue for compared to increased by  from  to  the increase in sales primarily reflects accommodations made to customers where requested delays in deliveries in of orders were shipped during gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributed to the higher sales volume in the oss division 
however  the increase in revenue was still not satisfactory in completely eliminating the inefficiency resulting from our inability to absorb our fixed expenses associated with the oss contracts over our revenue base 
this improvement in gross margin was slightly offset by a lower gross margin in connection protection products in compared to due to changes in product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in to  in the increase from to primarily reflects higher than anticipated professional legal expenses due primarily to litigation involving us  particularly litigation and settlement of a dispute with a vendor 
research and development expenses decreased by  from  in to  in the decreased expense in resulted from the completion during of certain efforts to develop new products primarily related to the oss business 
as a result of the above  we had an operating loss of  in versus operating loss of  in the reduced operating loss for reflects continued profitability in our line connection protection equipment and signal processing divisions  and a reduction of the operating loss in our oss division from  in to  in interest expense for increased by  from  for to  in this change is attributable primarily to increased levels of borrowing from the company s senior lender and non cash interest expense associated with the issuance and re pricing of warrants held by the senior lender and subordinated note holders see notes to financial statements and of results of operations continued during  we requested the early termination of our obligations to a number of current and former executive officers regarding the funding of split dollar life insurance policies in order to obtain approximately  of premiums paid by us into the policies 
due to the early termination  we agreed to forfeit approximately  of premiums and terminate our interest in the policies which amount was charged to other expenses during as the result of the foregoing  the net loss was  per share basic and diluted  compared with a net loss of  per share basic and diluted for years ended december  and our sales for were  compared to  in  a decrease of

in addition  oss contracts may include conditions precedent  such as obtaining financing or bank approval  and the contracts are not effective until the conditions are satisfied 
during  oss sales resulted primarily from the completion of oss contracts  which were in effect at the beginning of the year 
our major new oss contracts were signed during the fourth quarter of  and had no effect on our revenue for these new contracts  which total  are with the philippines long distance telephone co 
for approximately  and fujitsu telecommunications europe ltd for approximately  we recognized substantially all revenue from these new oss contracts in line connection protection equipment sales for decreased approximately  from  in to  in the decline reflected a reduction in volume of sales to united states and mexican customers  which were not offset by an increase in sales to new customers 
signal processing revenue for compared to decreased by  from  to  the decrease in sales primarily reflects customer requested delays in deliveries in of orders which are expected to be shipped during cost of sales for the year ended december   as a percentage of sales compared to  increased from to 
the increase in cost of sales and the resulting decline in gross margin is primarily attributed to inefficiency resulting from the inability to absorb fixed expenses associated with the oss contracts over a substantially lower revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in to  in the increase relates primarily to additional accounts receivable reserve requirements on oss contracts in the far east of approximately  offset by reductions in various operating expenses

interest expense for decreased by  from  for to  in the decrease in interest expense is attributable primarily to the completion of non cash interest expenses associated with the issuance of warrants to our senior lender 
this decrease was substantially offset by additional interest on the increased outstanding principal balance and waiver fee for non compliance of the interest coverage covenant to the senior lender 
other income for included approximately  from the final settlement of an insolvency procedure involving the purchaser of our israeli operations  which was sold in  and  from the settlement of a lawsuit against a former vendor 
during  we recorded debt conversion expenses of  as a result of the exchange of zero coupon notes into common stock 
the debt conversion expense represents the difference between the original conversion price per share of and the reduced conversion price per share of 
during  we recorded an extraordinary gain from the early extinguishment of its debentures of  for  we recorded an income tax expense of  which includes an  increase in deferred tax asset valuation allowance and tax expenses of  for  income tax expenses of  primarily represents income taxes payable by our uk and chilean subsidiaries 
as the result of the foregoing  the net loss was  per share basic and diluted  compared with net income of  per share basic and per share diluted  for liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  our working capital deficit was  at december  compared to working capital of  at december  the decline in working capital was primarily a result of the classification of our senior debt and subordinated debt from long term to current liabilities 
during  we used  of cash to support our operations 
our principal source of funds during was borrowings from our senior lender 
we had senior debt outstanding of  as of december  of which  was a non interest bearing note   was outstanding against the revolving line of credit  and  was a term loan agreement 
the agreement requires a quarterly loan amortization of  porta had a revolving line of credit and a letter of credit facility of  as of december  which decreased to  on january  during  we borrowed  and repaid  to the senior secured lender  of which  was provided from the proceeds of the sale of our uk facility 
our loan and security agreement with our senior secured lender expires july  pursuant to this agreement   of the revolving line of credit matured on january  of liquidity and capital resources continued on january   we did not have the resources to make the  payment 
on march   our senior lender agreed to allow us to defer the repayment of borrowings related to the increased maximum  defer all monthly facility fees and the april  principal payment of  until the earlier of the termination of the agreement on july  or the sale by us of one or more of our divisions 
the senior lender  as a condition to the above  prohibited us from making any payments on indebtedness to any subordinated creditors except to pay accounts payable in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  we were not in compliance with the interest coverage covenant and borrowing base coverage under the agreement and obtained a waiver from our senior lender through july  as of december   we had remaining outstanding  of debentures  net of original issue discount of  which mature july  the face amount of the outstanding debentures was  the interest accrued on the debentures is payable on july of each year and as of december  was  at december   we were current on our interest obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding  of subordinated notes 
as a result of an agreement with the holders of of these notes  the maturity date of the notes was extended to july  as a result  notes in the principal amount of  were due january  and notes in the principal amount of  become due july  we did not have the resources to pay the  of subordinated debt on january  and approximately  of interest which was due on january  we are engaged in preliminary discussions with the holders of certain subordinated notes with respect to the possible extension of the notes or the exchange of the notes for equity in porta 
our cash availability during and thereafter may be affected by a number of factors 
at december   we had no cash available under our credit facility and we had borrowed more than the amount available to us under our borrowing base 
to the extent that credit is not available  we may have difficulty performing our obligations under our contracts  which could result in the cancellation of contracts or the loss of future business 
in addition   of senior debt and  of subordinated debt became due in january and  of senior and subordinated debt will become due in july under the default provisions of the loan agreement with our senior lender  a default on the subordinated notes can trigger a default in our obligations to the senior lender 
we do not presently have the ability to pay these debts and  if we cannot obtain either an extension on the maturity of the debts or an alternative financing source or raise funds from the sale of one of our divisions  we may be unable to meet these financial obligations 
we are continuing to negotiate with our senior lender with respect to an extension beyond the july  maturity of our current facility 
we are seeking to address our need for liquidity by seeking to extend our agreement with our senior lender  negotiate an agreement with the holders of the subordinated debt which would result in a deferral of our payment obligations or a conversion of the debt to equity or a combination  and a sale of one or more of our divisions 
although we have been engaged in negotiations with respect to the sale of one of our divisions  these negotiations were terminated without our entering into any agreement 
although we are continuing to explore the possible sale of one or more of our divisions  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts 
because of our present stock price  it is highly unlikely that we will be able to raise funds through the sales of our equity securities  and our financial condition prevents us from issuing debt securities 
in the event that we are unable to extend our debt obligations and sell one or more of our divisions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue in operations 
in addition  our auditors included in their report an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern 
of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk although we conduct operations outside of the united states  most of our contracts and sales are dollar denominated 
a portion of the revenue from our united kingdom operations and the majority of our united kingdom expenses are denominated in sterling 
any sterling denominated receipts are promptly converted into united states dollars 
we do not engage in any hedging or other currency transactions 
for  the currency translation adjustment was not significant in relation to our total revenue
