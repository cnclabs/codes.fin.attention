this presentation of gross bookings does not affect our operating results  and gross bookings are not included in revenues 
management believes that gross bookings provide a more consistent comparison of business activity between historical periods than do transaction fees because of changing commission rates over the periods 
gross bookings is not a financial measurement in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other information prepared in accordance with gaap  and period to period comparisons of gross bookings are not necessarily meaningful as a measure of our revenues due to  among other things  changes in commission rates  and  as with operating results  should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial position 
results of operations pro forma compared to pro forma revenues transaction revenues 
pro forma transaction revenues increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased air and non air revenues which increased and  respectively  compared to the same period last year 
pro forma gross bookings increased from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december  advertising revenues 
pro forma advertising revenues increased from million net of fees paid to doubleclick of million to million net of fees paid to doubleclick of  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to a significant increase in net revenue from our advertising revenue sharing agreement with aol and increased advertising impressions from the direct sale of advertising by our direct sales force 
using a direct sales force instead of doubleclick reduced fees paid for advertising services 
other revenues 
pro forma other revenues increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was due primarily to the company s receipt of service charges for the handling and express delivery of certain paper tickets and revenue related to certain warrants received from hrn in connection with an affiliation agreement 
costs of revenues pro forma costs of revenues increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to increases in costs associated with customer service operations and salaries and employee related costs from the increase in transactions on our web sites 
additionally  preview travel expanded its call center operations in august which further increased costs for pro forma cost of revenues declined as a percentage of total revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  costs of revenues are expected to increase from current pro forma levels as the number of transactions processed on our web sites increases 
however  we anticipate that costs of revenues as a percentage of revenues will decrease due to efficiencies gained in infrastructure costs and the ticket fulfillment process due to economies of scale 
operating expenses selling and marketing 
pro forma selling and marketing expenses increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to increased costs relating to the amortization of payments made to strategic distribution partners and additional advertising spending 
part of the increase was also due to an increase in salaries and other employee related costs to support additional direct selling efforts 
we will continue to invest a significant amount in advertising programs to build our brand 
additionally  guaranteed payments under the aol agreement will continue to result in significant distribution costs 
we expect a major portion of these costs will be offset by revenue under our advertising revenue sharing agreement with aol 
technology and development 
pro forma technology and development expenses increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to costs to enhance and maintain our transaction processing systems 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related costs  depreciation  repairs and maintenance and software licensing 
general and administrative 
pro forma general and administrative expenses increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this was due primarily to an increase in salaries and employee related costs that increased as a result of additional administrative requirements needed to support our growth and the merger 
also  following the merger  certain administrative costs were duplicative due to the integration of the administrative services of preview travel with the company 
we expect cost savings from the combined operations to lower general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
integration related expenses 
pro forma integration related expenses include costs that are specifically associated with the merger and the integration of the company with preview travel 
pro forma integration expenses increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
pro forma integration expense for represents merger related costs incurred by preview travel prior to the date of acquisition 
stock compensation 
pro forma stock compensation expense increased from million to million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was due primarily to the expense associated with the company s adoption of fin the increase was also due to the timing of stock compensation expense associated with the acceleration of vesting of stock options held by certain key former employees of preview travel  expense for unvested stock options held by former employees of sabre which were converted into the company s stock options on the date of the merger and expense for options granted to a consultant by preview travel which were assumed in the merger 
amortization of intangible assets and goodwill 
pro forma amortization of intangible assets and goodwill remained unchanged from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  anticipated losses the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception as an operating unit of sabre  and has continued to incur losses since the merger 
for the future  our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to greatly increase sales volume so as to realize economies of scale and to increase revenue from advertising and vacation packages resulting in higher gross margins 
as we increase spending for product development  advertising  customer service  facilities  international expansion and general and administrative expenses  we expect to continue to incur lower costs as a percent of revenue resulting in declining operating losses until the second quarter of  by the end of which time we expect to be at or close to cash profitability  excluding the effects of non cash stock compensation expense and the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
variability of results we expect to experience seasonality in our business  reflecting seasonal fluctuations in the travel industry  internet and commercial online service usage and advertising expenditures 
travel bookings typically increase during the first and second quarter in anticipation of summer travel and typically slow in the third and fourth quarter 
due to the significant quarterly growth of our business  this effect has not been historically evident in our operations  but may become so in the future 
internet and commercial online service usage and the rate of growth of such usage are expected to decline during the summer 
depending on the extent to which the internet and commercial online services are accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality in the level of advertising expenditures could become more pronounced for internet based advertising 
seasonality in the travel industry  internet and commercial online service usage and advertising expenditures are likely to cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other factors that may adversely affect our operating results include o our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers and encourage repeat purchases  o our ability to adequately maintain and upgrade our web sites and technical infrastructure  o our ability to obtain travel inventory from travel suppliers on satisfactory terms  particularly in competition with alliances formed by travel suppliers  o fluctuating gross margins due to a changing mix of revenues  o the amount and timing of operating costs related to expanding our operations  o general economic conditions or economic conditions specific to the internet  online commerce and the travel industry  o the seasonal nature of the travel industry  internet and commercial online service usage and advertising expenditures  o our ability to attract and retain advertisers on our web sites  and o advertising revenues from our agreement with aol may fluctuate due to the effects of seasonality 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast  and period to period comparisons of operating results will not necessarily be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used for operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily attributed to the net loss before non cash charges  sabre s interest in the partnership and the prepayment to aol  offset by depreciation and amortization 
net cash used for operating activities in was million  which was due primarily to the net loss before non cash charges  an increase in accounts receivable  and a decrease in the accounts payable to amr affiliates 
net cash used for operating activities in was million which was due to the net loss before non cash charges and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities and accounts payable to amr affiliates 
net cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
this was primarily for the purchase of marketable securities  net  of million with funds received from sabre in the merger and capital expenditures for furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements and computer equipment to support our growth during the year of million 
net cash used for investing activities in and were million and million  respectively 
for  investing activities included capital expenditures for furniture and fixtures and computer equipment 
for  investing activities included leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and computer equipment for a new facility for the customer service center 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
immediately prior to the merger  sabre contributed million in cash to the partnership and received partnership units in exchange 
additionally  the company exercised its option to cause sabre to invest an additional million in the company in exchange for million shares of common stock of the company 
the company contributed these funds to the partnership 
sabre is under no further obligation to fund the partnership s capital requirements 
effective with the merger  we began maintaining our own cash balances 
prior to the merger with preview travel  we did not maintain cash or cash equivalents  but depended upon sabre for the funding of our cash requirements 
sabre maintained all cash balances  charging or crediting us through intercompany accounts upon the recording of certain transactions  including the collection of accounts receivable and purchase of goods and services 
we incurred losses from our inception to the merger  which were funded by sabre  as we were an operating unit of sabre 
cash advances for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
all cash advances from sabre were contributed to paid in capital effective with the merger and are no longer due to sabre 
as of december   we had million in cash and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements through the second quarter of at which time the company expects to have positive cash earnings before the amortization of goodwill  intangibles and stock compensation expense 
thereafter  we anticipate that cash requirements will be funded by cash flows from operating activities 
however  we cannot provide assurance that cash flows from operations of the partnership will exist or will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements  such as contractual commitments to our strategic distribution partners  including aol and yahoo  or to make capital expenditures or other expenditures necessary to support the anticipated growth of our business or to respond to competition 
in such event  we would be required to obtain financing from the sale of equity securities or debt financing 
we cannot assure you that any such financing will be available or on terms acceptable to us 
in february  the company completed a cashless exercise of warrants granted to the company as part of the affiliation agreement with hrn see note 
in conjunction with this event  the company received approximately  shares of class a common stock of hrn 
these shares will be treated as marketable securities and recorded at fair value in future periods 
in march  the company completed a cashless exercise of additional hrn warrants 
in conjunction with this  the company recognized a loss on the exercise of approximately million 
as a result of this cashless exercise  the company received an additional  shares of hrn class a common stock 
in  we will use funds to enhance brand awareness and supplier relationships  to perform product development and for working capital 
payments due under our agreements with strategic distribution partners could also affect our liquidity 
revenues under the aol agreement are based on performance and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  they may not occur in the same time periods as payments we must make to aol 
additionally  agreements with yahoo  excite  and other distribution partners include guaranteed payments 
in connection with these agreements  we expect that the partnership will make aggregate future payments in at least the following amounts in thousands year ending december  if aol does not meet certain revenue targets  we may elect to operate under alternative terms and conditions set forth in the aol agreement and we would no longer have any payment obligations to aol 
we expect to incur capital expenditures in of to million 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas effective january  fas requires the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
at december   the company was a party to certain derivative instruments that include warrants received from hrn in connection with an affiliation agreement see note 
the company currently estimates that upon adoption of fas it will report a gain of approximately million from these warrants 
the estimated gain is based on the black scholes value of the warrants at december  and any actual gains or losses realized by the company will be dependent upon hrn s stock price at the time the hrn stock is sold 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the application of revenue recognition and the presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
we believe our current revenue recognition polices are consistent with sab in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  an interpretation of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
fin  which has been adopted prospectively by the company as of july   requires significant changes to previous practice regarding the accounting for certain stock compensation arrangements 
fin does not change apb s intrinsic value method  under which compensation expense is generally not recognized for grants of stock options to employees with an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock at the date of grant  but it has narrowed its application 
fin contains provisions whereby employees are defined the same as they are under common law for purposes of applying apb as a result  apb does not apply in the separate financial statements of a subsidiary for equity awards made by the subsidiary to employees of the parent company  as these employees are not considered to be employees of the grantor 
grants of equity awards made to such employees are required to be recorded at fair value and recognized as expense over the vesting period in the separate financial statements of the subsidiary 
such grants are required to be revalued to fair value at each periodic reporting date until vesting is complete  with a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized for any changes in fair value 
for the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million of expense related to fin cautionary statement statements in this report which are not purely historical facts  including statements regarding the company s anticipations  beliefs  expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies for the future  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

a decline in commission rates or the elimination of commissions by airlines and other travel suppliers would reduce our revenues 
a substantial portion of our revenue comes from the commissions paid by travel suppliers for bookings made through our online travel services 
we do not have written commission agreements with most travel suppliers and accordingly  consistent with industry practices  these travel suppliers are not obligated to pay any specified commission rates for bookings made through our web sites or to pay commissions at all 
if airlines  hotel chains or other travel suppliers reduce current industry commission rates or eliminate commissions entirely  our revenues would be significantly reduced 
we cannot provide assurances that airlines  hotel chains or other travel suppliers will not reduce current industry commission rates or eliminate commissions entirely  either of which could reduce our revenues and margins  and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently  northwest airlines and its alliance partner klm announced the elimination of commissions paid by them for tickets booked through the internet 
as a result of such action  we are now charging a fee for all tickets booked on our web sites for northwest airlines and klm 
the imposition of the fee may discourage our consumers from purchasing such tickets from our web sites 
some consumers may choose to purchase tickets for northwest airlines and klm through a different vendor or from northwest airlines and klm s own web sites 
if other airlines or other travel suppliers discontinue payment of commissions for tickets booked through the internet and  in turn  force us to charge a service fee  we could lose a large portion of our customers and consequently experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have also discontinued offering reservation booking capabilities for southwest airlines co 
on our web sites 
however  we do not expect that such action will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
travel industry consolidation  including the formation of strategic alliances and consortia to replace travel agencies  may harm our competitive position 
we depend greatly on our relationships with airlines and other travel suppliers  and adverse changes in these relationships could affect the inventory of travel products available on our web sites 
travel suppliers  including travel content providers  may not make their services and products available to us on satisfactory terms or at all  or may choose to provide their products and services only to our competitors 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our travel suppliers will continue to sell products and services through global distribution systems on terms satisfactory to us 
it is possible that in connection with industry consolidation  strategic alliances or other travel supplier consortia  airlines and other travel suppliers may choose not to distribute their travel products and services through online distribution sites such as ours 
airlines and other travel suppliers could decide to sell their travel products and services exclusively through other distribution channels or to otherwise restrict our access to their travel products and inventory 
either situation could significantly reduce the volume or breadth of travel products and services available on our web sites 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with airlines and other travel suppliers  our ability to offer and expand our travel service offerings or offer the lowest priced travel inventory could be reduced and our sales and revenues could be materially adversely affected 
several major airline carriers have formed a joint sales agency known as orbitz  which operates as an online travel reservations service and currently plans to begin sales in june pursuant to agreements among the carriers and orbitz  orbitz will obtain favorable and in some cases exclusive access to certain airline fares and inventory and will enjoy other rights and benefits  including most favored nations privileges  not currently enjoyed by independent travel agencies such as the company 
the us department of justice  the us department of transportation and the attorneys general of twenty one states and the territory of puerto rico  are currently investigating whether these agreements and arrangements violate antitrust or aviation laws  however  we cannot assure you that these investigations will be resolved on terms satisfactory to the company 
if orbitz is able to use its agreements with such carriers  and its other rights and benefits from them  to create a more comprehensive product or service offering than the company  our sales and revenues could be materially adversely affected 
adverse changes or interruptions in our relationships with distribution partners and other third party service providers could reduce our revenues 
we rely on yahoo  aol  excite  home and other distribution partners for a significant amount of our customers 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with yahoo  aol or excite  or if these companies are unable to maintain their positive market presence and reputation and steer online traffic to our web sites  our sales and revenue could decline  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
any discontinuance in the services provided to us by third parties  such as global distribution systems providers  web hosting providers and others  or any deterioration or interruption of their services  would prevent consumers from accessing or purchasing particular travel services through our web sites  which would reduce our sales and revenues and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the revenues derived from our relationships with companies such as yahoo and aol may not be sufficient to offset our significant financial commitments to those companies 
we may not be able to achieve sufficient online traffic  travel bookings or commissions to justify our significant financial obligations to yahoo and aol under various agreements 
under these agreements  we expect to pay at least million to yahoo over a three year period and at least million to aol over a five year period 
in addition  our financial obligations under these agreements may limit our operational flexibility in the future  which could materially affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
conflicts of interest with sabre could impede our business strategy and hurt our business 
sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates currently own of the company s issued and outstanding common stock and million shares of the company s class a common stock  which are convertible into shares of common stock 
if all of the class a common stock were converted  sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates ownership of the company s issued and outstanding common stock would increase from to approximately 
there is no limit on the ability of sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates to purchase shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
as a result of their stock ownership  sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates exercise control over the company and have the power to influence the election of a majority of the directors of the company  the appointment of the company s management and the approval of actions requiring a vote of the company s stockholders 
currently  five of the company s directors are either directors or officers of sabre holdings corporation 
sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates interests may conflict with the interests of the company or the company s other stockholders 
sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates could use their voting power to delay or prevent a change in control  even if it is in the best interest of the company to effect such change in control or if a majority of the company s other stockholders were in favor of such change 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates and the company will be able to fairly resolve any potential conflicts of interest that may arise between them  whether in connection with the intercompany agreements between the parties or otherwise  or that any resolution will be as favorable to the company as if it were dealing with an unaffiliated party 
because we are affiliated with sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates  potential strategic partners or vendors may not wish to enter into strategic relationships with us 
because of our affiliation with sabre holdings corporation and its affiliates  potential strategic partners or vendors may not wish to enter  or may be contractually prohibited from entering into or expanding strategic relationships with us 
if too many potential strategic partners were to decline strategic relationships with us  or if vendors were to limit their dealings with us because of our affiliation with sabre  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to increase our brand recognition among consumers  we may not be able to attract new members and increase our revenues 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the travelocity brand is critical to our efforts to attract new members and increase our revenues 
the number of web sites that offer competing services increases the importance of establishing and maintaining brand recognition 
many of these web sites already have well established brands in online services or the travel industry generally 
promotion of the travelocity brand will depend largely on our success in providing a high quality online experience supported by a high level of customer service 
in addition  we intend to increase our spending substantially on marketing and advertising with the intention of expanding our brand recognition to attract and retain online consumers and to respond to competitive pressures 
however  we cannot provide assurance that these expenditures will be effective to promote our brand or that our marketing efforts generally will achieve our goals 
our inability to effectively promote our brand could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if the company is successful in promoting its brand  the increased brand recognition may not economically justify the cost of brand promotion needed to achieve that recognition 
the success of our business is dependent on the continued use and growth of the internet and the extent of acceptance and profitability of online commerce 
our future revenues and profits depend upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet and online services as a medium for commerce 
rapid growth in the use of the internet and online services is a recent phenomenon 
this growth may not continue 
a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not accept  or continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
demand for and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services over the internet involve a high level of uncertainty 
if the growth of the internet does not continue or if consumers cease to accept the internet as a medium of commerce  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
this will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity and security and the timely development of complementary products for providing reliable internet access and services 
major online service providers and the internet itself have experienced outages and other delays as a result of software and hardware failures and could face such outages and delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to adversely affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on our web sites 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability because of delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity or increased government regulation 
the adoption of new standards or government regulation may require us to incur substantial compliance costs 
such costs may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
declines or disruptions in the travel industry could reduce our revenues 
our business and operations rely on the health and growth of the travel industry 
travel is highly sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels  and thus tends to decline during general economic downturns 
our sales and revenues would be significantly reduced as a result of a decline in travel by consumers 
events that tend to reduce travel would reduce our sales and revenues  including o price escalation in the airline industry or other travel related industries  o airline or other travel related strikes  o political instability and hostilities  o regional hostilities and terrorism  o unusual periods of bad weather  o fuel price escalation  o increased occurrence of travel related accidents  and o economic downturns and recessions 
rapid technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our services to customers 
in order to remain competitive in the online travel industry  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our web sites 
if we fail to continually improve our web sites speed  personalization and customer service  we could lag behind competitors or our web sites could become obsolete 
as a result  we could lose market share and our revenues would decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our services depend on complex search mechanisms to find the best available fares 
if our competitors develop technology to help consumers find the best fares more quickly or easily  or at a cheaper cost  then we may also lose market share 
in order remain competitive  we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses to respond to the increasingly sophisticated requirements of online consumers and suppliers 
such costs and expenses may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
security breaches in our systems or credit card fraud could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
consumer concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet and over privacy issues may inhibit the growth of the internet and online commerce 
the security of our customers confidential transaction data could be jeopardized as a result of the accidental or intentional acts of internet users  our current and former employees or others  or computer viruses 
if we experience credit card fraud or if there is a breach in the security of our systems  we could lose consumers confidence and consequently  their business 
in addition  we may be liable for damages caused by security breaches 
such liability could increase our expenses and exhaust our resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
security breaches experienced by other electronic commerce companies could reduce consumers confidence in our web sites 
although we plan to continue to use encryption and authentication technology  these measures can be circumvented 
the costs required to continually upgrade our security measures could be prohibitively expensive and could result in delays or interruption of service that could result in a loss of consumers 
our computer systems may suffer system failures  capacity constraints and business interruptions which could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose customers 
the interruption  impaired performance or insufficient capacity of our systems could lead to interruptions or delays in our service  loss of data or our inability to process reservations  which could cause us to lose customers 
our systems and operations can be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  viruses  earthquake  tornado and similar events and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans may not be adequate 
if any of such events occur  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continually devote substantial financial  technical and operational resources to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and we cannot accurately predict when we will operate profitably 
we anticipate that the company will incur future losses 
the company incurred net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we develop and expand our services  expand our domestic and international operations  enhance the travelocity brand  fund site and content development and invest in operating infrastructure 
we will need to grow our revenues significantly in order to become and stay profitable 
if our revenues do not grow as expected to defray the estimated costs and expenses  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price could fluctuate significantly 
we are an internet related company engaged in electronic commerce 
market prices for stocks of this type have been volatile and as a result  the market price of our common stock could experience extreme price fluctuations 
if revenues or earnings are less than expected for any quarter  the market price of our common stock could significantly decline  even if the decline in our revenues or earnings is not reflective of any long term problems with our business  financial condition and operating results 
the market price of our common stock could also fluctuate significantly as a result of sales or distributions by our investors who own a substantial number of shares of our common stock 
evolving government regulation could impose taxes or other burdens on our business which could increase our costs or decrease demand for our products 
increased regulation of the internet or different applications of existing laws might slow the growth of the use of the internet and commercial online services  which could decrease demand for our services  increase the cost of doing business or otherwise reduce our sales and revenues 
federal legislation imposing limitations on the ability of states to tax internet based sales was enacted in the internet tax freedom act exempts specific types of sales transactions conducted over the internet from multiple or discriminatory state and local taxation through october  if this legislation is not renewed when it terminates  state and local governments could impose taxes on internet based sales 
these taxes could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our costs of operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
data collection  protection and privacy issues are a growing concern in the u 
s  and many countries around the world in which company does business or may do business in the future 
evolving government regulation in these areas could limit or restrict company s ability to market its products and services to consumers  increase company s costs of operation and lead to a decrease in demand for our products and services  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our continued success depends on the continuing efforts of a few individuals and our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
the loss of the services of terrell b 
jones  our president and chief executive officer  could harm our ability to execute our business strategy and expand our operations 
mr 
jones may not be able to fulfill his responsibilities adequately or he may choose to leave us 
our success also depends on our ability to hire  train  retain and manage highly skilled employees 
there is a significant shortage of  and intense competition for  personnel who are technically skilled 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees or that we will successfully train and manage the employees we hire 
our ability to promote our services in southeast asia  australia  new zealand  japan  india and other nearby regions is restricted 
an agreement between sabre and abacus international pte ltd  the operator of a global distribution system  may restrict us from directing promotions of our services specifically to consumers in southeast asia  australia  new zealand  japan  india and other nearby regions 
the agreement also provides abacus the first opportunity to market our underlying technology to internet service providers in the restricted area 
in addition  after we become profitable  we will be required to transfer a proportional amount of revenues based upon the percentage of bookings made in the restricted marketing area to a joint venture between sabre and abacus 
we will be able to deduct all direct and indirect costs from bookings made from the restricted area 
these restrictions may in the future limit us from expanding our operations in southeast asia  australia  new zealand  japan  india and other nearby regions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk effective with the merger on march   we began maintaining our own cash balances 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the company maintains an investment policy intended to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities such as debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  as well as money market funds 
investments include only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
at december   our combined short term and long term investments in marketable securities were million 
if interest rates were to decline an average of in compared to  our total return on these investments would decrease approximately  these amounts were determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to the company s marketable securities balance as of december
