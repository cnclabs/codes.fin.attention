item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we employ a sales staff as well as outside sales representative organizations to market our andrea anti noise products  our andrea dsp microphone and software products and our aircraft communications products 
andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are marketed to computer oems and related peripheral devices  distributors of personal computers and telecommunications equipment  software publishers  computer and consumer electronic retailers  and end users in both business and household environments 
these products are sold to end users through distributors and value added resellers  software publishers  internet service providers  internet content developers  and retailers 
under our existing collaborative agreements  our collaborators have various marketing and sales rights to our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we are seeking to enter additional collaborative arrangements for marketing and selling our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products  but we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts 
market acceptance of the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products is critical to our success 
we market our aircraft communications products to oems  military organizations  and industrial customers 
production operations we conduct assembly operations at our new york facility and through subcontractors 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise products  we assemble the products at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular andrea anti noise product increase  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components for the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain specialized components  such as microphones and dsp boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
to date we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  but we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products 
we assemble our aircraft communications products at our new york facility from purchased components 
certain highly specialized components for our aircraft communications products sold for military and industrial use have limited sources of supply  the availability of which can affect particular products 
we do not believe  however  that our earnings have been  or will be  materially affected due to unavailability of these components 
competition the markets for our andrea anti noise products  andrea dsp microphone and software products and aircraft communications products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
our andrea anti noise products compete primarily with products from plantronics inc  labtec inc 
and emkay innovative products inc 
most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than us 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
we cannot assure that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  we have incurred significant price pressure  as well as  more recently  a decline in unit sales of andrea anti noise products to our oem customer base shipping continuous speech dictation products 
in the markets for our aircraft communications products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying to specific military initiatives 
our performance in these markets is further subject to several factors  including dependence on government appropriations  the time required for design and development  the complexity of product design  the rapidity with which product designs and technology become obsolete  the intense competition for available business  and the acceptability of manufacturing contracts by government inspectors 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies  and manufacture  assemble and market products  either alone or through third parties  in a profitable manner 
employees at december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in production and related operations  were engaged in research and development  and were engaged in management  administration  sales and customer support duties 
none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees 
during the first quarter of  we undertook steps to reduce the number of our employees 
for more information about this reduction  please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item properties andrea s corporate headquarters is located in melville  new york 
our corporate headquarters is located in approximately  square feet of leased space which houses our production operations  research and development activities  sales  administration and executive offices 
we also lease facilities in utah and israel dedicated for research and development  and in hong kong for production management and limited research and development activities 
we believe that we maintain our machinery  equipment and tooling in good operating condition and that these assets are adequate for our current business and adequately insured 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our property and equipment and leased facilities 
item legal proceedings on november  a complaint was filed against us in the us district court for the eastern district of new york by nct group  inc nct  formerly noise cancellation technologies  inc and nct hearing products  inc  one of nct s subsidiaries 
the complaint involves two of andrea s patents  us patent no 
 and us patent no 
 these patents relate to certain active noise reduction technology that is particularly applicable to aircraft passenger headphones 
andrea does not currently derive any sales or licensing revenue from aircraft passenger headphones 
the complaint requests a declaration that these two patents are invalid and unenforceable and that nct s products do not infringe upon these two patents 
the complaint alleges that andrea has engaged in unfair competition by misrepresenting the scope of the two patents  tortuously interfering with prospective contractual rights between nct and its existing and potential customers  making false and disparaging statements about nct and its products  and falsely advertising andrea s anr products 
the complaint seeks to enjoin andrea from engaging in these alleged activities and seeks compensatory damages of not less than million  punitive damages of not less than million and plaintiffs costs and attorneys fees 
on december   we filed and served an answer to the nct complaint  denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
our counterclaims allege that nct has infringed us patents nos 
 and  and that nct has engaged in trademark infringement  false designation of origin  and unfair competition 
the counterclaims also allege that nct s patent infringement has been and is willful 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief with respect to the allegations of patent infringement  trademark infringement  false designation of origin and unfair competition 
we are also seeking exemplary and punitive damages  prejudgment interest on all damages  costs  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
during the second half of  both nct and andrea submitted briefs to the court on whether to have an early hearing on the meaning of the claims in the two andrea patents 
this type of hearing is called a markman hearing 
we are unable to anticipate when the court will issue a decision on this question 
we and nct are proceeding with discovery  including document production and depositions 
if this suit is ultimately resolved in favor of nct  we could be materially adversely effected 
we believe  however  that nct s allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend andrea and to assert against nct the claims described above 
on march   we were notified about a claim filed with the new york state environmental protection and spill compensation fund the fund by the owners mark j 
mergler and ann mergler  the claimants of property adjoining our former long island city facility 
this claim alleges property damages arising from petroleum migrating from our former facility and was purportedly detected in the basement of the claimants property 
in their claim to the fund  the claimants alleged that their property has been damaged and that they have incurred remedial costs 
in the event the fund honors this claim in whole or in part  we may be liable to reimburse the fund 
the new york state department of environmental conservation has asserted a demand that we investigate and remediate the discharge of petroleum from a fuel oil storage tank at our former long island city facility  and determine whether the petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimants adjoining property 
we engaged environmental consultants to investigate the discharge from the fuel oil storage tank and we are currently funding remediation work 
we denied  however  the allegations that any petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimant s property and objected to the claim made by the claimant to the fund 
on september   a civil action related to this matter was commenced in the nassau county supreme court by mark j 
mergler and ann mergler 
the plaintiffs allege that the fuel oil released from the heating system of our former facility has migrated beneath and onto the neighboring property causing an excess of  in direct and consequential damages 
the plaintiffs allegations against us include  negligence  nuisance and strict liability under the new york state navigation law 
we have submitted an answer denying the allegations and all liability relating to the alleged property damage 
this lawsuit is at an early stage and we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
in addition to the litigation described above  we are from time to time subject to routine litigation incidental to our business

examples of the applications and interfaces for which andrea anti noise r products and andrea dsp microphone and software products provide benefits include internet and other computer based speech  telephony communications  multi point conferencing  speech recognition  multimedia  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  military and commercial aircraft communications  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
we believe that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly in noisy environments  for use with personal computers  mobile personal computing devises  military and commercial aircraft systems  cellular and other wireless communication devices and automotive communication systems 
our andrea dsp microphone and software products use far field digital signal processing technology to provide high quality transmission of voice where the user is at a distance from the microphone 
high quality audio communication technologies will be required for emerging far field voice applications  ranging from continuous speech dictation  to internet telephony and multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration  to natural language driven interfaces for automobiles  home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years 
in order to complement our internal efforts to develop digital signal processing technology  in may  we acquired lamar signal processing  ltd  an israeli corporation engaged in the development of dsp noise cancellation microphone solutions for voice driven interfaces covering a wide range of audio and acoustic applications 
this acquisition resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of the goodwill and other intangible assets has a significant  negative  non cash impact on our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we outsource the assembly of most of our andrea anti noise r products from purchased components  and we are currently assembling our andrea dsp microphone and software products from purchased components at our new york and israeli facilities 
we manufacture our aircraft communications products at our new york facility 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  and other items set forth in this report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  seeks  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management 
investors are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including economic  competitive  governmental  technological and other factors that may affect our business and prospects 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
in order to obtain the benefits of these safe harbor provisions for any such forward looking statements  we wish to caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors  which  among others  have in some cases affected our actual results and are in the future likely to affect our actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include because our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations 
the causes of these fluctuations include  among other things the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements  the cost of development of our products under our collaborative development arrangements  the mix of products we sell  the mix of distribution channels we use  the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors  fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace  and general economic conditions 
our revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately million versus a net loss of million for the year ended december  we continue to experience significant price pressure on our andrea anti noise products  and more recently  we have experienced a decline in unit sales of these products to those of our customers who bundle them with their continuous speech dictation products 
in response  we are examining opportunities for cost reduction  production efficiencies and further diversification of our business 
but to remain competitive  we intend to continue incurring substantial research and development  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
we may not be able to easily and quickly reduce these expenses if our sales revenue falls below our expectations and  therefore  our net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by any reduction in sales revenue 
furthermore  our acquisition in of lamar signal processing  ltd 
resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of these intangible assets has had  and will continue to have  a negative  non cash impact on our results of operations 
as a result of these factors  we expect to continue to accumulate losses and the market price of our common stock could decline 
if we fail to obtain additional capital  we may be required to significantly reduce  or refocus  our operations and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely effected 
from time to time during the past several years  we have raised additional capital from external sources 
we expect to continue to have to raise additional capital from external sources 
these sources may include private or public financings through the issuance of debt  convertible debt or equity  or collaborative arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
additionally  we may only be able to obtain funds through arrangements that require us to relinquish rights to our products  technologies or potential markets 
shares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price  you may experience substantial dilution sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock 
of the  shares of common stock presently authorized   were outstanding as of march  this does not include  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding awards granted under our performance equity plan and stock plan and shares of our common stock reserved for further awards under the stock plan and  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock and exercise of related warrants 
in addition  in may  we issued  shares of common stock as part of the consideration for our acquisition of lamar signal processing  ltd 
trading restrictions on  of these  shares have expired  and trading restrictions on the remaining  shares expire on may  as these trading restrictions expire  these shares are subject to demand and piggyback registration rights 
to date   of the  shares have been registered for sale under the securities act of conversions of our series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock may result in substantial dilution to other holders of our common stock 
currently  we have shares of series b convertible preferred stock and shares of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
both the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock  subject to ownership limitations that prohibit the holders of the preferred stock from owning more than of the outstanding shares of common stock at the time of conversion or over any sixty day period 
these restrictions do not prevent purchasers from converting and selling some of their holdings and then later converting the rest of their holdings 
as the price of our common stock decreases  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock increases 
the variable conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock and any reset of the conversion price of the series c convertible preferred stock are functions of the market price of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock decreases over time  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each series will increase 
the following table illustrates the varying amounts of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of series b convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that the additional amount is paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding conversion price issuable upon conversion common stock the series b holder is prohibited from converting its holdings of the series b convertible preferred stock if after giving effect to such conversion it would beneficially own in excess of or  over any sixty day period  of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such conversion and  in the event that  on a cumulative basis  the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock would exceed of our common stock outstanding on june   approval of our shareholders would be required 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  the following table illustrates  as of any reset date and assuming the conversion price indicated is lower than the then applicable conversion price on that date  the varying amounts of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that the additional amount is paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding conversion price issuable upon conversion common stock the series c holder is prohibited from converting its holdings of the series c convertible preferred stock if after giving effect to such conversion it would beneficially own in excess of or  over any sixty day period  of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such conversion and  in the event that  on a cumulative basis  the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series c convertible preferred stock would exceed of our common stock outstanding on october   approval of our shareholders would be required 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  the following table illustrates the varying amounts of shares of common stock that would be issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock and all outstanding shares of series c convertible preferred stock at the indicated conversion prices without regard to any limitations on conversion and assuming that all additional amounts are paid in cash number of shares of common stock percentage of outstanding conversion price issuable upon conversion common stock the calculation assumes that the conversion price of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock are equal 
this could occur at any reset date on which the conversion price for the series c convertible preferred stock is adjusted down to the series b convertible preferred stock conversion price 
the conversion price of the series b convertible preferred stock would be the prevailing market price 
the series b and series c holder is prohibited from converting the series c or series b convertible preferred stock  or from exercising the warrants issued in connection with the series b convertible preferred stock  in some circumstances 
based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  sales of an increased number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock resulting from a declining market price for our common stock can cause the market price of our common stock to decline further 
disregarding the manner in which the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock are sold as well as any other factors such as reactions to our operating results and general market conditions which may be operative in the market as such time  an increase in the number of shares of common stock eligible for sale can cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
this decrease could reduce the conversion prices of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock  leading to a further increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon future conversions and a further decline in our stock price 
if we are unable to obtain shareholder approval for issuances of common stock upon conversions of our series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock that exceed of our outstanding common stock  we may have to pay substantial penalties 
because there is no floor on the conversion prices of the series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock  we may ultimately be required to issue an amount of common stock exceeding of our outstanding common stock upon conversion of the series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock 
we cannot  however  issue shares of common stock that would exceed of our outstanding common stock unless we obtain the approval of our shareholders 
if we are required to obtain this approval of our shareholders and we are unable to do so  we will be forced to pay the holder of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock substantial penalties until we obtain this approval 
in addition  if shareholder approval is not obtained by a required date  then the holder of the series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock may force us to redeem all or a portion of the preferred shares the test for each of the series b convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock is calculated based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of such issuances 
short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany conversions of series b convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock  which sales may cause downward pressure upon the price of our common stock short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany the sale of converted common stock  which in the aggregate could cause downward pressure upon the price of the common stock  regardless of our operating results  thereby attracting additional short sales of the common stock 
the result of conversions of the series b and series c convertible preferred stock at declining conversion prices would be increasing and substantial dilution of the interests of the other holders of common stock 
if we fail to market and commercialize our andrea anti noise and andrea digital signal processing microphone and software products  our revenues may not increase at a high enough rate to improve our results of operations or at all 
our business  results of operations and financial condition depend on successful commercialization of our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products and technologies 
since we began sales of the initial andrea anti noise products in  we have been expanding the number of products in this line 
we introduced our first andrea digital super directional array products in and we are initially targeting these and our other andrea dsp microphone and software products at the market for computer based automobile monitoring and control systems for use by drivers and passengers 
this market is commonly referred to as the automobile telematics market 
the success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization  particularly companies in the computing and communications industries 
if we are unable to obtain market acceptance of our voice interface and internet communications products and technologies or if market acceptance of these products and technologies occurs at a slow rate  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we and our competitors are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice  particularly in noisy environments  for a broad range of computer and communications applications 
these products and technologies have been rapidly evolving and the number of our competitors has grown  but the markets for these products and technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty and have been developing slowly 
we  alone or together with our industry  may be unsuccessful in obtaining market acceptance of these products and technologies 
if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies in response to competition and evolving technology  we may not be able to attract new customers or retain current customers 
the markets in which we sell our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and software products and our traditional line of military and industrial products are highly competitive 
we may not compete successfully with any of our competitors 
most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technology development  marketing  technical support and other resources than we do 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
one or more of these competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products 
we are currently engaged in the development of digital signal processing products and technologies for the voice  speech and natural language interface markets 
we may not succeed in developing these new digital signal processing products and technologies  and any of these new digital signal processing products or technologies may not gain market acceptance 
in the markets for our traditional products  we often compete with major defense electronics corporations as well as smaller manufacturing firms which specialize in supplying products and technologies for specific military initiatives 
further  the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies 
we may not successfully anticipate and adapt our products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards or to introductions of new products and technologies by others that render our then existing products and technologies obsolete 
if our marketing collaborators do not effectively market those of their products with which our products are included or incorporated  our sales growth could be adversely affected 
we have entered into several collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products through inclusion or incorporation with the products of our collaborators 
our success will therefore be dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators to market those of their products with which our products are included or incorporated 
our collaborators may not successfully market these products 
in addition  our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies  and we have no control over their marketing efforts 
furthermore  our collaborators may develop their own microphone  earphone or headset products that may replace our products or technologies or to which they may give higher priority 
we have also established direct marketing arrangements with large electronic and computer retail chains in the united states  as well as with distributors in europe and the americas 
these channels may not devote sufficient resources to support the sale of our products 
if we fail to maintain sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and software products to ibm  we would experience a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are substantially dependent on our product procurement relationship with ibm 
during the years ended december   and  ibm and several of ibm s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for  and  respectively  of our net sales 
ibm is not obligated to purchase these products and is free to purchase microphone and earphone products and technologies from our competitors 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of more specialized components for our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone products could have a material adverse effect on our sales of these products 
we conduct assembly operations at our facilities in new york and israel and through subcontractors using purchased components 
some specialized components for the andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products  such as microphones and digital signal processing boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
we may not be able to continue to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  particularly if our sales of andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products increase substantially or market demand for these components otherwise increases 
if our subcontractor fails to meet our production and shipment schedules  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we conduct assembly operations at our facilities in new york and israel and through subcontracting 
during initial production runs of andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone products  we perform assembly operations at our new york facility from purchased components 
as sales of any particular product increase  assembly operations are primarily transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
our ability to compete may be limited by our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or by patents granted to third parties 
we rely on a combination of patents  patent applications  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  nondisclosure agreements with our employees  licensees and potential licensees  limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information  and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
however  the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent its misappropriation or circumvention 
in addition  numerous patents have been granted to other parties in the fields of noise cancellation  noise reduction  computer voice recognition  digital signal processing and related subject matter 
we expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap 
claims of this type could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products or to develop new products and technologies  because the parties holding these patents may refuse to grant licenses or only grant licenses with onerous royalty requirements 
moreover  the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
an unfavorable ruling in any current litigation proceeding or future proceeding may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time we are subject to litigation incidental to our business 
for example  we are subject to the risk of adverse claims  interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  oppositions to patent applications outside the united states  and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation to establish the validity of patents  to assert infringement claims against others  and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is in our favor 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings of this annual report  on november  a complaint was filed against us in the us district court for the eastern district of new york by nct group  inc and nct hearing products  inc  one of nct s subsidiaries  requesting a declaration that two of our patents  which relate to active noise reduction technology applicable to aircraft passenger headphones  are invalid and unenforceable and that these patents are not being infringed by nct s products 
the complaint also seeks to enjoin us from engaging in certain alleged activities and seeks compensatory damages of not less than million  punitive damages of not less than million and plaintiffs costs and attorneys fees 
on december   we filed and served an answer to the nct complaint  denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief for patent infringement  trademark infringement  false designation of origin and unfair competition 
we are also seeking exemplary and punitive damages  prejudgment interest on all damages  costs  reasonable attorneys fees and expenses 
during the second half of  both nct and andrea submitted briefs to the court on whether to have an early hearing on the meaning of the claims in the two andrea patents 
this type of hearing is called a markman hearing 
we are unable to anticipate when the court will issue a decision on this question 
we and nct are proceeding with discovery  including document production and depositions 
if this suit is ultimately resolved in favor of nct  we could be materially adversely effected 
we believe  however  that nct s allegations are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and to assert against nct the claims described above 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings of this annual report  on march   we were notified about a claim filed with the new york state environmental protection and spill compensation fund by the owners mark j 
mergler and ann mergler of property adjoining our former long island city facility 
this claim alleges property damages arising from petroleum migrating from our former facility and was purportedly detected in the basement of the claimants property 
in their claim to the fund  the claimants alleged that their property has been damaged and that they have incurred remedial costs 
in the event the fund honors this claim in whole or in part  we may be liable to reimburse the fund 
the new york state department of environmental conservation has asserted a demand that we investigate and remediate the discharge of petroleum from a fuel oil storage tank at our former long island city facility  and determine whether the petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimants adjoining property 
we engaged environmental consultants to investigate the discharge from the fuel oil storage tank and we are currently funding remediation work 
we denied  however  the allegations that any petroleum discharge has migrated to the claimant s property and objected to the claim made by the claimant to the fund 
on september   a civil action related to this matter was commenced in the nassau county supreme court by mark j

the plaintiffs allege that the fuel oil released from the heating system of our former facility has migrated beneath and onto the neighboring property causing in excess of  in direct and consequential damages 
the plaintiffs allegations against us include  negligence  nuisance and strict liability under the new york state navigation law 
we have submitted an answer denying the allegations and all liability relating to the alleged property damage 
this lawsuit is at an early stage and we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
changes in economic and political conditions outside the united states could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have been seeking to increase our sales to regions outside the united states  particularly in europe and areas in the americas and asia 
for the year ended december   sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net sales 
international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including o trade restrictions in the form of license requirements  o restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls  o changes in tariffs and taxes  o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  o problems in establishing and managing distributor relationships  o general economic conditions  and o political and economic instability or conflict 
to date  we have invoiced our international sales in us dollars  and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
we may not continue to be able to invoice all our sales in us dollars and to avoid engaging in foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
if we are required to invoice any material amount of international sales in non us currencies  fluctuations in the value of non us currencies relative to the non us dollar may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations 
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and other personnel necessary for our business  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of these executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified managers and technical personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease in sales for the year ended december  reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales and an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales  both offset by initial sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products of  or of total sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during were a significant decline in headset unit shipments to ibm and  to a lesser extent  continued price pressures from ibm 
in addition  the decrease from reflects a decline in aircraft communication product sales as a result of a product transformation required to meet future demand for printed circuit and digital based intercom systems 
initial sales of andrea dsp microphone and software products were primarily comprised of shipments of andrea s far field microphone products for use with business videoconferencing systems  professional audio microphones and desktop speech dictation applications 
for the year ended december   sales of our computer headsets to one customer and certain of that customer s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for approximately of our total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily a result of lower than expected andrea anti noise and aircraft communications production and sales described above under sales over which to spread the company s pool of fixed overhead costs 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  this increase is due to the company s continuing efforts to develop its digital signal processing microphone and software technologies  coupled with  to a lesser extent  efforts in aircraft communication technologies 
research and development in dsp based technology at the company is focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating the company s array microphone technologies obtained through the acquisition of lamar signal processing  ltd 
lamar in may correspondingly  the activities of lamar accounted for approximately of the total research and development expenses during the company believes that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces its position in digital signal processing by extending the company s marketing programs to other high growth industries  including automotive telematics  mobile device markets  the business videoconferencing market and internet telephony  among others 
specifically  the core technology acquired produces noise filtering capabilities that management believes is superior to other known dsp based technologies in the marketplace  and is unattainable in products using traditional mechanical solutions 
in addition  the nature of a dsp based solution  together with the people acquired supporting our technology  offers a solution that is highly scalable and embeddable  and therefore enables the technology to be integrated into many different applications and form factors 
we believe that continued research and development spending will provide the company with a significant competitive advantage 
for  we expect total research and development spending to approach levels similar to that of general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses increased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the slight increase was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses during the second half of the year associated with sales efforts in the automotive telematics market  as well as increases in overall sales and marketing salaries 
the company implemented a cost reduction plan aimed at cutting costs that are not integral to the execution of the company s overall strategy  and to ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
included in the company s cost reduction initiatives was a reduction in workforce which was implemented during february of  representing a reduction of approximately of the company s then total workforce 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  the increase is due to interest earned on higher cash balances throughout  coupled with other miscellaneous income generated during provision for income taxes the company did not record income tax expense for the year ending december  in light of the net loss recorded for the period 
furthermore  the realization of a portion of the company s reserved deferred tax assets  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
the company will be continually re assessing its reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis 
the determination as to the realization of additional reserves is  and will be  based on andrea s expectations of future earnings 
to the extent andrea s management believes that  more likely than not  previously reserved deferred tax assets will be realized  andrea will reduce the reserve accordingly

year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales sales for the year ended december  were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  the decrease in sales for the year ended december  reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales  and an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales 
the primary reasons for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during were the lower volumes and lower price lower margin sales of pc headsets to the company s original equipment manufacture oem customers 
for the year ended december   sales of our computer headsets to one customer and certain of that customer s affiliates  distributors  licensees and integrators accounted for approximately of our total sales 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of sales percentage is primarily a result of the shift in product mix described above under sales 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  this increase is due to the company s continuing efforts to develop its digital signal processing microphone and software technologies  coupled with  to a lesser extent  efforts in computer telephony headset technologies 
the activities of lamar accounted for approximately of the total research and development expenses during general  administrative and selling expenses general  administrative and selling expenses decreased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  excluding the effect of a full year of goodwill amortization expense associated with the acquisition of lamar in may of  during the year ended december   general  administrative and selling expenses decreased approximately from the same period in the decreases are primarily attributable to cost reduction efforts and a reallocation of resources to research and development activities 
other income expense other expense for the year ended december  was  compared to other income of  for the year ended december  this change is primarily attributable to the net gain on the sale of the company s then corporate headquarters in long island city during the year ended december  of  provision for income taxes the company did not record income tax expense for the year ending december  in light of the net loss recorded for the period 
net income loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  gross cash inflows from operations and proceeds from the sale of convertible notes and redeemable convertible preferred stock to certain financial institutions 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december  is primarily a result of the company s issuance and sale in a private placement of  of its series c redeemable convertible preferred stock on october  the series c preferred stock 
the company is using the net proceeds from the issuance of the series c preferred stock primarily for costs associated with research and development  creating and maintaining strategic alliances  which includes  among other things  sales and marketing salaries  substantial travel costs to market our products and technologies  product fulfillment costs and technical assistance  and other general support costs for existing and potential partners  payment of certain debt obligations  professional fees  and general working capital requirements 
in connection with the acquisition of lamar  of the aggregate cash consideration to be paid by the company   was paid on may   the closing date  and  was paid on each of the six  twelve and twenty four month anniversaries of the closing date  with the remainder payable on the thirty six month anniversary of the closing 
the approximate  in additional cash consideration remaining  due on the thirty six month anniversary of the closing  is recorded as current portion of long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital reflects a decrease in total current liabilities of  partially offset by a decrease in total current assets of  the decrease in current liabilities primarily reflects a  decrease in convertible notes representing the payment of the remaining obligation of convertible notes issued in june  offset by a  increase in other current liabilities 
the decrease in total current assets primarily reflects a decrease in inventory of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of the decrease in cash of  reflects  of net cash used in operating activities   of net cash used in investing activities and  of net cash provided by financing activities 
the cash used in operating activities  excluding non cash charges  is primarily attributable to the  net loss for the year ended december   a  increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in other assets  a  increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a  decrease in other current liabilities  partially offset by a  decrease in inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the level of the third and fourth quarter sales  coupled with timing of sales collection 
generally  the company collects receivables from sales within two months 
the increase in other assets primarily reflects increases in patent and trademark costs associated with the company s proprietary technologies 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  the decrease in other current liabilities  as well as the decrease in inventory  primarily reflect differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of raw materials as well as for other services in connection with ongoing efforts related to the andrea anti noise and aircraft communication products lines 
the cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to investments in the company s existing information systems  as well as  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures consisting of the ongoing upgrade and purchases of manufacturing dies and molds for the company s product lines 
the net cash provided by financing activities reflects the issuance and sale of the series c preferred stock and the exercises of employee stock options  offset by the payment of the remaining principal amount of the notes and the twenty four month anniversary installment payment to the former shareholders of lamar 
demand for the company s products and technologies has required the company to raise additional working capital to support operations 
in addition  the acquisition of lamar will require the company to continue to provide working capital to support lamar s operations and to repay notes to the sellers of lamar 
in december  april  august and june  the company raised working capital through the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
in june  the company raised million through the issuance and sale of series b preferred stock 
in october  the company raised million through the issuance and sale of series c preferred stock 
we believe that our current levels of cash  anticipated gross cash flows from operations  as well as our access to financing sources  provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund working capital requirements for at least twelve to eighteen months 
notwithstanding the significance of sales of andrea anti noise products as a percentage of our total sales during  we cannot assure that demand will continue for these products or any of our other products  including future products related to our andrea digital signal processing microphone and software technologies  or  that if such demand does exist  that we will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms  or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal source of financing is the issuance of convertible debt with financial institutions 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through any amounts payable in stock  or cash by us under convertible securities 
a significant rise in interest rates could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
in addition  substantially all transactions by us are denominated in us dollars 
as such  we have shifted foreign currency exposure onto our foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  we could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations
