item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and background the company s sales and net earnings increased significantly through primarily as a result of its acquisitions 
following each acquisition  the company implemented programs to take advantage of distribution and operating synergies among its businesses 
this implementation was reflected in increases in the company s sales and in the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of the company s sales 
however  beginning with the last quarter of and through the company experienced a decline in demand for its commodity related products fixed resistors  multi layer ceramic chip capacitors and tantalum capacitors which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues during that time 
such decline in demand resulted in a decrease in revenues  earnings and backlogs of these products 
in order to address the slowdown in demand and price erosion resulting from an oversupply of tantalum and multi layer ceramic chip capacitors  the company implemented a restructuring program beginning in that included the downsizing and closing of manufacturing facilities in north america and europe 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred  of pretax charges for the year ended december  relating to employee termination and facility closure costs 
in the company incurred  of restructuring expenses relating to employee termination and facility closure costs in europe 
in the company incurred  of restructuring expenses 
in the late s  the company began to enter into the active components business 
in july  the company purchased a interest in lpsc  a taiwan based company that is a major supplier of discrete active electronic components in asia 
in july  the company sold its interest in lpsc to the lite on group  the owner of the remaining interest in lpsc  for consideration consisting of cash and the assignment or transfer to vishay of the lite on group s rights under stock appreciation rights 
in  the company acquired the semiconductor business group of temic  which included telefunken and of siliconix  producers of transistors  diodes  optoelectronics  and power and analog switching integrated circuits 
in february  the company communicated a proposal to the board of directors of siliconix to purchase any and all outstanding shares of siliconix not already owned by vishay 
this proposal is currently being evaluated by a special committee of directors of siliconix appointed in march from the third quarter of through the third quarter of  the company experienced increased demand for its products  including both passive and active electronic components  as a result of growth in the wireless telecommunications market  particularly cell phones  and the increased use of embedded computing devices in a wide range of consumer and commercial products 
the company expanded capacity in all of its major product lines in order to satisfy the increased demand  and  in some cases  was able to increase pricing for its products because of tight supply  reversing the price erosion experienced in prior years 
however  as a result of a recent slowing of growth in the personal computer and cell phone product markets  the company has recently experienced softness in product demand  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals 
this decrease in demand could cause a significant drop in average sales prices  which could  in turn  cause a reduction in the company s gross margins and operating profits 
the company s strategy contemplates transferring some of its manufacturing operations from countries with high labor costs and tax rates  such as the united states  france and germany  to israel  mexico  portugal  the czech republic  taiwan and the people s republic of china in order to benefit from lower labor costs and  in the case of israel  to take advantage of various government incentives  including government grants and tax incentives 
the company intends to continue to explore and implement opportunities for cost efficiencies in its manufacturing operations 
the company realizes approximately of its revenues from customers outside the united states 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can significantly affect the company s reported sales and  to a lesser extent  earnings 
currency fluctuations impact the company s net sales and other income statement amounts  as denominated in us dollars  including other income as it relates to foreign exchange gains or losses 
generally  in order to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on profits  the company endeavors to minimize the time for settling intercompany transactions 
in connection with its day to day operations  the company generally does not purchase foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures 
in september  a subsidiary of the company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exchange rate exposure on certain foreign currency denominated transactions 
as of december   the company and its subsidiaries did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel as compared to the statutory rate in the united states have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
the more favorable israeli tax rates are applied to specific approved projects and are normally available for a period of ten years or  if the investment in the project is over million  for a period of years  which has been the case for most of the company s projects in israel since new projects are continually being introduced 
in addition  the israeli government offers certain incentive programs in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
however  the israeli government has scaled back or discontinued some of its incentive programs over the past several years 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new incentive programs applicable to the company or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits the company has historically received or that the company will continue to be eligible to take advantage of them 
the company might be materially adversely affected if these incentive programs were no longer available to the company for new projects 
however  because a majority of the company s projects in israel already benefit from government incentive programs  the company does not anticipate that any cutbacks in the incentive programs would have an adverse impact on its earnings and operations for at least several years 
israeli government grants  recorded as a reduction of costs of products sold  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the prior year 
if the israeli government continues its grant and incentive programs  future benefits offered to the company by the israeli government will likely depend on the company s continuing to increase capital investment and the number of company employees in israel

the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company s products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  can be adjusted to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
safe harbor statement from time to time  information provided by the company  including but not limited to statements in this report  or other statements made by or on behalf of the company  may contain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  which may cause actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those anticipated 
set forth below are important factors that could cause the company s results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
changes in product demand  competition  backlog o the company offers a broad variety of products and services to its customers 
changes in demand for or in the mix of  products and services comprising revenues could cause actual operating results to vary from those expected 
due to a recent slowing of growth in the personal computer and cell phone markets  the company and others in the electronic and semi conductor component industry have recently experienced softness in product demand  resulting in order cancellations and deferrals 
this slowdown may continue and may become more pronounced 
such a slowdown in demand  as well as recessionary trends in the global economy in general or in specific countries or regions where the company sells the bulk of its products  such as the us  germany  france or the pacific rim  could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
o the company operates in a highly competitive environment  which includes significant competitive pricing pressures and intense competition for entry into new markets 
the electronics components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years  and the company s major competitors  some of which are larger than the company  have significant financial resources and technological capabilities 
o many of the orders in the company s backlog may be canceled by its customers without penalty 
customers may on occasion double and triple order components from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when backlog is particularly long 
the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted if customers were to cancel a material portion of such orders and this produced a significant decrease in demand for the company s products 
product development  business expansion o the company s future operating results are dependent  in part  on its ability to develop  produce and market new and innovative products  to convert existing products to surface mount devices and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this complex process  including the risks that the company will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that the company will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers changing needs 
o the company s historic growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from its strategy to expand through acquisitions 
however  there is no assurance that the company will find or consummate transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
from time to time  when the company is in the process of pursuing a strategic acquisition  the company or the acquisition target may feel compelled for securities and other legal reasons to announce the potential acquisition or the company s desire to enter into a certain market prior to entering into formal agreements 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will consummate any such acquisition 
o the company was substantially debt free at the end of if the company were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash  the acquisition would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this would decrease the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria 
the company cannot ensure that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to the company when required on acceptable terms 
o the company may have difficulty expanding its manufacturing of product lines to satisfy future increases in demand for its products 
factors that could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel and capacity constraints at the company s facilities 
if the company is unable to meet its customers requirements and its competitors sufficiently expand production  the company could lose customers and or market share 
o any drop in demand or increase in supply of the company s products due to the expansion of production capacity by the company s competitors could cause a dramatic drop in average sales prices causing a drop in gross margins 
foreign operations and sales o approximately of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
as a result  currency exchange rate fluctuations  regional inflation  changes in monetary policy and tariffs  potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the company s business in foreign jurisdictions  international trade restrictions or prohibitions  intergovernmental disputes  increased labor costs and reduction or cancellation of government grants  tax benefits or other incentives could impact the company s results of operations 
o specifically  as a result of the increased production by the company s operations in israel over the past several years  the low tax rates in israel  as compared to the statutory rates in the us  have had the effect of increasing the company s net earnings 
in addition  the company takes advantage of certain incentive programs in israel in the form of grants designed to increase employment in israel 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates or reduction or elimination of any of the israeli grant programs  such as described in description of business manufacturing operations could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
restructuring and cost reduction activities o the company s strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to lower cost regions such as israel  mexico  portugal  the czech republic  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
in this process  the company may experience underutilization of certain plants and factories in high labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in low labor cost regions  resulting initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
such costs include those associated with work force reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  as described in introduction and background of this item  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the start of production in new plants and expansions in lower labor cost regions 
moreover  capacity constraints may limit the company s ability to continue to meet demand for any of the company s products 
for example  during  restructuring costs were particularly high as a result of the company s accelerated effort to streamline operations in response to the continued weakness in the international electronic components market at the time 
o the company has in the past and may in the future respond to changing economic conditions by restructuring its operations 
such restructruing  particularly in europe  may result in labor unrest or strikes  which could have an adverse effect on the company o the company s strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales offices and administrative functions at acquired companies 
the company s inability to achieve these goals could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
raw materials o the company s results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials  supplies  power  natural resources and any other items needed for the production of the company s products  the effects of quality deviations in raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  palladium and ceramic dielectric materials  and the effects of significant price increases for tantalum or palladium  or an inability to obtain adequate supplies of tantalum or palladium from the limited number of suppliers 
prices for tantalum powder are expected to increase significantly in the near future 
the class b common stock o the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held  while the holders of class b common stock are entitled to votes for each share held 
currently  the holders of class b common stock hold of the voting power of the company 
as a result  the holders of class b common stock are able to cause the election of their nominees as directors of the company 
the holders of class b common stock may also be able to approve other action as stockholders without obtaining the votes of other stockholders of the company 
o the effective control of the company by holders of class b common stock may make the company less attractive as a target for a takeover proposal 
it may also render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal or proxy contest for the removal of the incumbent directors  even if such actions were favored by all stockholders of the company other than the holders of the class b common stock 
accordingly  this may deprive the holders of common stock of an opportunity they might otherwise have to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price in connection with a merger or acquisition of the company with or by another company 
miscellaneous factors o the company s results may also be affected by a variety of other factors  including possible environmental liability and remediation costs  legal proceedings and investigations  possible challenges to the company s intellectual property rights  increases in the company s debt levels or its cost of borrowings  changes in generally accepted accounting policies and practices  disruptions to the company s manufacturing operations that may result from casualty losses  military hostilities particularly in the middle east  or acts of god  and changes in executive personnel
