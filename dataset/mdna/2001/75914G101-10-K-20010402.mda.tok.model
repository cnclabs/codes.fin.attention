we are the successor by merger to forman interactive corp 
forman interactive commenced operations in as a developer of electronic commerce software  and began offering web hosting and related products and services in in february  we began to distribute domain names either for free or  to a lesser extent  were paid commissions for the domain names we distributed for international registrars and registries 
in april  we commenced offering registration services for country code domains and in june  we began operating as a paid registrar in the 
com  
net and 
org domains 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of inabox  inc through a merger for approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we use inabox s software to develop our firststepsite product and bestsrs  one of the reseller solutions offered to our global partner network 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  inabox s financial results are consolidated with our financial results from the date of acquisition 
in september  we acquired afternic 
com  inc  a leading secondary market exchange for domain names  for approximately million cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock to the stockholders of afternic 
com  a portion of which cash and stock was used to satisfy existing obligations of afternic 
com 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  afternic 
com s financial results are consolidated with our financial results from the date of acquisition 
through registrypro  a joint venture with the uk based registrar virtual internet plc  we are establishing a registry for the new gtld 
pro  which will be dedicated to certified professionals such as lawyers  doctors and accountants 
we currently own of the equity in registypro 
we also have a small equity stake in afilias  the consortium of registrars  which was selected to manage the registry for the new gtld 
info 
we currently expect each of these new registries to launch in the second half of  although their launch is dependent on finalizing contract negotiations with icann and is not assured 
net revenues we derive our net revenues from domain name registrations  online products and services and advertising 
net revenues from domain name registrations consist of fees paid by registrants over the course of the registration period reduced by referral commissions and a provision for credit card chargebacks 
we currently earn registration fees in connection with new  renewal  extended and transferred registrations 
from june until january   we offered two year registration periods for initial domain name registrations in the 
com  
net and 
org domains with annual renewals and either one or two year registration periods for domain names in the country code domains 
beginning january   we expanded our registration period offerings to include one  five and ten year registration periods for initial domain name registrations in the 
com  
net and 
org domains 
renewal and extension registration periods can be from one to ten years 
our standard pricing for 
com  
net and 
org domain names is currently per year through our www 
register 
com website 
we currently charge approximately to for one or two year country code domain names registered through our www 
register 
com website 
from time to time we run promotional campaigns to acquire additional registrations and customers  including significant free promotions which we ran during the third quarter of we charge the same rates for renewals as we do for corresponding initial registration periods 
because we only began operating as a registrar in april  we have processed a limited number of registration renewals 
we anticipate that registration renewals will contribute to our net revenues as our customers initial registrations reach the end of their terms and a portion of these customers renew their registrations 
in addition to our standard registration fees  we have a number of different fee structures for our domain registration services 
our corporate services division delivers a diversified range of higher priced services for our corporate customers and extends bulk discounts for domain name registrations and transfers 
we pay referral commissions based on a percentage of the net registration revenues derived from registrations processed through the participants in our network of co brand websites and those we process through our www 
register 
com website referred to us by participants in our affiliate network 
participants in our network of private label websites pay us a fee per registration  discounted off of our standard registration fee 
in august  we added product and service offerings to expand into different segments of the domain name registration market which we did not previously serve 
these include registrations targeted for bulk customers and registered through namebargain 
com at a substantial discount to our standard registration fees and the use of domain names for consumers at no charge registered through namedemo 
com limiting the customer to one name per user as identified by a unique email address and are offered for a duration of one year 
each of these new offerings includes a reduced level of customer service and limited value added products or services 
we stopped accepting new registrations through namedemo 
com in february so that we could evaluate its effectiveness as a customer acquisition tool as we continue to encourage our namedemo customers to register their domain names through our www 
register 
com website 
domain name registration revenues are deferred at the time of the registration and are recognized ratably over the term of the registration period 
under this subscription based model  we recognize revenue when we provide the registration services  including customer service and maintenance of the individual domain name records 
we require prepayment via credit card for all online domain name registration sales  which provides us with the full cash fee at the beginning of the registration period while recognizing the revenues over the registration period 
for some of our customers who register domain names through our corporate services department and for some participants in our network of private label websites  we establish lines of credit based on credit worthiness 
online products and services  which primarily consist of email  domain name forwarding  web hosting  site submission to search engines and software  are sold either as annual or monthly subscriptions  depending on the product or service offering 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the period in which we provide our services 
our software revenues consist solely of software sales by our inabox subsidiary 
to date  these software revenues have not been material and we do not expect these revenues to be material for the foreseeable future 
we offer web hosting through our own servers and through web hosting services provided by third parties 
in  we shifted our business model and have chosen to direct our resources toward our domain name registration business and not toward our own web hosting business 
as such  while we continue to offer our own web hosting services  we do not actively promote this service and  therefore  do not anticipate significant revenue growth from our own web hosting service in future periods 
we intend  however  to continue actively promoting web hosting services provided by third parties 
advertising revenues are derived from the sale of sponsorships and banner advertisements under short term contracts that range from one month to one year in duration 
we recognize these revenues ratably over the period in which the advertisements are displayed provided that no significant company obligation remains and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with providing domain name registrations and online products and services 
cost of revenues for domain name registrations primarily consists of registry fees  depreciation on the equipment used to process the domain name registrations  the fees paid to the co location facilities maintaining our equipment and fees paid to the financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
through january   we paid a per year registry fee for each 
com  
net and 
org domain name registration 
this fee was reduced to per year effective january  we currently pay registry fees of approximately to for one or two year country code domain name registrations registered through our www 
register 
com website 
the largest component of our cost of revenues is the registry fees which  while paid in full at the time that the domain name is registered  are recorded as a prepaid expense and recognized ratably over the term of the registration 
cost of revenues for our online products and services consists of fees paid to third party service providers  depreciation on the equipment used to deliver the services  fees paid to the co location facilities maintaining our equipment and fees paid to the financial institutions to process credit card payments on our behalf 
there are no material costs associated with our software revenues 
while we have no direct cost of revenues associated with our advertising revenue  we do incur operational costs including salaries and commissions  which are classified as operating expenses 
we have no incremental cost of revenues associated with advertising since we use the same equipment to deliver the advertisements as we use for our domain name registration services 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  non cash compensation expenses  and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  marketing programs such as advertising  registry fees associated with the domain names registered through namedemo 
com or as part of our promotional campaigns which offered free registrations and  to a lesser extent  commissions paid to our sales representatives 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  fees for outside consultants and related costs associated with the development and integration of new products and services  the enhancement of existing products and services and quality assurance 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation  consist primarily of employee salaries and other personnel related expenses for executive  financial and administrative personnel  as well as professional services fees and bad debt accruals 
non cash compensation expenses are related to grants of stock options and warrants made to employees  directors  consultants and vendors 
facilities expenses are allocated across our different operating expense categories 
in addition to the  million and million of non cash compensation expenses recorded in  and  respectively  we will record approximately million in additional non cash compensation charges through as follows million in each of and   in and  in these charges primarily relate to the issuance of employee stock options having exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant 
under current accounting rules  we will record approximately million of additional amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in connection with our acquisitions of inabox  inc and afternic 
com  inc  through as follows million in each of and  million in and million in the non cash compensation charges and amortization charges will reduce our earnings or increase our losses  as applicable  in future periods 
net income losses we have incurred annual losses from our operations since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had net income of  for the year ended december  although we achieved profitability for the year ended december   this profitability was due  in part  to a one time gain of million from the sale of our investment in a private company and the recognition of interest income 
accordingly  although we were profitable for the year ended december   we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase our profitability in the future 
results of operations because we only began operating as a domain name registrar in the second quarter of and generated only limited revenues from domain name registration services prior to this time  we believe that comparisons of against is not meaningful and you should not rely upon it as an indication of our future performance 
furthermore  given the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history as a competitive registrar  our operating results are difficult to forecast  and period to period comparisons of our prior operating results will not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the nascent state of the domain name registration market  events in the market such as the introduction of new generic top level domains and other factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we anticipate that in future periods  net revenues from domain name registrations will continue to be the largest component of our net revenues  and cost of domain name registrations will continue to be the largest component of our cost of revenues 
years ended december  and net revenues total net revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  domain name registrations 
revenues from domain name registrations increased from million for to million for this increase was primarily due to the shift in our business from serving as a distributor of domain names to serving as a registrar for generic top level domain names in june additionally  we had million of deferred revenue from domain name registrations at december   increasing to million at december in the first quarter of we registered approximately  new domain names in the 
com  
net and 
org and country code domains 
in the second quarter of we registered approximately  new domains names in these domains 
in the third quarter of we registered approximately  new domain names in these domains  including a significant number of free promotions 
in the fourth quarter of we registered approximately  new and transferred domain names in these domains 
our number of paid domain name registrations and  therefore  our cash bookings decreased sequentially each quarter since the first quarter of we believe that the growth rate experienced in the domain name registration market in late and is not an indication of anticipated future growth rates 
during that period substantial numbers of domain name registrations were driven by factors including i the recognition by businesses that they needed to establish an online presence  ii significant registration activity by domain name speculators  who register names with the intention of reselling them rather than putting them to use  and iii extremely strong growth in new business start ups in the internet sector 
in late  the domain name registration market s growth rate began to decrease  however  we expect it to normalize in the future 
looking forward  we believe that the introduction of new gtlds will be an important driver of the future growth of the domain name registration market 
we believe that there is a natural absorption of the new gtlds and that anything in excess of this absorption will be primarily a function of the success of marketing efforts 
consequently  we anticipate that as each new gtld is introduced  there will be an initial spike in new registrations  which will level off over time 
we anticipate that registration renewals will contribute to our revenues from domain name registrations as our customers initial registrations reach the end of their terms and a portion of these customers renew their registrations 
we also believe that a large number of the names registered in and were registered by domain name speculators who register names with the intention of reselling them rather than putting them to use 
as a result  we expect that a significant percentage of the currently existing domain name registrations will not be renewed and will be allowed to lapse 
over time  as the percentage of names held by speculators decreases  we expect to see an increase in the renewal rates across the industry 
taking into account all of these market dynamics  we anticipate that revenues from domain name registrations will continue to increase 
online products and services 
revenues from online products and services increased from million for to million for the increase resulted primarily from increased sales of email and domain name forwarding services 
we anticipate that revenues from online products and services will remain relatively flat in the near term  but that these revenues will increase over the long term as we expand our online product and service offerings 
advertising 
revenues from advertising increased from million for to million for  primarily from the increased number of page views and the volume of advertising and sponsorships sold on our www 
register 
com  firststepsite and futuresite websites 
we anticipate that revenues from advertising in future periods will increase only moderately as we face increasing challenges in the internet advertising market 
we believe that these challenges will be more than offset by the attractiveness of our paying customer base to potential advertisers  as well as the availability of additional advertising space on our afternic 
com  and namebargain 
com websites 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased from million for to million for cost of domain name registrations 
cost of domain name registrations increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year the increase was primarily due to the shift in our business from serving as a distributor of domain names to serving as a registrar for generic top level domain names in june as a distributor  we generally passed through registry costs to the applicable registry or registrar 
we anticipate that cost of revenues for domain name registrations will continue to increase  tracking the growth in our domain name registrations and renewals 
cost of online products and services 
cost of online products and services decreased  from  for to  for due primarily to cost cutbacks and renegotiated contracts with certain vendors 
we anticipate that these costs will increase over the long term as we expand our online products and services offerings 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased from million for to million for sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million for to million for the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with our radio  print media and television advertising campaigns 
the radio and print campaign was launched in september  while the television campaign began in may the increase is also due to i salaries associated with newly hired sales  marketing and customer service professionals and ii the registry fees associated with a registrations effected through namedemo 
com which was launched in august and b free registrations offered through promotional campaigns run principally in september we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in the near term as we continue to expand into new markets  but take a more targeted marketing as opposed to brand building approach and focus our efforts on improving customer retention and lowering acquisition costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million for to million for the increase resulted primarily from salaries associated with new personnel in technology to support our growth

general and administrative expenses  exclusive of non cash compensation  increased from million for to million for the increase was primarily due to salaries associated with newly hired personnel and related costs required to manage our growth and facilities expansion 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as appropriate to support our overall growth 
non cash compensation expenses  included herein  decreased from million for to million for in  the expense was primarily associated with the modification of warrants previously granted to some of our stockholders and the issuance of warrants in connection with a financial consulting agreement  and a minimal portion of the expense was the result of the amortization of deferred compensation related to employee stock options 
in  the non cash compensation expense was primarily attributable to the amortization of deferred compensation related to employee stock options 
based principally on grants of stock options and warrants made to date  we will record approximately million of additional non cash compensation through as follows million in each of and   in and  in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was million for and related to the goodwill and intangibles associated with our acquisitions of inabox and afternic

we issued  shares of our common stock to the public on march   which generated approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses 
at december   the combined total of our i cash and cash equivalents  ii short term investments and iii available for sale securities totaled million 
this is compared to million at december  our business generated million of cash from operations in compared to million in the increase in cash generated from operations was primarily due to increased domain name registrations

net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in compared to million in in substantially all of the financing activities were attributable to our initial public offering of our common stock 
in substantially all of the financing activities were private sales of equity securities 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures or other long term obligations  we anticipate that we will increase our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel  including the addition of new products and services  implementation of additional co location facilities and various capital expenditures associated with expanding our facilities 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience growth in our operating expenses for the foreseeable future and that our operating expenses will be a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that our existing cash and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk because all of our investments are in fixed rate  short term securities having a maturity of not more than two years with a majority having a maturity of under one year 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the fixed rate  short term nature of the substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
we did not have any foreign currency hedging or derivative instruments at december  we generally do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently utilize derivative financial instruments 
in one instance in  we purchased a put on shares of a public company that had acquired a privately owned company in which we had an investment 
we subsequently sold the put at a profit and also sold the shares of the underlying company at a profit 
while we have no present intention of utilizing derivative financial instruments in the future  it is possible that we may enter into similar transactions under comparable circumstances  should they arise 
we have no long term debt
