the increase in from of points was primarily the result of the increase in non deductible amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisitions  somewhat offset by the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be percent in discontinued operations after evaluating our strategic plans for the future  we elected to discontinue our equipment segment century lincoln and lincoln industrial businesses in the fourth quarter of discussions with potential purchasers are currently being held and we expect to dispose of these businesses in mid liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under credit agreements  and access to public equity and public and private debt markets have been our principal sources of liquidity over the past three years 
these funds covered our share repurchases  dividend payments  and investments in property  plant and equipment and acquisitions of businesses 
operating activities operating activities generated million in  compared with million in and million in the million increase in over was primarily due to lower receivables and extending payment terms with vendors 
the million increase in over primarily reflected a change in the timing of payments for accounts payable and higher earnings from continuing operations and depreciation and amortization driven by our acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable changes in other working capital accounts 
investing activities capital expenditures in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the million increase in over and the million increase in over  reflect increased investments as a result of acquisitions 
capital expenditures as a percent of sales were percent in both and and percent in we anticipate capital expenditures in to be between and million 
the anticipated increase in investments over is expected to be in the areas of tooling for new product development  factory expansion  and additional machinery and equipment for cost reductions and capacity expansion 
in  we acquired devilbiss air power company  the pressure vessel and pool and spa equipment businesses of essef corporation  and web tool manufacturing  inc for million 
in  we paid million for the acquisition of walker dickson group limited and an additional million for final payments related to acquisitions 
the acquisitions were financed through an equity offering and the issuance of additional debt 
financing activities as of the end of  our capital structure comprised of million in short term borrowings  million in long term debt  and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital was percent  compared with percent as of the end of our targeted debt to total capital ratio range is to percent 
we will exceed this target from time to time as needed for operational purposes and or acquisitions 
we have committed revolving credit facilities totaling million the facilities  consisting of a million day facility that expires on august   and million of multi currency facilities that expire on september  we are authorized to sell million of short term commercial paper notes with the facilities used as back up liquidity to support percent of commercial paper outstanding 
as of the end of  we had million of aggregate commercial paper outstanding that matures within days  of which  million was classified as long term and million was classified as short term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets 
the million has been classified as long term as we intend and have the ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
short term borrowings as of the end of consisted of million in bank borrowings under the day facility 
interest rates and fees on the facilities vary based on our debt ratings by credit rating agencies 
aggregate borrowings on the facilities had a weighted average interest rate of percent in and percent in in addition to the facilities  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities 
as of the end of  we had no borrowings under this agreement 
due to poor operating results in our tools and discontinued equipment segments  as well as restructuring charges taken in the fourth quarter  we determined that we could potentially be in violation of certain covenants under our facilities 
in december  we received a waiver modifying our interest coverage and leverage ratio covenants from our bank lenders 
subsequent to year end  we amended our facility agreements to modify these ratios through september  we will be required to meet our original interest coverage and leverage ratios as of the end of our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount paid for dividends and certain other payments  and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth 
under the most restrictive covenants  million of retained earnings were restricted as of the end of we were in compliance with all covenants  as modified 
in december  the credit rating agencies announced they were reviewing our ratings for possible downgrade 
since that announcement  we have been unable to access the commercial paper markets and have been refinancing maturing commercial paper with borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
if we continue to be unable to access the commercial paper markets or our credit ratings are lowered  our borrowing costs will increase 
we have sufficient liquidity under the facilities to refinance all outstanding commercial paper 
dividends paid in were million  compared with million in and million in the year over year increases reflect higher outstanding shares as a result of our secondary stock offering and an increase in our quarterly dividend rate to per share in the third quarter of from per share 
in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations 
we generated free cash flow of million in  compared with million in and million in we intend to increase our free cash flow by reducing inventories  improving collection of receivables  and working with suppliers to increase payment terms 
we also have changed our management incentive targets to include more emphasis on improving free cash flow 
we believe cash generated from operating activities  together with credit available under committed and uncommitted facilities and our current cash position will provide adequate short term and long term liquidity 
commitments and contingencies environmental under current laws and regulations  our obligations relating to environmental matters are not expected to have a material impact on our operations  financial condition  or operating results 
some subsidiaries face remediation of soil and groundwater as a result of predecessors or their own previous disposal practices 
in addition  our subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties at a small number of superfund or other sites being studied or remediated 
generally  the affected business has been deemed to be a de minimis defendant or its share of remediation costs has not been material 
we contractually retained certain obligations pertaining to environmental issues of discontinued paper businesses and the divested sporting ammunition business 
costs and capital expenditures related to environmental obligations were not material to our operations in the recent past and are not anticipated to be material in we engage environmental professionals to perform periodic audits of our facilities and to assist us in complying with the various environmental laws and regulations faced by our businesses 
for purposes of maintaining appropriate reserves against liabilities associated with environmental issues  whether involving on or off site locations  we review each individual site  taking into consideration the number of parties involved with the site  the joint and several liability imposed by certain environmental laws  the expected level of contributions of the other parties  the nature and quantities of wastes involved  the expected method and extent of remediation  the estimated professional expenses involved  and the time period over which any costs would be incurred 
based on this evaluation  reserves are established when loss amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
insurance recoveries are recorded only when claims for recovery are settled 
new accounting standards in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which among other guidance  clarified the staff s views on various revenue recognition and reporting matters 
as a result  we changed our method of accounting for certain sales transactions 
historically  we recognized revenue upon shipment of products to the customer because  even though some products were shipped fob destination  we used a common carrier and thus we gave up substantially all the risks of ownership 
under the new accounting method adopted retroactive to january   we now recognize revenue upon delivery of products to the customer  which is when title passes 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a minor non cash charge to income of million net of income taxes of million for the year ended december  the net effect of the change on the year ended december   was to increase income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by million per share 
the pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated statements of income were calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactively to prior periods 
for the three months ended march   we recognized million in revenue that was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of january  the effect of the revenue in the first quarter was to increase income by million after reduction for income taxes of million 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  will be required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item will be recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated in a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be recorded in other comprehensive incomes oci and will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings 
sfas defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use hedge accounting 
for a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge  changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
on january   we adopted sfas and recorded a transition adjustment that increased oci by million and will be reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in comprehensive income 
the transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities through december  prior to the application of sfas  financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges were not recorded in the financial statements  but cash flows from such contracts were recorded as adjustments to earnings as the hedged items effected earnings 
euro conversion a new currency  the euro  was introduced in europe on january  of the fifteen member countries of the european union  eleven adopted the euro as their legal currency on that date 
fixed conversion rates between the national currencies of these eleven countries and the euro were established on that date 
the national currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender as denominations of the euro during the transition period ending december  during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s national currency 
at the current time  we do not believe that the conversion to the euro will have a material impact on our business or financial condition
