item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin or the corporation is engaged in the conception  research  design  development  manufacture  integration and operation of advanced technology systems  products and services 
the corporation serves customers in both domestic and international defense and commercial markets  with its principal customers being agencies of the us government 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
strategic and organizational review in september  as part of a strategic and organizational review  the corporation announced plans to evaluate the divestiture of certain non core business units and the repositioning of certain businesses to maximize their value and growth potential 
in connection with its decision to evaluate the divestiture of certain non core business units  the corporation completed the sale of its aerospace electronics systems aes businesses to bae systems  north america inc bae systems in november in addition  in september  the corporation completed the sale of lockheed martin control systems control systems to bae systems 
these transactions are discussed in more detail under the caption divestiture activities below 
in january  the corporation completed the divestiture of two business units in the environmental management line of business 
the impact of these divestitures was not material to the corporation s consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position due to the effects of nonrecurring and unusual impairment losses recorded in and related to these business units 
these losses were included in other portfolio shaping activities 
the corporation is continuing to evaluate alternatives relative to the disposition of all or a portion of its investment in a business unit in the state and municipal services line of business  subject to appropriate valuation  negotiation and approval 
net sales for the year ended december  related to this business unit were million 
management cannot predict whether or when a potential divestiture will take place or the amount of proceeds that may ultimately be realized 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the corporation will continue to explore the sale of various investment holdings and surplus real estate 
if the corporation were to decide to sell any of its investment holdings or surplus real estate  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses  if any  would be recorded when they are estimable 
the corporation will also continue to review its businesses on an ongoing basis to identify ways to improve organizational effectiveness and performance  and to clarify and focus on its core business strategy 
in the third quarter of  the corporation completed its evaluation of alternatives relative to maximizing the value of two business units that serve the commercial information technology markets 
in october  the operations of one of the two business units  integrated business solutions ibs  were combined with the operations of lockheed martin global telecommunications lmgt  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation 
the remaining business unit  which provides lockheed martin s internal information technology needs  will continue to be operated as part of lockheed martin s corporate and other segment  consistent with prior periods 
business combination with comsat corporation in september  the corporation and comsat corporation comsat announced that they had entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement to combine the companies in a two phase transaction the merger 
subsequent to obtaining all regulatory approvals necessary for the first phase of the transaction and approval of the merger by the stockholders of comsat  the corporation completed a cash tender offer for percent of the outstanding stock of comsat the tender offer on september  the total value of this phase of the transaction was billion  and such amount was included in investments in equity securities in the consolidated balance sheet prior to consummation of the merger as discussed below 
the corporation accounted for its percent investment in comsat under the equity method of accounting 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  on august   pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  the second phase of the transaction was accomplished and the merger was consummated 
on that date  each share of comsat common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger other than shares held by the corporation was converted into the right to receive one share of lockheed martin common stock 
the total amount recorded related to this phase of the transaction was approximately billion based on the corporation s issuance of approximately million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
this price per share represents the average of the price of lockheed martin s common stock a few days before and after the announcement of the transaction in september the total purchase price for comsat  including transaction costs and amounts related to lockheed martin s assumption of comsat stock options  was approximately billion  net of cash balances acquired 
the comsat transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
purchase accounting adjustments were recorded in to allocate the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
these adjustments included certain amounts totaling approximately billion  composed of adjustments to record investments in equity securities acquired at their fair values and cost in excess of net assets acquired  which will be amortized over an estimated life of years 
the operations of comsat have been consolidated with the results of operations of lmgt since august  given the substantial investment necessary for the growth of the global telecommunications services business  support from strategic partners for the corporation s global telecommunications business area may be sought and public equity markets may be accessed to raise capital  although the corporation cannot predict the timing or the outcome of these efforts 
divestiture activities in connection with its strategic and organizational review  the corporation decided in july to sell its aes businesses to bae systems for billion in cash the aes transaction 
the aes transaction closed in november the corporation recorded a nonrecurring and unusual loss  including state income taxes  of million related to this transaction which is included in other income and expenses 
the loss negatively impacted the net loss for by million  or per diluted share 
although the aes transaction resulted in the corporation recording a pretax loss  it resulted in a gain for tax purposes primarily because cost in excess of net assets acquired goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and therefore was not included in the tax basis of the net assets of aes 
accordingly  the corporation is required to make state and federal income tax payments associated with the divestiture 
the aes transaction is expected to generate net cash proceeds of approximately billion after related transaction costs and federal and state income taxes which are expected to be paid in net sales included in the year related to the aes businesses totaled approximately million  excluding intercompany sales 
in september  the corporation completed the sale of control systems to bae systems for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of a nonrecurring and unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million which is reflected in other income and expenses 
the gain favorably impacted the net loss for the year ended december  by million  or 
per diluted share 
net sales for the first nine months of related to control systems totaled approximately million  excluding intercompany sales 
this transaction generated net cash proceeds of million after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
in september  the corporation completed the sale of approximately one third of its interest in inmarsat ventures limited inmarsat for million 
the investment in inmarsat was acquired as part of comsat in conjunction with the merger 
as a result of the transaction  the corporation s interest in inmarsat was reduced from approximately to 
the sale of shares in inmarsat did not impact the corporation s results of operations 
the transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately page continued million after transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
in  the corporation repositioned of its non core business units as a new independent company  l communications holdings  inc l  in which the corporation retained an approximate percent ownership interest at closing 
the corporation s ownership percentage was reduced to approximately percent in the second quarter of as a result of an initial public offering of l s common stock 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of a nonrecurring and unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million  and increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share 
in  the corporation sold its remaining shares of l in two separate transactions 
on a combined basis  these two transactions resulted in a nonrecurring and unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million  and increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share 
in september  the corporation sold its interest in airport group international holdings  llc which resulted in a nonrecurring and unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million 
in october  the corporation exited its commercial d graphics business through a series of transactions which resulted in the sale of its interest in real d  inc  a majority owned subsidiary  and a nonrecurring and unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million 
on a combined basis  these transactions increased net earnings by million  or 
per diluted share 
industry considerations the corporation s primary lines of business are in advanced technology systems  products and services for aerospace and defense  serving both government and commercial customers 
in recent years  domestic and worldwide political and economic developments have strongly affected these markets  requiring significant adaptation by market participants 
the us aerospace and defense industry has experienced years of pressures and uncertainties relative to budgets for research  development  test and evaluation  and procurement 
after over a decade of downward trends in the us defense budget  the portion of the federal budget devoted to defense is at one of its lowest levels in modern history 
in addition  worldwide defense budgets have been declining  with the limited funds available for such budgets targeted for operational readiness and personnel issues instead of acquisition programs 
an increasing portion of expenditures for defense is used for upgrading and modernizing existing equipment rather than acquisition of new equipment 
such trends in defense spending have created risks associated with demand and timing of orders relative to certain of the corporation s existing programs 
for example  though the corporation received several new orders for c j airlift aircraft in  the program since inception has not experienced the level of orders anticipated which has resulted in lower than expected production levels 
the corporation is continuing to focus its efforts on new orders from domestic and foreign customers  although it cannot predict the outcome of these efforts 
the industry participants reacted to shrinking defense budgets by combining to maintain critical mass and attempting to achieve significant cost savings 
the us government was supportive of industry consolidation activities through  and the corporation had been at the forefront of those activities 
through its own consolidation activities  the corporation has been able to pass along savings to its customers  principally the us department of defense dod 
more recently  major aerospace companies have focused their efforts on cost savings and efficiency improvements  as well as generation of cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation 
further domestic consolidation is possible  as evidenced by the proposed acquisition of litton industries  inc by northrop grumman corporation announced in ongoing consolidation continues within the european aerospace industry resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors  potentially resulting in an environment where there could be less demand for products from us companies 
such an environment could affect opportunities for european partnerships and sales potential for us products outside the us in addition  consolidation is beginning to occur between us and european aerospace companies  page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  as evidenced by the acquisition in of the corporation s aes and control systems businesses by a us subsidiary of bae systems plc 
there are signs that the continuing decline in the defense budget may have ended  with proposals being made for modest increases in the next several years 
however  the change of administration in washington  dc may result in significant alterations to current defense budgets and goals 
a new administration typically begins by reviewing existing programs and priorities  and president bush has instructed the secretary of defense to perform a top to bottom review of all defense expenditures 
he has also indicated a willingness to curtail spending on programs that may become technologically obsolete in the near future and may allocate additional funding for research and development projects as well as personnel needs 
the corporation cannot predict whether the defense budget will increase or the magnitude of such increases  if any 
if there are moderate increases in defense spending  the corporation s broad mix of programs and capabilities makes it a likely beneficiary of any such increases 
however  there are risks associated with certain of the programs for which the corporation is competing and which may be the primary recipients of significant future us government spending 
these programs are very large and likely to be well funded  but may only involve one prime contractor 
for example  the corporation is involved in the competition for the joint strike fighter jsf tactical aircraft program 
because of the magnitude of this program  being unsuccessful in the competition would be significant to any of the competitors future fighter aircraft operations 
additionally  the jsf program and other large  highly visible programs  such as the corporation s f fighter aircraft program  will likely receive significant attention in the administration s top to bottom review  and will continue to attract substantial congressional focus as potential targets for reductions and or extensions of their funding to pay for other programs 
however  the jsf and f programs remain a high priority for the dod and the armed services  as well as for the corporation 
in february  the f program completed the eleven test criteria established by the defense acquisition board dab which were required to be completed prior to the full contract award for the production of lot aircraft and the long lead procurement authorization for lot the corporation is currently awaiting further direction from the us government regarding authorization to begin initial production lot 
in january  the corporation received partial funding of lot which is adequate to continue necessary activities through the end of march also in january  the corporation received advance procurement funds to protect lot cost  schedule and the supplier base 
the us air force has advised the corporation of its intent to provide additional lot advance procurement funds in monthly increments prior to the f dab s final decision 
the second increment was received in february which covers efforts through the end of february 
the corporation cannot predict whether or when full funding will be received for the lot and lot phases of the f program 
as a government contractor  the corporation is subject to us government oversight 
the government may investigate and make inquiries of the corporation s business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting 
depending on the results of these investigations  the government may make claims against the corporation 
under us government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specified period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where the corporation conducts business 
although the outcome of such investigations and inquiries cannot be predicted  in the opinion of management  there are no claims  audits or investigations pending against the corporation that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business or its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the corporation remains exposed to other inherent risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties and obsolescence  changes in page continued government policies  and dependence on annual congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
many of the corporation s programs involve development and application of state of the art technology aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks and failures can occur 
it is important for the corporation to resolve performance issues related to such programs in a timely manner to achieve success on these programs 
the nature of the corporation s business also makes it subject to export control regulation by the us department of state and the department of commerce 
violations of these regulations can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
management is currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business or its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the corporation also conducts business in related commercial and non defense markets 
although these lines of business are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the risks associated with the corporation s defense businesses  as well as other risks unique to the commercial marketplace 
such risks include development of competing products  technological feasibility and product obsolescence 
industry wide  the launch vehicle industry experienced a reduction in demand beginning in primarily reflecting start up issues for certain satellite systems with which the corporation was not involved and delays in completing certain satellite systems due to excess transponder capacity in some regions 
these factors have resulted in pricing pressures in the launch vehicle industry associated with increased competition 
this comes at a time when the corporation is making significant investments in the evolved expendable launch vehicle atlas v program  the corporation s next generation of launch vehicles 
this program has required investment of funds for research and development  start up costs  certain other nonrecurring costs  and launch facilities 
a portion of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the us government 
orders to date relative to the program have been lower than expected  resulting in lower production levels than anticipated 
the above factors relative to start up issues and delays in completion of satellite systems also contributed to delays in commercial satellite orders 
in addition  similar to the launch vehicle industry  the commercial satellite industry is experiencing pricing pressures due to excess capacity as well as industry consolidation 
further impacting demand have been the business difficulties encountered by certain satellite systems  such as the bankruptcies of the iridium and ico systems in  which have resulted in increased investor scrutiny of new ventures and a reduction in the total market size in the near term 
the corporation has established cost objectives related to its launch vehicle and commercial satellite programs intended to allow it to continue to compete in these markets while maintaining its focus on successful operations  though it cannot predict the outcome of these efforts 
the corporation s global telecommunications segment is subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc with respect to various aspects of the telecommunications services it provides 
fcc decisions and policies have had  and may continue to have  a significant impact on the segment 
in march  congress passed the orbit act which permitted the corporation to complete its acquisition of comsat 
the orbit act also established deadlines for the privatization and completion of initial public offerings by the international telecommunications satellite organization intelsat  inmarsat and new skies satellites  nv new skies  as well as specific criteria for determining whether the privatizations of those entities are pro competitive 
if those criteria are not met  the fcc may limit access by us users to the satellite capacity of the privatized entities for certain services 
the corporation owns of intelsat  of inmarsat  and of new skies 
intelsat is working to complete a timely privatization in and plans to conduct an initial public offering in the future as mandated by the orbit act 
inmarsat privatized in and also plans to access the public capital markets 
new skies privatized in and completed an initial public offering in if intelsat and inmarsat were unable to satisfy the orbit act criteria and were denied us market access  the value of the corporation s investment in those entities could be adversely affected 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  in addition  pursuant to the orbit act  the fcc commenced a proceeding in to determine whether sufficient opportunities exist to directly access intelsat from the us if the fcc determines that such opportunities do not exist  it may take actions that could adversely affect the corporation s ability to utilize contractually committed future capacity on the intelsat system 
a decision is expected in the global telecommunications segment is also subject to substantial and increasing competition on a variety of fronts 
there has been an increase in the number of competing satellite systems and other telecommunications services providers in recent years  including a substantial deployment of undersea fiber cables 
many of those companies have plans to substantially increase capacity 
a number of the new satellite systems have had difficulty attracting customers and financing at the levels contemplated by their business plans following the bankruptcies of the iridium and ico satellite systems mentioned previously 
lmgt has investments in a number of new or development stage satellite systems  such as aces international  ltd 
aces and astrolink international  llc 
in addition  the corporation owns approximately of loral space communications ltd 
loral space  which is a major investor in globalstar telecommunications limited globalstar 
there can be no assurance that these ventures will be successful in attracting the financing necessary to complete and operate their systems or the customer bases required for profitable operations 
in connection with expanding its portfolio of offered products and services in commercial space and telecommunications activities  the corporation has entered into various joint venture  teaming and other business arrangements 
such arrangements generally include a formal plan for funding of the business which typically requires commitments for funding from the partners  and may require the business to obtain financing from other sources 
to the extent the business is unable to obtain such financing  the business partners  including the corporation  would be required to assess alternatives relative to further funding for the business 
in addition  some of these business arrangements include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into the corporation s operations  including fluctuating economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign jurisdictions and the potential for unanticipated cost increases and timing issues resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
in  the corporation entered into a joint venture with two russian government owned space firms to form lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei 
lockheed martin owns percent of lkei and consolidates the operations of lkei into its financial statements 
lkei has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton rocket from a launch site in kazakhstan 
in  another joint venture was formed  international launch services ils  with the corporation and lkei each holding a percent ownership 
ils was formed to market commercial atlas and proton launch services worldwide 
contracts for proton launch services typically provide for substantial advances from the customer in advance of launch  and a sizable percentage of these advances are forwarded to khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev  the manufacturer in russia  to provide for the manufacture of the related launch vehicle 
significant portions of such advances would be required to be refunded to each customer if launch services were not successfully provided within the contracted time frames 
at december   approximately million related to launches not yet provided was included in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  and approximately million of payments to khrunichev for launches not yet provided was included in inventories 
through year end  launch services provided through lkei and ils have been in accordance with contract terms 
the corporation has entered into agreements with rd amross  a joint venture of the pratt whitney division of united technologies corporation and the russian firm npo energomash  for the development and purchase  subject to certain conditions  of up to rd booster engines for use in two models of the corporation s atlas launch vehicle 
terms of the agreements call for payments to be made to rd amross upon the achievement of certain milestones in the development and manufacturing processes 
approximately million of payments made under these agreements were included in the corporation s inventories at december  page continued net sales in millions

results of operations the corporation s operating cycle is long term and involves many types of production contracts with varying production delivery schedules 
accordingly  the results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following comparative analysis should be viewed in this context 
the corporation s consolidated net sales for were billion  a decrease of one percent compared to net sales for were billion  a decrease of three percent compared to during  increases in net sales in the systems integration  technology services and global telecommunications segments compared to were more than offset by decreases in the remaining business segments

discussion of business segments the corporation operates in five principal business segments systems integration  space systems  aeronautics  technology services and global telecommunications 
all other activities of the corporation fall within the corporate and other segment 
the following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of the corporation s business segments correspond to additional segment information presented in note information on industry segments and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the third quarter of  lockheed martin began presenting lmgt  which includes the operations of comsat and ibs  as a separate segment called global telecommunications 
the operations of lmgt and ibs were previously included in the corporate and other segment 
earlier in  the corporation reassigned the management data systems business unit and the space applications systems line of business from the systems integration segment to the space systems segment 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to these organizational changes 
in millions net sales systems integration    space systems    aeronautics    technology services    global telecommunications corporate and other in millions operating profit loss systems integration space systems  aeronautics technology services global telecommunications corporate and other the following table displays the total impact on each segment s operating profit loss of the nonrecurring and unusual items presented earlier for each of the three years presented in millions segment effects of non recurring and unusual items operating loss profit systems integration space systems aeronautics technology services global telecommunications corporate and other in an effort to make the following discussion of significant operating results of each business segment more understandable  the effects of these nonrecurring and unusual items have been excluded 
the space systems and aeronautics segments generally include programs that are substantially larger in terms of sales and operating results than those included in the other segments 
accordingly  due to the large number of relatively smaller programs in the systems integration  technology services and global telecommunications segments  the impacts of performance by individual programs typically are not as significant to these segments overall results of operations 
page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  systems integration net sales of the systems integration segment increased by one percent in compared to  and increased by three percent in compared to for the year ended december  compared to  net sales increased by approximately million as a result of volume increases in the segment s naval electronic and surveillance systems product line and electronic platform integration activities 
net sales also increased by approximately million in the segment s missiles air defense product line  primarily as a result of the theater high altitude area defense thaad program s movement into the engineering  manufacturing and development emd phase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in net sales of approximately million related to the aes and control systems businesses primarily due to the divestiture of these businesses in the increase in was comprised of a million increase related to increased volume on surface systems activities  an million increase in volume on tactical training systems and a million increase in postal systems program activities 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in classified activities and space electronics programs 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to increased electronics activities in the united kingdom 
operating profit for the segment increased by two percent both in compared to and in compared to in  the previously mentioned volume increases in the segment s naval electronic and surveillance systems product line and electronic platform integration activities contributed approximately million to the increase in operating profit from this increase was partially offset by an approximate million decline in operating profit related to the aes and control systems businesses due to their divestiture in also during  increases in operating profit attributable to the thaad program s movement into the emd phase  as well as the absence in of a million penalty recorded on that program in the second quarter of  were offset by declines in operating profit on certain fire control and sensor programs due to program maturity 
the increase was comprised of a million increase related to the tactical training systems and postal systems volume increases discussed in the preceding paragraph as well as improved performance on missile and fire control programs 
these increases were offset by the aforementioned million penalty on the thaad program and the absence in of a million favorable arbitration resolution recorded in the remaining fluctuation in year over year operating profit related to declines in volume on various other systems integration activities 
space systems net sales of the space systems segment decreased by one percent in compared to  and by percent in compared to in  net sales decreased by approximately million due to volume declines in military  civil  and classified satellite activities  and by million due to decreased ground systems activities 
an additional million decrease related to reduced volume in government launch vehicle programs 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million related to increased volume on commercial space activities as well as an approximate million increase in various other space system activities 
year over year net sales also increased due to the absence in of approximately million in negative adjustments recorded during related to the titan iv program 
these adjustments included the effects of changes in estimates for award and incentive fees resulting from a second quarter titan iv launch failure  as well as a more conservative assessment of future program performance 
in addition  net sales were also favorably impacted by an approximate million adjustment recorded in on the titan iv program as a result of contract modifications and improved performance on the program 
the contract modifications  which resulted primarily from the us government s broad area review team recommendations  provided for a more balanced sharing of risk in the future 
the improved performance on the program resulted from the successful implementation of corrective actions and initiatives taken since the previously mentioned titan iv launch failure 
during  almost half of the segment s net sales decrease resulted from volume decreases page continued on military satellite programs and classified activities 
net sales were also reduced by a million decrease in commercial and civil satellite activities as a result of the maturity of certain programs and lower market demand 
net sales were further reduced by an approximate million decrease from related to ground systems activities  and by a million decrease in launch vehicle activities 
as mentioned previously  during the segment recorded a negative adjustment related to the titan iv program which reduced net sales by approximately million 
the remaining decrease in net sales was related to a decline in volume on various other space systems activities 
operating profit for the segment decreased by percent in compared to  and decreased by percent in compared to continued market and pricing pressures on commercial space programs  increased investment in certain launch vehicle programs and reduced margins on commercial satellites decreased operating profit by approximately million from this decrease included charges of approximately million recorded in on the atlas launch vehicle program related to continued market and pricing pressures 
in addition  operating profit was further reduced by approximately million due to the impact of the volume declines on military  civil  and classified satellite programs mentioned previously 
consistent with the change in net sales  the absence in of the negative adjustments recorded during on the titan iv program  combined with the favorable adjustments recorded in on the same program  had an approximate million positive impact on operating profit 
the remainder of the decrease is primarily attributable to an approximate million decrease in operating profit related to a more conservative assessment of future performance on government launch vehicle programs 
a contributing factor to the decrease in the segment s operating profit in compared to was the impact of a third quarter favorable adjustment of approximately million  net of state income taxes  which resulted from a significant improvement in the atlas program related to the retirement of technical and program risk 
in addition  operating profit was adversely affected by the impact of the million titan iv program adjustment discussed above 
operating profit in was also adversely impacted by increased period costs principally start up costs related to launch vehicle investments which accounted for approximately percent of the decrease  by a reduction in trident fleet ballistic missile activities that reduced operating profit by approximately million  and by a launch vehicle contract cancellation which resulted in a charge of million 
the remainder of the decrease is attributable to the decline in sales related to military satellite and classified activities mentioned above as well as a reduction in commercial satellite activities 
aeronautics net sales of the aeronautics segment decreased by percent in compared to  after having increased by one percent in compared to approximately percent of the decrease in net sales is attributable to declines in f fighter aircraft and c j airlift aircraft sales and deliveries 
these decreases more than offset increases in net sales related to the f fighter aircraft program 
the increase was comprised of million in increased sales related to c j program activities offset by a million decrease in f sales and deliveries 
the remaining increase was attributable to increased sales on various other aircraft programs 
operating profit for the segment increased by percent in compared to after decreasing by percent in compared to the current year increase is primarily attributable to the absence in of a million negative adjustment recorded during the second quarter of that resulted from changes in estimates related to the c j program due to cost growth and a reduction in production rates 
this increase was partially offset by an approximate million reduction in operating profit resulting from the decrease in aircraft sales and deliveries mentioned in the preceding paragraph 
the decrease from principally reflects the million negative impact of the previously mentioned c j program adjustment

approximately one half of these decreases were partially offset by new orders for commercial and civil satellites 
total aeronautics backlog increased by percent in compared to after decreasing by percent in compared to the increase is primarily due to approximately billion in orders related to the f fighter aircraft program  including new f contracts with the us government  the united arab emirates uae  israel  greece  singapore and korea  collectively

financing activities the corporation used billion in cash for financing activities during  compared to million provided by financing activities during and billion used during during  improved operating cash flows and cash provided by investing activities allowed the corporation to reduce its long term debt by approximately billion and decrease its net short term borrowings by million 
the reduction in long term debt was primarily attributable to the corporation s completion of tender offers for certain of its long term debt securities during the fourth quarter of the corporation used billion to consummate the tender offers  resulting in the early extinguishment of billion in long term debt and an extraordinary loss of million  or million after tax

approximately billion of customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  which are typically from foreign governments and commercial customers  were included in current liabilities at the end of capital structure and resources total debt  including short term borrowings  decreased by approximately percent during from approximately billion at december  the decrease was primarily the result of the completion of the tender offers mentioned previously 
the remaining change in debt was comprised of scheduled repayments of long term debt totaling approximately million and net repayments of short term debt of approximately million  primarily attributable to commercial paper repayments of approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million in debt assumed in conjunction with the comsat merger 
the corporation s long term debt is primarily in the form of publicly issued  fixed rate notes and debentures 
at year end  the corporation held cash and cash equivalents of approximately billion  a portion of which is expected to be used to meet scheduled long term debt maturities in total stockholders equity was billion at december   an increase of approximately million from the december  balance 
this increase resulted from the issuance of million shares of the corporation s common stock and the assumption of million comsat stock options related to the completion of the merger with comsat 
on a combined basis  these non cash items increased stockholders equity by approximately billion 
employee stock option and esop activities accounted for a further increase of approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the net loss of million  the payment of dividends of million and other comprehensive losses of approximately million primarily related to the temporary decline in value of the corporation s investment in loral space 
as a result of the above factors  the corporation s total debt to capitalization ratio decreased from percent at december  to percent at december at the end of  the corporation had in place a revolving credit facility in the amount of billion  which expires on december  the credit facility 
no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december  in march  the corporation filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission sec to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
the registration statement was declared effective on april  were the corporation to issue debt securities under this shelf registration  it would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of other debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
page continued the corporation actively seeks to finance its business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
the corporation s management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of the corporation s indebtedness 
periodically  the corporation may refinance existing indebtedness  vary its mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for its cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents including temporary investments  internally generated cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements and discretionary investment needs during the next twelve months 
consistent with the corporation s desire to generate cash to reduce debt and invest in its core businesses  management anticipates that  subject to prevailing financial  market and economic conditions  the corporation may continue to divest certain non core businesses  passive equity investments and surplus properties 
in connection with the uae s order for f fighter aircraft discussed previously  in june  the corporation issued a letter of credit in the amount of billion related to advance payments to be received under the contract 
at december   in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the uae  the amount of the letter of credit available for draw down in the event of the corporation s nonperformance under the contract was limited to the amount of advance payments received to date  or approximately million

effective march   the corporation converted its million shares of loral space series a preferred stock into an equal number of shares of loral space common stock 
the corporation plans to divest its shares of loral space  however  the timing of such divestitures and the related amount of cash received will depend on market conditions 
environmental matters as more fully described in note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements note  the corporation is responding to three administrative orders issued by the california regional water quality control board the regional board in connection with its former facilities in redlands  california 
the corporation estimates that expenditures required to implement work currently approved by the regional board related to the redlands facilities will be approximately million 
also in connection with the redlands facilities  the corporation is coordinating with the us air force  which is working with the aerospace and defense industry to conduct page management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  preliminary studies of the potential health effects of perchlorate exposure in connection with several sites across the country  including the redlands site 
the results of these studies will assist state and federal regulators in setting appropriate action levels for perchlorates in groundwater  which will in turn assist the corporation in determining its ultimate clean up obligation  if any  with respect to perchlorates 
also as mentioned in note  since  the corporation has been responding to various consent decrees and orders relating to soil and regional groundwater contamination in the san fernando valley including the cities of burbank and glendale associated with the corporation s former operations in burbank  california 
under an agreement reached with the us government and filed with the us district court in january the agreement  an amount equal to approximately percent of future expenditures for certain remediation activities will be reimbursed by the us government as a responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the corporation estimates that total expenditures required over the remaining terms of the consent decrees and orders related to the burbank and glendale facilities  net of the effects of the agreement  will be approximately million 
the corporation is a party to various other proceedings and potential proceedings related to environmental clean up issues  including matters at various sites where it has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
in the event the corporation is ultimately found to have liability at those sites where it has been designated a prp  the corporation anticipates that the actual burden for the costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean up and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  however  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  the corporation is potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that the corporation was required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that the corporation may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
among the variables management must assess in evaluating costs associated with these sites are changing cost estimates  continually evolving governmental environmental standards and cost allowability issues 
therefore  the nature of these environmental matters makes it extremely difficult to estimate the timing and amount of any future costs that may be necessary for remedial actions 
the corporation records appropriate financial statement accruals for environmental issues in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to the matters with respect to the redlands and burbank properties and the city of glendale described above  the corporation has accrued approximately million at december  for other matters in which an estimate of financial exposure could be determined 
management believes  however  that it is unlikely that any additional liability the corporation may incur for known environmental issues would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
also as more fully described in note  the corporation is continuing to pursue recovery of a significant portion of the unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the million fixed price contract with the us department of energy doe for the remediation of waste found in pit the corporation has been unsuccessful to date in reaching any agreements with the doe on cost recovery or other contract restructuring matters 
in  the management contractor for the project  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  at the doe s direction  terminated the pit contract for default 
at the same time  the corporation filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the default termination 
subsequently  the corporation took actions to raise the status of its request for equitable adjustment to a formal claim 
also page continued in  the management contractor  again at the doe s direction  filed suit against the corporation seeking recovery of approximately million previously paid to the corporation under the pit contract 
the corporation is defending this action in which discovery has been pending since august in october  the us court of federal claims stayed the doe s motion to dismiss the corporation s lawsuit  finding that the court has jurisdiction 
the court ordered discovery to commence and gave leave to the doe to convert its motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment if supported by discovery 
the corporation continues to assert its position in the litigation while continuing its efforts to resolve the dispute through non litigation means 
other matters the corporation s primary exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the corporation s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk principally include variable rate commercial paper and fixed rate long term debt 
the corporation s long term debt obligations are generally not callable until maturity 
the corporation may use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  however  there were no such agreements outstanding at december  the corporation uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
these contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions  and related gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs 
effective january   the corporation began accounting for these contracts under the provisions of sfas no 
 as amended 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding  as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended  were not material 
the corporation does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
