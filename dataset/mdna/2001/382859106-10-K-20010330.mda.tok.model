item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report 
overview on january   we announced actions to focus our business on our internet roaming service  and to cease our internet telephony service 
following this restructuring  we provide services and software that enable our customers to offer internet based mobile office communications services  such as internet roaming  to their end users worldwide 
our customers include telecommunications companies  internet service providers  corporate enterprises and newly emerging communications service providers 
from our inception until we were both an internet service provider in northern california and an independent software developer for the internet service provider community 
in  we sold our local internet service provider business and related assets 
we first recognized settlement clearinghouse revenues in  and since we have derived our revenues primarily from settlement clearinghouse services 
from late until january  our settlement clearinghouse services included internet telephony services which are characterized by high revenues with low margins 
we no longer provide internet telephony services as a result of our decision to focus on globally providing internet based mobile office communications services 
settlement revenues are generated when we provide settlement services to customers whose end users initiate internet communications 
for each global internet roaming transaction  we track the usage  collect the amount that a roamer s home service provider owes us  pay the appropriate amount to the service provider enabling local access  and provide the underlying usage data to our customer to enable billing of its end user 
although we have discontinued our internet telephony service  our revenues during the year ended december  were primarily from settlement revenues generated from internet telephony transactions 
previously  for these transactions  we used our software to track the telephony call usage  settle the amounts owed to us and by us as a result of the transaction  and provide the underlying usage data to our customers to enable billing of their end users 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception as a result of expenses associated with building our gric alliance and related network infrastructure and developing our software products 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
see factors that may affect future results we have not been profitable to date and we anticipate continued losses during our business model has evolved in the course of our development and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our future prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
see factors that may affect future results our operating history is more limited than that of many other companies  so you may find it difficult to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
results of operations compared to revenues total revenues consisting of settlement revenues and software and other revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the primary reason for the growth was increased settlement revenues 
settlement revenues 
settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase primarily reflects higher volumes of both internet telephony and internet roaming minutes 
as a result of our january restructuring  we have ceased providing internet telephony settlement services 
we expect settlement revenues from internet roaming to increase in the near future and total settlement revenues in to exceed total settlement revenues in software and other revenues 
software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our prepaid internet telephony software services and discontinued sales of internet telephony hardware  offset by higher sales to license certain components of our internet roaming clearinghouse software 
we expect software and other revenues to represent an insignificant component of total revenues in costs and expenses cost of settlement revenues 
cost of settlement revenues represents the amounts we pay to access the internet for internet roaming services for our customers  and to terminate internet telephony services for our customers 
cost of settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher sales volumes of our internet telephony services as well as the higher proportion of our total services revenue mix that these lower margin services represented 
for example  in the fourth quarter of we experienced negative margins associated with our internet telephony services 
margins associated with our internet roaming services have consistently exceeded throughout we expect cost of settlement revenues to decrease as a percentage of total settlement revenues as a result of ceasing our internet telephony service and focusing on internet roaming services 
cost of software and other revenues 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues represents license fees for third party software that is incorporated into our software products  and the cost of internet telephony equipment 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the discontinued sales of hardware and lower maintenance and services costs for internet telephony services 
we expect the cost of software and other revenues in to be insignificant 
network and operations 
network and operations expenses include costs of co location of network equipment and leased telecommunication lines  salaries  benefits  depreciation on network equipment  and allocated facility and management information systems costs 
network and operations expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was due to higher levels of business activity and higher costs associated with the expansion of our customer support and network operation centers 
we expect that network and operations expenses will decrease in as we ceased providing our internet telephony service in the first quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  allocated facility  outside consultants  depreciation costs and recruiting costs of employees  quality assurance and management information systems 
research and development increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases were primarily due to the costs of engineers engaged in the continued development of our proprietary settlement software and internet roaming software 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
we expect to reduce overall research and development costs during as a result of the decreased complexity of our settlement services model following our january restructuring of operations 
we also intend to reduce costs by licensing commercially available third party software to supplement our internal efforts to develop and maintain our proprietary settlement software 
further  we expect our recent establishment of an offshore development center in india to assist us in reducing our expenses in due to the favorable costs of obtaining engineering talent in india compared to the san francisco bay area 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  benefits and commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  allocated facility  management information systems and depreciation costs  cost for marketing and promotional programs  and costs associated with our domestic and international sales offices 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases reflect the hiring and recruitment of additional personnel to expand our geographic coverage and to support the growth of our global internet roaming and telephony services 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat based on our january decision to cease providing internet telephony services and focus on our internet roaming services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of general corporate and facility costs as well as salary  benefits and related costs for executive  finance  legal  investor relations  administrative  human resources and management information systems functions  as well as provisions for uncollectible receivables 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase reflects the hiring of additional personnel and consultants to provide the infrastructure to support future growth  as well as increases in professional services fees 
we expect these expenses to increase in  but at a substantially lower rate of increase than we experienced in amortization of stock based compensation 
some stock options granted during fiscal were considered compensatory  as the estimated fair value for accounting purposes was greater than the stock exercise price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
as a result  we have recorded expenses of  in and  in relating to the amortization of deferred compensation expense 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
we expect amortization of approximately  in each of fiscal and and  in fiscal interest income and other  net interest income and other  net primarily represents interest income on cash and investment balances 
interest income and other  net increased to million in from  in this increase was due to higher average cash and investment balances during the year as a result of the company s initial public offering in december interest expense interest expense consists of amortization of interest expense associated with capital leases and bridge financing and the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our financing activities 
interest expense decreased to  in from million in the decrease was primarily due to no additional warrants being offered in  as well as the conversion of bridge loans to preferred stock in the second quarter of income taxes the provision of income taxes increased to  in from  in the provision for income taxes consists of foreign taxes 
sfas statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes the company s historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
we intend to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
compared to revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
both settlement revenues and software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues grew significantly during settlement revenues 
settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases reflect higher volumes of both internet roaming and internet telephony transactions 
software and other revenues 
software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues increased to million in from  in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our prepaid internet telephony software and related maintenance and services  which we introduced in february  and higher sales of our internet roaming software and related maintenance and services  offset by a reduction of hardware sales  which we discontinued in june costs and expenses cost of settlement revenues 
cost of settlement revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher sales volumes in our internet roaming and internet telephony services 
cost of software and other revenues 
cost of software  hardware and maintenance and services revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily attributable to our decision to no longer resell certain software and hardware products 
network and operation 
network and operations expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was due to higher business activity and higher costs associated with the expansion of our customer support and network operation centers to a hours a day  seven days a week basis 
research and development 
research and development increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to the continuing development of our gric csp software 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases reflect the hiring of additional personnel to expand the geographic coverage of  and to support  internet telephony  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increases reflect the hiring of additional personnel  including key executives  to provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
amortization of stock based compensation 
we have recorded expenses of  in relating to the amortization of deferred compensation expense 
other expenses reversals 
other expense reversals of  reflects a reduction of a previously expensed commitment to purchase software  as a result of the completion of a settlement agreement with the software vendor 
the previous expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of when we determined that the software product was not salable and expensed million 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances during interest expense interest expense increased to million in from  in due to the amortization of the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our financing activities and interest expense associated with capital leases and bridge financing 
income taxes the provision of income taxes increased to  in from  in liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in operating activities in  and was primarily a result of net operating losses 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments arising from the funds received from the initial public offering 
other uses of cash in investing activities consisted of purchases of computer hardware  relating to the network infrastructure  and computer hardware and software  for our increasing employee base 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from sales of common stock through incentive stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in  we completed our initial public offering  which raised million net of costs 
in we had funded our operations primarily through private placement of our convertible preferred stock 
we also financed our operations through equipment promissory notes 
commitments 
we lease all of our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through as of december   we had million in future operating lease commitments and million of capital lease obligations and equipment promissory notes 
in the future we expect to continue to finance the acquisition of computer and network equipment through additional capital lease arrangements 
in january  we ceased our internet telephony service  as part of a corporate restructuring 
as a result  we anticipate a cash restructuring charge in in the range of to million associated with the elimination of certain lease and facility obligations 
summary of liquidity 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented on a going concern basis 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  and expect such losses to continue during we recently announced  on january   certain actions to focus our efforts on our internet roaming service  and to cease providing our internet telephony service 
our restructuring plan was designed to reduce our operating expenses in  primarily through anticipated savings attributable to internet telephony related sales and marketing as well as network and operating expenses 
the cost cutting plan includes a reduction of employee workforce  elimination of leased bandwidth to operate our internet telephony backbone and elimination of costs to operate our internet telephony equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing operating expenses in the future 
we anticipate a cash restructuring charge in in the range of to million as a result of these actions 
we plan to invest in expanding our internet roaming and related services  on a global basis  by continuing to build strategic partnering relationships 
this will require us to maintain continued favorable market acceptance and growth of our internet roaming and related services offerings in order for us to continue our research and development activities and fund planned operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that our internet roaming product offerings will maintain continued favorable market acceptance  growth and operating margins 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   future cash savings as a result of ceasing to provide our internet telephony service  and cash expected to be generated by operations during will be adequate to fund planned operations through december  if we are unable to attain our revenue and margin goals  significant reductions in spending and the delay or cancellation of planned activities or more substantial restructuring may be necessary to enable us to meet our cash requirements through at least december  these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and prospects 
furthermore  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other arrangements to fund operations and potential acquisitions  if any 
we may never achieve profitability 
any additional financing  if needed  might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
 as amended by no 
and  establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities 
the company is required to implement sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal year as the company does not currently engage in derivatives or hedging transactions  there is no impact to the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows of adopting sfas no 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies 
in october  the sec issued further guidance with respect to adoptions of specific views addressed by sab no 
the adoption of sab no 
had no impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of opinion no 
for certain issues including a the definition of employee for purposes of applying opinion no 
 b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan  c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award  and d the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination 
in general  the interpretation is effective july  the adoption of interpretation no 
had no impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the information in this annual report on form k  the following should be considered in evaluating gric and our business 
we recently restructured our business  which makes our financial results more difficult to analyze 
in january  we restructured our business by ceasing to provide our internet telephony service and focusing on our internet roaming service 
as a result  we reduced our employee workforce and eliminated some network and operating expenses 
we expect to record significant charges for restructuring expenses  such as expenses in connection with the workforce reduction  reduction of sales and marketing and termination of network and telephony service agreements 
we cannot assure you that the expenses that we will incur as part of the restructuring will not be higher than currently anticipated 
further  the termination of our internet telephony service will mean that telephony revenues will be eliminated and our internet roaming service will become our primary source of revenue 
this concentration of our revenues makes us more dependent on the growth of the internet roaming market in general  and will increase the negative impact on our business if our internet roaming product offerings do not maintain favorable market acceptance and growth or achieve our revenue and margin targets 
the restructuring may also lead to resignations by key employees  which could harm our operations and financial results 
our financial performance and workforce reduction may adversely affect our ability to retain and hire personnel 
in connection with the transition to our new business model and in order to reduce our cash expenses  in january we announced our decision to cease providing internet telephony services and a related workforce reduction 
in addition  recent trading levels of our common stock have decreased the value of the stock options granted to employees pursuant to our stock option plan 
as a result of our january restructuring and the recent decline in price of our common stock  our personnel may seek opportunities with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
additionally  in order to implement our internet based mobile office communications services model successfully  we will need to retain and hire personnel 
specifically  our sales efforts require highly trained sales personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire these individuals  they require extensive training in our products and services 
if we are unable to continue to expand our sales operations  retain our current employees and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from generating revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
our operating history is more limited than that of many other companies  so you may find it difficult to evaluate our business in making an investment decision 
we have limited experience in developing and providing our products and services 
since our inception  we have had limited revenues from our current internet based communications software products and services 
in the past we have undertaken development of software products which were either not completed or not delivered on time 
we have also discontinued products that did not achieve widespread market acceptance 
many members of our senior management team and other employees have worked with us for only a short period of time 
consequently  we have not demonstrated that our business can succeed 
we have not been profitable to date and we anticipate continued losses during to date  we have not been profitable 
we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability 
we reported operating losses before income taxes of million for  million for and million for as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur operating losses during in particular  we expect to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  and we expect to face pressure to adopt new pricing arrangements  including volume discounts  that may lower our gross margins 
if revenues do not meet levels we anticipate  or if our costs and expenses exceed our expectations  we will continue to sustain losses  and our business and the price of our common stock may be harmed 
we may require additional capital for our operations  which could have a negative effect on your investment 
we currently anticipate that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through december  however  we may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to fund operations or acquisitions 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution and these securities may have powers  preferences and rights that are senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our business transaction  promote our brand identity  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures 
any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our ability to maintain and increase our customer base 
customers are generally free to use competing products and services  so we could face significant customer losses 
our customers are generally not obligated to generate minimum revenues  and some generate very little revenue for us 
these factors make it difficult to anticipate the level of our future revenues from existing customers 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to expand our customer base 
if we lose any significant customer or are unable to expand our customer base and to increase our average revenues per customer  our business will be harmed 
we depend on our customers to market internet based communications services to their end users  so our revenues depend on the activities of others and the market acceptance of those services 
our business depends on the efforts and success of our customers in marketing internet based communications services to their end users 
we have little ability to promote those services 
if our customers fail to market internet based communications services effectively  our revenues would be reduced 
we face significant competition  including competition from larger companies 
there are low barriers to entry by businesses seeking to offer services on the internet 
as a result  our business environment is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
competition can come from many sources 
for example  we compete directly with ipass in the market for internet roaming and related settlement services  and ipass has a network that competes with the gric alliance 
large communications service providers such as at t and uunet also have the ability and resources to compete with us in the internet based mobile office communications services market 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have 
any of these competitors may combine or form strategic partnerships  gaining competitive advantages as a result 
our competitors may be able to develop and market products and services that are superior to our own in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
in that event  our products and services may not achieve the market acceptance necessary for us to achieve success 
if we are unable to manage growth  the gric alliance and our product development efforts effectively  our business and the price of our stock will be harmed 
in recent periods  growth has strained our network operations  product development and other managerial  operating and financial resources 
we expect these strains to continue if we continue our growth  and our financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we must manage our research and development efforts  expand the capacity  scalability and performance of our network and software infrastructure  enhance our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  improve coordination among our engineering  accounting  finance  marketing and operations personnel  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
if we are not able to accomplish these tasks  our business will be harmed 
our customers require a high degree of reliability in the delivery of our services  and if we cannot meet their expectations for any reason  demand for our products and services will suffer 
our success depends in large part on our ability to assure generally error free clearinghouse services  uninterrupted operation of our network and software infrastructure  and a satisfactory experience for our customers end users 
to achieve these objectives  we depend on the quality  performance and scalability of our products and services  the responsiveness of our technical support and the capacity  reliability and security of our network operations 
we also depend on third parties over which we have no control 
for example  our ability to serve approximately countries is based solely on our network access agreement with one service provider and on that service provider s ability to provide reliable internet access points in those countries 
in the past  we have experienced problems due to our inability to detect system malfunctions and due to errors in collecting or processing account usage and settlement data 
due to the high level of performance required for critical communications traffic  any failure to deliver a satisfactory experience to end users  whether or not caused by our own failures  and any failure to provide accurate settlement data in connection with acting as a clearinghouse  could reduce demand for our products and services 
as a clearinghouse  we have greater collection risks than many other companies 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable will harm our financial results  and this collection risk is inherently greater for us as a clearinghouse service provider because we are obligated to pay amounts owed to each customer whether or not we have collected all the amounts due to us from other customers 
in addition  if end users or unauthorized third parties engage in unauthorized or otherwise fraudulent roaming activity  we may face difficulty collecting the resulting accounts receivable 
if we are not able to manage this problem  our financial results will suffer 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and services  we will be less likely to attract or retain customers 
we expect the market for internet based communications products and services to continue to change rapidly 
to succeed  we will be required to adapt to those changes by improving and enhancing our existing products and services  and developing and introducing new products and services 
we have not demonstrated that we can consistently develop and market product enhancements and new products or services on a timely or on a cost effective basis 
on several occasions  we have altered the course of our product development efforts or discontinued products after their introduction  which has resulted in delays and increased research and development expenses 
if we fail to produce technologically competitive products and services in a cost effective manner and on a timely basis  our business will be harmed 
our operating results fluctuate and are difficult to predict  so we may fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or market analysts and our stock price may decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect them to fluctuate in the future 
factors that cause these fluctuations  many of which are beyond our control  include the volume of transaction based revenues  management of growth  the timing of deployment of services by new customers  the rate at which customers use our services  economic conditions specific to the internet  as well as general economic and market conditions  our ability to avoid problems in managing the gric alliance network  our dependence on the timely and successful launch of future products and services  intense competition  particularly pricing policy changes by our competitors  the mix of services used by our customers end users  our ability to collect accounts receivable  particularly for customers based outside the us  and the domestic and international regulatory environment 
business models relying on the internet to provide internet based communications services are still evolving 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results are not meaningful 
additionally  if our operating results in one or more quarters do not meet or exceed securities analysts or market expectations  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our long sales cycle makes it particularly difficult for us to forecast revenues  requires us to incur high costs of sales  and aggravates fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
our business is characterized by a long sales cycle  including contact with a potential customer  establishment of a new customer relationship  winning the new customer and realizing significant transaction based revenues 
this makes it difficult for us to predict future revenues 
in addition  we incur substantial sales costs before we win a customer or recognize any related revenues  which increases the volatility of our results because we may have high costs without associated offsetting revenues 
because much of our business is conducted internationally  we encounter special payment and regulatory difficulties  which may reduce our profitability and harm the price of our common stock 
because we generate most of our revenues from business conducted internationally  we are subject to special risks 
those risks include longer payment cycles for foreign customers  including delays due to currency controls and fluctuations  negative impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  potentially high taxes in foreign countries  difficulties complying with a variety of foreign laws  trade standards and tariffs and of overcoming trade barriers  and difficulties complying with telecommunications and other internet related regulations in many foreign jurisdictions 
we are also exposed to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
any of these factors may reduce our profitability and harm the price of our common stock 
we need to hire and retain qualified personnel to sustain the growth of our business  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other companies in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
our future success depends  in part  on the continued service of our key executive  management and technical personnel  and our ability to attract new skilled employees 
from time to time we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees  and we expect to continue to experience this sort of difficulty 
competition for employees in our industry is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are located  and we have experienced significant attrition  particularly after our recent restructuring of operations 
continued declines in the market price of our common stock could also hurt employee morale and retention 
if we are not able to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future  our business could be harmed because our growth might be slowed or executive leadership might be disrupted 
litigation arising out of intellectual property infringement or other commercial disputes could be expensive and disrupt our business 
we cannot be certain that our products do not  or will not  infringe upon patents  trademarks  copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in addition  since we rely on third parties to help us develop  market and support our product and service offerings  we cannot assure you that litigation will not arise from disputes involving those third parties 
from time to time we have been  and we expect to continue to be  parties to disputes with these third parties 
we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these claims  regardless of their merit 
successful claims against us may result in substantial monetary liability  significantly impact our results of operations in one or more quarters or materially disrupt the conduct of our business 
our executive officers and directors hold a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   our executive officers and directors and their affiliated entities owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  acting together  will have a substantial influence on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover and depress our stock price 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  and this may potentially lower the price of our common stock 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for the election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we have elected to remain subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law 
these factors may discourage takeover attempts 
if our common stock price falls below and remains under  or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could severely limit the trading market for our common stock 
if the market price for our common stock falls and remains below per share  our market capitalization falls and remains below million or we otherwise fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be deemed to be penny stock 
on march   the closing price of our common stock was 
if our common stock is considered penny stock  it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices on broker dealers who sell our securities 
for example  broker dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
also  a disclosure schedule must be prepared prior to any transaction involving a penny stock and disclosure is required about sales commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities 
monthly statements are also required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock 
because of these additional obligations  some brokers may be unwilling to effect transactions in penny stocks 
this could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and your ability to sell the common stock 
our stock price has been volatile and losses by investors could lead to shareholder lawsuits 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile recently  and often these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
this increases the risk that if you wish to sell our stock the market price may be lower than the price at which you purchased our stock 
our common stock reached a high of and traded as low as during if the market value of our stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in class actions lawsuits by security holders  we could incur substantial legal costs and management s attention could be diverted  to the detriment of our operations and results 
we expect the market price for our common stock to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of factors including quarterly variations in our operating results  our recent decision to restructure our business  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors  investor perception of us  the market for internet based communications services or the internet in general  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general economic and market conditions 
future developments in internet based communications services  which are critical to our success  are uncertain 
for us to increase our revenues  the internet must be validated as an effective medium for the delivery of internet roaming and other internet based communications services 
the infrastructure of the public internet may not be able to support increased demands placed on it  and the performance of the internet may be adversely affected 
our business will be harmed if the internet does not continue to grow as a telecommunications medium  and that growth may be inhibited by factors such as unreliability of the internet infrastructure  security concerns  new regulatory requirements  inconsistent quality of service  and lack of availability of cost effective service 
security concerns may deter the use of the internet for internet based communications which would reduce demand for our products and services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to widespread adoption of electronic commerce and communications 
the internet is a public network and information is sent over this network from many sources 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in compromised security on our network or the networks of others 
if any well publicized compromises of confidential information were to occur  it could reduce demand for internet based communications and our products and services 
us or foreign governmental regulations regarding the internet and internet based services may be enacted  which could impede our business 
to date  governmental laws and regulations applicable to access to or commerce on the internet have not materially restricted use of the internet in our markets 
however  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and may change 
for example  congress and other federal entities have adopted or are considering legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the internet and internet based services 
the european union has enacted several directives relating to the internet  including one which affects us companies that collect or transmit information over the internet from individuals in european union member states 
new domestic or foreign taxes could also be adopted that would apply to the delivery or use of communications services over the internet 
uncertainty about and adoption of new regulations could increase our costs of doing business  or prevent us from delivering our products and services over the internet or significantly slow the growth of the internet 
this could delay growth in demand for our products and services and harm our business 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks foreign currency risk 
we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
although we have foreign operations in europe and asia  to date  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not been significant 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
interest rate risk occurs when we cannot hold a purchased investment to its maturity 
we limit the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio to days 
we intend to hold our securities until maturity and  therefore  do not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
we have established policies and business practices regarding our investment portfolio to preserve principal while obtaining reasonable rates of return without significantly increasing risk 
we place investments with high credit quality issuers according to our investment policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all investments are carried at fair market value for due to the short term nature of our investments and the immaterial amount of our debt obligation  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest fluctuation 
therefore  no accompanying table has been provided
