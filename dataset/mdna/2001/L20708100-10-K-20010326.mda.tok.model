item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the group s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
general the group generates revenues by leasing to ocean carriers  marine containers that are owned either by managed container owners or by the group itself 
these leases  which generate most of the group s revenues  are generally operating leases 
the segment information presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements relates to the portions of the group s fleet owned by the group itself owned containers  or by the group s managed container programs managed container owners  which are comprised of us limited partnerships and other container owners 
owned containers include containers held for resale  the financing costs of which are borne by the group prior to the sale of such containers to managed container owners  and are accounted for in the owned container segment 
the group bears the risk of ownership with respect to containers in owned containers but not with respect to the majority of containers in the managed container owners segments  although the group bears the risk that the management agreements could be terminated  resulting in the removal of the corresponding managed containers from the fleet 
at december   approximately  and of the group s fleet by original equipment cost was owned by us limited partnerships  other container owners and owned containers  respectively 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the group has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the group s management agreements with the managed container owners meet the definition of leases in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 they are accounted for in the group s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the group is lessee 
the agreements with container owners generally provide that the group will make payments to the container owners based upon the rentals collected from ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and a management fee 
the majority of payments to container owners are therefore contingent upon the leasing of the containers by the group to ocean carriers and the collection of lease rentals 
minimum lease payments on the agreements  which have fixed payment terms are presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements 
in  over of payments to container owners represented agreements under which the amounts payable to managed container owners were contingent upon the leasing of containers to ocean carriers and the collection of lease rentals 
gross lease revenue represents revenue from operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed in us dollars on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the group at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under short term and long term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally payable monthly 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon fleet growth  utilization rates and per diem rates 
the group has expanded its fleet since december  from  teu to  teu at december  the following chart summarizes the combined utilization of the cronos fleet based on approximate original equipment cost utilization at december average utilization during the year during the first three quarters of  increased demand in many locations  but most significantly throughout asia  resulted in growth in the volume of containerized trade 
in the fourth quarter of  the economic slowdown that materialized in the united states and other locations resulted in reduced demand for containerized trade and utilization for the combined fleet fell to 
during  inventories of idle equipment decreased in europe but there has been no appreciable reduction in the us where imports continue to exceed exports 
the group will seek to strengthen utilization by repositioning off hire equipment to locations of greatest demand and by pursuing leasing opportunities through its global network of marketing resources 
in recent years  the group has increased its ownership of cpcs and rolltrailers 
due to their specialized nature  the demand for these products is less likely to be affected by global economic downturns 
utilization for both cpcs and rolltrailers was over at december  the rate of decline in per diem rates in was not as steep as in preceding years where rates were under strong downward pressure due to the combined effects of rationalization in the global shipping industry and competitive market conditions 
over the course of  the group s combined per diem rate fell by approximately from the combined rate at december  commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the group s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases principally containers leased under lease purchase arrangements  license fee income earned in connection with the manufacture and sale of cpcs for which the group owns the patent see fleet profile above  fees from the disposal of used containers  and miscellaneous other fees and income 
this item is affected by the size of new managed programs  the purchase price of containers acquired for new managed programs  the quantity of cpcs manufactured and sold  the number and value of direct financing leases and income from disposals of used containers 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are amortized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing containers  both owned and managed 
these expenses may be categorized as activity related  inventory related  and  legal and other 
activity related expenses include agents costs and depot costs such as repairs  maintenance and handling 
inventory related expenses relate to off hire containers and comprise storage and repositioning costs 
these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered 
legal and other expenses include legal costs and provisions for doubtful accounts 
payments to container owners reflect the amounts due to managed container owners  computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  professional fees and computer systems costs 
operating profit or loss  for reported segments  includes items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the group s operating segments 
it also includes items not directly attributable to any specific container 
such indirect items are allocated across operating segments 
items directly attributable to operating segments include gross lease revenue  direct operating expenses  payments to container owners  container interest and container depreciation expense 
indirect items allocated across segments include selling  general and administrative expenses  interest  depreciation and impairment charges on the group s non container assets

new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
under sfas  certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
the group will adopt sfas effective january  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the group 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the group adopted sab no 
 as amended  as of december  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a significant impact on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the group 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the group s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table sets forth principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations at december  expected maturity date of debt and capital lease obligations and thereafter us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations fixed rate us     average interest rate variable rate us       average interest rate interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december   of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the group conducted an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the current balance outstanding  leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase were applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk substantially all of the group s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
approximately of costs in were incurred and paid in us dollars 
of the remaining costs  approximately are individually small  unpredictable and were incurred in various denominations 
thus  such amounts are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
as exchange rates are outside of the control of the group  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every incremental decline in value of the us dollar against various foreign currencies  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any given year
