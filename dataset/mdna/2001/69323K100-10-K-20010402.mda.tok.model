any launch of a new business venture or any acquisition and the ensuing integration of the operations of the acquired company with those of the company would place additional demands on the company s management  operating and financial resources 
the company currently has no definitive agreements with respect to any acquisitions 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results  and the company does not expect it to have such an impact in the near future

impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the new rules will be effective the first quarter of the company does not believe that the new standard will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  as the company currently holds no derivatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and long term debt 
at march   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
it is the company s policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
the company does not have any significant foreign currency exposure since it does not transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  the company does not have significant overall currency exposure at march
