historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included  and any trends which may appear to be inferred  should not be taken as being necessarily indicative of trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods 
pab has made  and may continue to make  various forward looking statements with respect to financial and business matters 
comments regarding pab s business which are not historical facts are considered forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements 
for additional information regarding forward looking statements  see pab s cautionary disclosures at the beginning of this document 
was a year of growth  consolidation and conversion for pab 
the year began with the successful implementation of pab s yk plan and ended with the acquisition of a new bank subsidiary 
in the second quarter  the holding company officers and staff moved into the new holding company building 
in the fourth quarter  the banks opened two new branch offices and began the construction of a third 
during the third quarter and fourth quarters  pab successfully converted its core data processing  atm s  imaging  internet banking  deposit platform  payroll  general ledger and accounts payable systems 
pab also upgraded its communications equipment  network servers and wide area network 
this conversion took significant resources away from the normal business of the banks and the holding company for most of the second half of the year 
as a result  pab incurred additional costs during that period 
the conversion process will continue into with ongoing training on the new systems and the loan platform and document imaging conversion projects 
with the conversion to new systems  pab also began an effort to consolidate and centralize the accounting and operations functions from the bank level to the holding company 
these steps taken in to build the necessary infrastructure are a part of pab s long term strategy for growth and prosperity 
at the close of business on december   pab consummated its merger with friendship community bank friendship 
this transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
since this transaction became effective after the last business day of the year  none of the results of operations for friendship are included with pab s consolidated statements of income

the change in interest attributable to rate has been determined by applying the change in rate between years to average balances outstanding in the later year 
the change in interest due to volume has been determined by applying the rate from the earlier year to the change in average balances outstanding between years

approximately of the investment portfolio is rated a or better by moody s investors service  inc non rated securities are principally issued by various political subdivisions within the state of georgia 
the portfolio is carefully monitored to assure there is no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor 
loan portfolio a sound credit policy and careful  consistent credit review are vital to a successful lending program 
the banks operate under written loan policies which attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy  provide sound traditional credit decisions  provide an adequate return and render service to the communities in which the banks are located 
credit reviews and loan examinations help confirm that the banks are adhering to these loan policies 
the banks make both secured and unsecured loans to individuals  firms and corporations  and both consumer and commercial lending operations include various types of credit for the banks customers 
secured loans include first and second real estate mortgage loans 
the banks also make direct installment loans to consumers on both a secured and unsecured basis

all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is subsequently accounted for on a cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for a return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
included as other impaired loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans at december   are loans to one borrower totaling approximately  these loans are conditionally guaranteed by the u 
s 
department of agriculture 
however  these loans are considered by management to be impaired loans as defined in sfas no 
 because the loans have deteriorated to the point of loss and management is relying on the usda s guaranty to avoid further losses 
during the fourth quarter of  management charged off the unguaranteed balances and established a reserve for interest accrued but uncollected through year end 
a potential problem loan is any loan which is not disclosed above as nonperforming  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
as of december   excluding those loans classified as nonperforming  there were no significant loans that management considered as potential problem loans

the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance  or the availability of new information  could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods

the most significant of these sources of funds during was the fhlb advances  which averaged million during the advances outstanding at december  totaled million with a weighted average stated interest rate of 
for a more detailed discussion of the fhlb advances and other borrowings of pab  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of pab and affects pab s ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
assets  consisting principally of loans and investment securities  are funded by customer deposits  borrowed funds  and retained earnings 
the investment portfolio has been one of pab s primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds that are available for cash needs 
contractual investment securities that mature within one year total million 
however  mortgage backed securities and securities with call provisions create cash flows earlier than the contractual maturities 
estimates of prepayments on mortgage backed securities and call provisions on federal agency and state and municipals increase the forecasted cash flow from the investment portfolio 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds 
in addition  pab s liquidity continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable core deposit base and the availability of additional advances from the fhlb 
at december   pab s liquidity ratio was and its dependency ratio was 
pab s liquidity from investments is somewhat limited since the banks have pledged certain investments to secure public deposits  certain borrowing arrangements  and for other purposes 
at december   approximately of pab s investments were pledged as collateral to others 
the consolidated financial statements do not reflect various commitments and contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
such financial instruments are included in the financial statements when funds are distributed or the instruments become payable 
at december   the banks had outstanding commitments to extend credit through open lines of credit of approximately  and outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately  for more detailed disclosure on the commitments and contingent liabilities of pab  see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
at december   pab had outstanding commitments to complete the construction of two bank branch offices  for the installation and training costs of a new loan platform system  and for the conversion of friendship s data processing systems 
management plans to fund these expenditures  totaling approximately million  with cash provided from operations in cash flows from operations were million in stockholders equity pab maintains a ratio of stockholders equity to total assets that is adequate relative to industry standards 
pab s ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was at december   compared to at december  pab and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the fdic 
see the section titled capital adequacy under supervision and regulation in item of this document for more information on the regulatory capital adequacy standards

through the provision  pab maintains an allowance for loan losses that management believes is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the banks allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require the banks to recognize additions to their allowance for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management analyzes the allowance for loan losses  nonperforming loans  and net charge offs to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans was  compared to at december  during the fourth quarter of  management elected to make a special one time provision of million to the bank s allowance for loan losses 
uncertainties about a rapidly slowing economy and a growing loan portfolio spurred the timing of management s decision 
in addition  pab converted baxley from a federal savings bank to a state commercial bank 
in doing so  a conversion provision of  was made to bring their allowance for loan losses to that of comparable commercial banks 
before the conversion provision  baxley s allowance as a percent of total loans was 
after the conversion provision  the ratio was 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was and at december  and  respectively

the net interest margin was  which compared to fourth quarter s 
the average yield on earning assets rose from in to in  however the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased nearly a full percentage point from in to in the rise in interest expense during the period was primarily due to higher rates during the period in comparison to impact of inflation inflation impacts the growth in total assets in the banking industry and causes a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates to meet capital adequacy requirements 
pab copes with the effects of inflation through effectively managing its interest rate sensitivity gap position  by periodically reviewing and adjusting its pricing of services to consider current costs  and through managing its dividend payout policy relative to its level of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pab is exposed to us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  pab manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
pab does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
pab does not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly held pass through securities 
finally  pab has no material direct exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of pab s asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
it is pab s policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
the table below has two measures of gap  regulatory and management adjusted 
the regulatory gap considers only contractual maturities or repricings 
the management adjusted gap considers such things as prepayments on certain interest rate sensitive assets and the circumstances under which core deposits are repriced 
although interest bearing transaction accounts are available to reprice in the three month window  historical experiences show these deposits more stable over the course of one year 
the management adjusted gap indicates pab is somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
pab uses simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining  and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
as of year end  the simulation model projected net interest income would increase if rates gradually rise by basis points over the next year 
on the other hand  the model projected net interest income to decrease if rates gradually decline by basis points over the next year 
pab s policy states that net interest income cannot change over using this analysis and presently  pab is within policy guidelines
