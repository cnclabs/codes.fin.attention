item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an engineering services firm with domestic and international clients that include local  state and federal government agencies and private clients in a broad array of industries 
revenues are earned from fixed price  cost plus and time and materials contracts 
we recognize revenues by the percentage completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
the principal components of our direct operating costs are labor costs for employees who are directly involved in providing services to clients and subcontractor costs 
other direct operating expenses include those expenses associated with specific projects including materials and incidental expenditures 
indirect  general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits for management  administrative  marketing and sales personnel  bid and proposal cost  occupancy and related overhead costs 
substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations are provided in large part by distributions to or advances from our subsidiaries 
under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of the subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues in fiscal were billion  or over the amount reported in fiscal the growth in revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of d m in june in fiscal  the results of operations of d m were included for only five months versus a full year in fiscal our internal growth rate in fiscal was approximately 
direct operating expenses increased million  or over the amount reported in fiscal the increase is due to full year rather than five months of direct operating expenses of d m in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  to increases in subcontractor costs and direct labor costs 
indirect  general and administrative ig a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the addition of the d m overhead as well as an increase in business activity 
included in indirect expenses in fiscal was a million fee incurred in connection with the acquisition of d m 
in addition  there was a million reversal of a previously established reserve related to the settlement of a lawsuit in expressed as a percentage of revenues  ig a expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal we attribute this stability to cost control 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of increased borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition of d m in june with an effective income tax rate of in  we earned net income available for common stockholders of million compared to million in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was 
we earned per share on a diluted basis in fiscal compared to per share in fiscal our backlog of signed and funded contracts at october   was billion as compared to billion at october  the value of our designations was million at october   as compared to million at october  fiscal compared with fiscal revenues in fiscal were billion  or over the amount reported in fiscal the growth in revenues is primarily attributable to the acquisition of d m  the results of which are included commencing june accordingly  in fiscal  the results of operations of d m were included for only five months 
direct operating expenses increased million to million  or over the amount reported in fiscal the increase is due to the addition of the direct operating expenses of d m and to increases in subcontractor costs and direct labor costs

finally  ig a included a million reversal of a previously established reserve related to a settlement of a lawsuit 
expressed as a percentage of revenues  ig a expenses decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal we attribute this stability to cost control 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of increased borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition of d m 
with an effective income tax rate of in  we earned net income available for common stockholders of million while in net income available for common stockholders was million after an effective income tax rate of 
we earned per share on a diluted basis in fiscal compared to per share in fiscal our backlog of signed and funded contracts at october   was billion as compared to million at october  the value of our designations was million at october   as compared to million at october  income taxes we currently have million net operating loss nol carryforwards  the utilization of which is limited to  per year  pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  related to our october quasi reorganization 
this nol will expire in the fiscal year beginning we also have available million of foreign nols 
these nols are available only to offset income earned in foreign jurisdictions and expire at various dates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax liability increased primarily because of the tax deductibility of post acquisition charges to the acquisition reserves related to the acquisition of d m 
the net change in the total valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for the year ended october   was a decrease of million due to the utilization of domestic net operating losses  and an increase of million due to current year foreign losses not benefited 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had working capital of million  an increase of million from october  as a professional services organization  we are not capital intensive 
capital expenditures historically have been for computer aided design and general purpose computer equipment to accommodate our growth 
capital expenditures during fiscal years   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to have capital outlays consistent with our resulting relative growth 
substantially all of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
as a result  funds necessary to meet our debt service obligations are provided in large part by distributions to or advances from our subsidiaries 
under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions as well as the financial condition and reporting requirements of the subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from the subsidiaries 
our liquidity and capital measurements are set forth below years ended october  dollars in thousands working capital    working capital ratio to to to average days to convert billed accounts receivable to cash percentage of debt to equity during fiscal year  cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
we intend to satisfy our working capital needs primarily through internal cash generation 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and borrowings under the senior collateralized credit facility  if necessary 
our primary uses of cash are to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures and to service our debt 
we believe that our existing financial resources  together with our planned cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities  will provide sufficient resources to fund our operations and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  we paid million for the purchase of d m 
to fund this transaction and to refinance outstanding bank debt  we incurred new borrowings of million from establishing a long term senior collateralized credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by wells fargo bank  na the bank and from the issuance of the senior subordinated exchange notes 
we also issued  shares of our series b exchangeable  convertible preferred stock to rcba strategic partners  lp for an aggregate consideration of million 
the net proceeds of the debt were incurred to fund a portion of the d m acquisition and to refinance bank debt previously incurred in the acquisition of w c 
senior collateralized credit facility 
the senior collateralized credit facility was funded on june  funding date and provides for three term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of million and a revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the term loan facilities consist of term loan a  a million tranche  term loan b  a million tranche and term loan c  another million tranche 
principal amounts under term loan a became due  commencing on october   in the amount of approximately million per quarter for the subsequent four quarters 
thereafter and through the sixth anniversary of the funding date  annual principal payments under term loan a range from million to a maximum of million with term loan a expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full on june  principal amounts under term loan b became due  commencing on october   in the amount of million in each year through july   with term loan b expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full in equal quarterly installments in year seven 
principal amounts under term loan c became due  commencing on october   in the amount of million in each year through july   with term loan c expiring and the then outstanding principal amount becoming due and repayable in full in equal quarterly installments in year eight 
the revolving credit facility expires and is repayable in full on june  the term loans each bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  either the base rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  the base rate  libor or the adjusted sterling rate  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin adjusts according to a performance pricing grid based on our ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the base rate is defined as the higher of the bank s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus 
libor is defined as the offered quotation by first class banks in the london interbank market to the bank for dollar deposits  as adjusted for reserve requirements 
the adjusted sterling rate is defined as the rate per annum displayed by reuters at which sterling is offered to the bank in the london interbank market as determined by the british bankers association 
we may determine which interest rate options to use and interest periods will apply for such periods for both term loans and the revolving credit facility 
at october   our revolving credit facility with the bank provided for advances up to million 
also at october   we had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  which reduced the amount available to us under our revolving credit facility to million 
the senior collateralized credit facility is governed by affirmative and negative covenants 
these covenants include a requirement to submit quarterly compliance certifications and restrictions upon incurring additional debt  paying dividends  or making distributions to our stockholders  repurchasing or retiring capital stock  and making subordinated junior debt payments 
the financial covenants include maintenance of a minimum current ratio of to  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to  a four quarter ebitda as defined minimum of million and a maximum leverage ratio of to for the year ended october  we were fully compliant with these covenants as of october  senior subordinated notes 
our notes were originally issued as exchange notes and were exchanged in august for senior subordinated notes due each note bears interest at per annum 
interest on the notes will be payable semi annually on may and november of each year  commencing november  the notes are subordinate to the senior collateralized credit facility 
as of october   we owed million on our notes 
certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the notes on joint and several bases 
we may redeem any of the notes beginning may  the initial redemption price is of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the redemption price will decline each year after and will be of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest beginning on may  in addition  at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the principal amount of the notes with net cash proceeds from the sale of capital stock 
the redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the redeemed notes 
interest rate swap agreement 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the bank 
this agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on million of our libor based borrowings at plus the applicable margin through november  the actual borrowing cost to us with respect to indebtedness covered by the interest rate swap will depend upon the applicable margin over libor for such indebtedness  which will be determined by the terms of the relevant debt instruments 
currently  it is expected that the contractual margin will range from to  which will provide for an all in annual interest rate range from to 
interest rate cap agreement 
we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with the bank 
this agreement caps our interest rate at for million of our libor based borrowings through july   and is in addition to the interest rate swap agreement stated above

in thousands purchase price of d m net of debt  acquisition costs net of financing fees  fair value of assets acquired  incremental additional excess purchase price over net assets acquired  d m historical goodwill  net  aggregate goodwill  during the year ended october   we provided for million of costs in connection with the acquisition of d m and our reorganization plans to integrate d m s operations 
these costs consist of project claims and cost over runs  lease fees  severance and miscellaneous items 
the following table summarizes the activity in the merger related accruals during the year ended october  relating to the d m acquisition 
balance balance october  payments october  in millions project claims severance and related costs lease termination fees and project cost over runs miscellaneous expenses total during the year ended october   we provided for million of costs related to the acquisition of w c and our reorganization plans to integrate w c s operations 
these costs consist of project claims  lease fees  severance and miscellaneous items 
the following table summarizes the activity in the merger related accruals during the year ended october  relating to the w c acquisition 
balance balance october  payments october  in millions project claims lease termination fees total risk factors that could affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form k  the following factors could affect our actual results our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we are a highly leveraged company 
as of october   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness following consummation of the d m acquisition and the related financing plan 
this level of indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following o it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  o it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  o we could be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  o it may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy  and o a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and would not be available for other purposes 
to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash 
the ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service and working capital requirements  we may need to seek additional financing or sell assets 
this need may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
without this financing  we could be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances 
our senior collateralized credit facility and our obligations under the notes limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from any such sale 
moreover  the senior collateralized credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
furthermore  substantial portions of our assets are  and may continue to be  intangible assets 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our assets could be sold quickly enough or for sufficient amounts to enable us to meet our debt obligations 
restrictive covenants in our senior collateralized credit facility and the indenture relating to the notes may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies 
our senior collateralized credit facility and indenture relating to the notes restrict our ability  among other things  to o incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations  o pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  o repurchase or redeem our stock  o make investments  o grant liens  o make capital expenditures  o enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  o sell assets  and o acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies 
in addition  our senior collateralized credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we may not be able to maintain these ratios 
additionally  covenants in the senior collateralized credit facility and the indenture relating to the notes may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other favorable business activities 
if we default under our various debt obligations  the lenders could require immediate repayment of the entire principal 
if the lenders require immediate repayment  we will not be able to repay them  and our inability to meet our debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive approximately of our revenues from contracts with government agencies 
any disruption in government funding or in our relationship with those agencies could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our debt obligations 
we derive approximately of our revenues from local  state and federal government agencies 
the demand for our services will be directly related to the level of government program funding that is allocated to rebuild and expand the nation s infrastructure 
we believe that the success and further development of our business depend upon the continued funding of these government programs and upon our ability to participate in these government programs 
we cannot assure you that governments will have the available resources to fund these programs  that these programs will continue to be funded even if governments have available financial resources  or that we will continue to win government contracts under these or other programs 
some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually  so we cannot assure you of our continued work under these contracts in the future 
unsuccessful bidders may protest or challenge the award of these contracts 
in addition  government agencies can terminate these contracts at their convenience 
consequently  we may incur costs in connection with the termination of these contracts 
also  contracts with government agencies are subject to substantial regulation and an audit of actual costs incurred 
consequently  there may be a downward adjustment in our revenues if actual recoverable costs exceed billed recoverable costs 
we must maintain our present responsibility to be eligible to perform government contracts 
from time to time allegations of improper conduct in connection with government contracting have been made against us and these could be the subject of suspension or debarment consideration 
we investigate all such allegations thoroughly and believe that appropriate actions have been taken in all cases 
additionally  we maintain a compliance program in an effort to assure that no improper conduct occurs in connection with government contracting 
we may be unable to estimate accurately our cost in performing services for our clients 
this may cause us to have low profit margins or incur losses 
we submit proposals on projects with an estimate of the costs that we will likely incur 
to the extent we cannot control overhead  general and administrative and other costs  or if we underestimate such costs  we may have low profit margins or may incur losses 
we are subject to risks from changes in environmental legislation  regulation and governmental policies 
federal laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  cercla  and various state and local laws strictly regulate the handling  removal  treatment and transportation of toxic and hazardous substances and impose liability for environmental contamination caused by such substances 
moreover  so called toxic tort litigation has increased markedly in recent years as people injured by hazardous substances seek recovery for personal injuries or property damage 
we handle  remove  treat and transport toxic or hazardous substances 
consequently  we may be exposed to claims for damages caused by environmental contamination 
federal and state laws  regulations  and programs related to environmental issues will generate  either directly or indirectly  much of our environmental business 
accordingly  a reduction of these laws and regulations  or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding  implementation or enforcement of these programs  could have a material effect on our business 
environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies remained essentially unchanged during fiscal year  including further deferral of congressional reauthorization of cercla 
the outlook for congressional action on cercla legislation in fiscal year remains unclear 
our liability for damages due to legal proceedings may be significant 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover this risk 
various legal proceedings are pending against us alleging  among other things  breaches of contract or negligence in connection with our performance of professional services 
in some actions punitive or treble damages are sought that substantially exceed our insurance coverage 
if we sustain damages greater than our insurance coverage  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our engineering practices  including general engineering and civil engineering services  involve professional judgments about the nature of soil conditions and other physical conditions  including the extent to which toxic and hazardous materials are present and the probable effect of procedures to mitigate problems or otherwise affect those conditions 
if the judgments and the recommendations based upon those judgments are incorrect  we may be liable for resulting damages that our clients incur 
the failure to attract and retain key professional personnel could adversely affect our business 
the ability to attract  retain and expand our staff of qualified technical professionals will be an important factor in determining our future success 
a shortage of qualified technical professionals currently exists in the engineering and design industry 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to continue to attract and retain such professionals 
in addition  we will rely heavily upon the experience and ability of our senior executive staff and the loss of a significant number of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to compete successfully in our industry 
we are engaged in highly fragmented and very competitive markets in our service areas 
we will compete with firms of various sizes  several of which are substantially larger than us and possess greater technical resources 
furthermore  the engineering and design industry is undergoing consolidation  particularly in the united states 
as a result  we will compete against several larger companies that have the ability to offer more diverse services to a wider client base 
these competitive forces could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks that could adversely affect the results from these operations and our overall business 
as a worldwide provider of engineering services  we have operations in over countries and derive approximately of our revenues from international operations 
international business is subject to the customary risks associated with international transactions  including political risks  local laws and taxes  the potential imposition of trade or currency exchange restrictions  tariff increases and difficulties or delays in collecting accounts receivable 
weak foreign economies and or a weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additional acquisitions may adversely affect our ability to manage our business 
historically  we have completed numerous acquisitions and  in implementing our business strategy  we may continue to do so in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will identify  finance and complete additional suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms 
we may not successfully integrate future acquisitions 
any acquisitions may require substantial attention from our management  which may limit the amount of time that management can devote to daily operations 
our inability to find additional attractive acquisition candidates or to effectively manage the integration of any businesses acquired in the future could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowings under our senior collateralized credit facility 
if market rates average more in fiscal year than in fiscal year  our net of tax interest expense  after considering the effect of the interest rate cap agreement  would increase by approximately million 
conversely  if market rates average less in fiscal year than in fiscal year  our net of tax interest expense would decrease by approximately million 
the final interest rate settlement for our interest rate swap agreement had been determined prior to the close of fiscal year therefore  changes in interest rates will not be impacted by our then existing interest rate swap agreement  which expired on november
