revenue change change revenue   revenue is categorized into four major operating segments web publishing  cross media publishing  epaper solutions  and oem postscript and other 
the web publishing  cross media publishing  and epaper solutions segments include application products revenue that is derived predominantly from shipments of application software programs marketed through retail  var  and oem distribution channels  as well as direct to end users through adobe call centers and our web site 
the oem postscript and other segment includes licensing revenue  which is made up of royalties received from oem partners who ship products containing adobe s postscript technology  and includes revenue from divested businesses 
revenue from our web publishing segment is derived primarily from the licensing of the following application products adobe photoshop  adobe premiere  after effects  golive  adobe photodeluxe  adobe web collection  adobe dynamic media collection  pagemill  livemotion formerly imagestyler  and activeshare 
cross media publishing revenue comes primarily from the licensing of the following application products adobe illustrator  pagemaker  indesign  framemaker  adobe publishing collection  adobe design collection  adobe type manager  adobe type library  pressready  adobe font folio  incopy  acrobat inproduction  adobe dimensions  and streamline 
the epaper solutions segment is derived from the licensing of adobe acrobat software and other acrobat related technologies 
for further information regarding our operating segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  overall revenue increased compared to fiscal  driven primarily by increased licensing of products in our web publishing  epaper solutions  and cross media publishing segments 
our web publishing segment provided the majority of the revenue growth in fiscal  as it grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from this segment was primarily driven by the strength of photoshop revenue during the first three quarters of fiscal and the release of our photoshop product in the fourth quarter of fiscal also contributing to the growth in this segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the increased revenue from our web and dynamic media collection products  which were first introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increased licensing of our livemotion  adobe premiere  after effects  golive  and activeshare products 
the increase in revenue in this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our pagemill and photodeluxe products  due to product lifecycle timing and pricing 
revenue from our epaper solutions segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the continuing penetration of acrobat and its related technologies into major industry sectors and various government agencies 
revenue from our cross media publishing segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the new release of illustrator in the third quarter of fiscal this segment also benefited from the new release of framemaker in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as increased revenue from our adobe design collection  adobe type manager  acrobat inproduction  and pressready products 
the increase in revenue from this segment was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our adobe publishing collection product  primarily due to the introduction of our new adobe web  dynamic media  and design collection products  and a decline in revenue in both indesign  due to slower adoption of this product in fiscal compared to the adoption upon the initial release of this product in fiscal  and pagemaker  due to product lifecycle timing 
the increase in revenue from the above mentioned segments in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our oem postscript and other segment  as it decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue from this segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower royalty rates paid by our oems and the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors loss of royalty revenue from hewlett packard company s hp desktop monochrome laser printer division  which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript software into its products since the fall of  a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers  and an increase in the use of inkjet printers  resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market 
although we experienced better than expected results in fiscal due to the strength of the high end color and digital copier markets  we expect our oem postscript license business to decline approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  overall revenue increased compared to fiscal  due to increased licensing of products in the cross media publishing  epaper solutions  and web publishing segments 
excluding revenue from businesses divested in the third quarter of fiscal  revenue increased 
the cross media publishing segment provided the majority of the fiscal revenue growth  with a increase from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from this segment was primarily due to increased licensing of our adobe publishing collection product and the introduction of indesign in the second half of fiscal the increase in revenue from these products was partially offset by a decline in revenue from pagemaker  illustrator  and framemaker  primarily due to product lifecycle timing 
additional revenue growth in fiscal was achieved through our epaper solutions segment  as revenue more than doubled compared to fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to the release of acrobat in the second quarter of fiscal  with a higher number of units licensed as a result of growing customer adoption of adobe acrobat and adobe portable document format pdf technology 
the web publishing segment also contributed to the revenue growth  as it grew in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the new release of our golive product and increased licensing of our photoshop  after effects  and adobe premiere products 
in addition  this segment experienced increased revenue from our adobe web collection and adobe dynamic media collection products 
the increase in revenue from this segment in fiscal was partially offset by a decline in revenue from our adobe photodeluxe product  due to reduced pricing  and a decline in revenue from our pagemill product  due to product lifecycle timing 
the increase in revenue in fiscal in the above operating segments was partially offset by a decline in revenue from the oem postscript and other segment of million  or  compared to fiscal oem postscript licensing revenue experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the following factors loss of royalty revenue from hp s desktop monochrome laser printer division  which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript software into its products since the fall of  a decline in the average selling price of monochrome laser printers  and an increase in the use of inkjet printers  resulting in weakness in the monochrome laser printer market 
in addition  in fiscal  we received million in revenue in this segment from businesses we divested in the third quarter of fiscal  resulting in a decline of revenue in fiscal from the absence of these businesses 
we categorize our geographic information into three major market regions the americas  emea  and asia 
in fiscal and fiscal  revenue generated in the americas  emea  and asia represented   and of total revenue  respectively 
overall  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform increased by in fiscal over fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenue from our application products on the windows platform increased  and revenue from our application products on the macintosh platform increased during the same period 
in fiscal  the windows and macintosh platforms accounted for and  respectively  of application products revenue  excluding platform independent and unix products  compared to and  respectively  in both fiscal and fiscal we expect the trend towards the windows platform to continue in the foreseeable future 
direct costs change change direct costs percentage of total revenue direct costs include product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  and amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies 
direct costs decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower localization and royalty costs  as well as a reduction in material costs as a result of our ongoing cost improvement program 
direct costs also decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to more effective inventory management  resulting in lower excess and obsolete inventory and lower material costs 
for fiscal  we anticipate that gross margin will be approximately of revenue 
operating expenses research and development change change research and development percentage of total revenue research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs  and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher incentive compensation expenses associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over fiscal and higher salaries as a result of headcount growth 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to higher incentive compensation expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in salaries as a result of lower headcount and decreases in general office expenses and professional fees as a result of our fiscal restructuring program and other cost reduction efforts implemented at that time 
we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to make significant investments in the development of our application software products  including those targeted for the growing internet market 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal we are targeting research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal to be of revenue 
for the remainder of fiscal  we are targeting research and development expenses to be of revenue 
sales and marketing change change sales and marketing percentage of total revenue sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits  sales commissions  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for our sales  marketing  customer support  and distribution personnel 
sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows  public relations  and other market development programs 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses and higher outsourced technical support and order management fees 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to our focus on general corporate brand advertising  as well as higher marketing  public relations  and trade show activities associated with new product releases 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation  advertising  promotional  and trade show expenses 
the increase was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives related to the restructuring program implemented during the third quarter of fiscal that eliminated certain brand advertising campaigns and other marketing activities related to a divested business 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support investments in e business and enhanced marketing activities 
for the first quarter of fiscal  our sales and marketing expense target is approximately of revenue 
for the remainder of fiscal  we are targeting sales and marketing expenses to be approximately of revenue 
general and administrative change change general and administrative percentage of total revenue general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  and related facilities costs for the finance  human resources  legal  information services  and executive personnel of adobe 
general and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees  provision for bad debts  and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher salaries as a result of increased headcount  and higher bad debt expense and legal fees 
the increase was partially offset by decreases in professional fees and depreciation expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the savings related to the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal and additionally  the decrease is attributable to decreased legal fees and lower bad debt expense 
these decreases were offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense primarily associated with the improvement in our financial performance in fiscal over the prior year and higher incentive compensation targets 
we expect that general and administrative spending will slightly increase in absolute dollars in fiscal to support ongoing administrative infrastructure needs 
we have targeted such expenditures to be approximately of revenue in fiscal restructuring and other charges change change restructuring and other charges percentage of total revenue in fiscal  restructuring and other charges consisted of million of other charges relating to the disposal of certain equipment and one time litigation related expenses  and a credit of million related to the fiscal and fiscal restructuring programs 
the million credit was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  as we revised our estimates of the total costs associated with the fiscal and restructuring programs 
the credit primarily reflected lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within adobe 
the remaining credit was due to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
for detailed information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal and  we implemented three different board approved restructuring programs 
these separate restructuring programs were directly focused on improving our competitive position as well as enhancing adobe s allocation of resources 
the two fiscal restructuring programs resulted in total charges of approximately million  which included severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force and charges for vacating leased facilities 
during fiscal  we revised our estimate of the total costs associated with the restructuring programs implemented during the year  resulting in an adjustment to the restructuring accrual of approximately million 
the adjustment was due to lower than estimated severance and related charges attributable to employees whose positions were eliminated as a result of the restructurings but who were able to find alternative employment within adobe  and to lower than expected charges related to vacating leased facilities 
in addition  we recorded adjustments during fiscal related to prior year restructuring programs in the amount of million 
the million adjustment was primarily due to both our success in terminating a lease agreement earlier than the contract term specified and the expiration of other lease termination costs for two facilities 
other charges recorded in fiscal of million included million associated with the cancelation of a contract and million for accelerated depreciation related to the adjustment of the useful life of certain assets as a result of decisions made by management as part of the restructuring program 
additionally  we incurred a nonrecurring compensation charge totaling million for a terminated employee and incurred consulting fees of million to assist in the restructuring of our operations 
the restructuring program was implemented to refocus our product development efforts and to eliminate management redundancies in the organization 
in connection with this restructuring program  we recorded million in restructuring charges  related to severance and related charges associated with the reduction in force  as well as the divestiture of two business units  charges for vacating leased facilities  and the cancelation of certain contracts 
as of december  no obligations existed related to the fiscal and restructuring programs 
acquired in process research and development change change acquired in process research and development na percentage of total revenue in fiscal  we recorded million of acquired in process research and development related to our acquisition of glassbook  inc glassbook 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb 
based on an independent appraiser s valuation  million of the total million purchase price was allocated to in process research and development due to the state of the development and the uncertainty of the technology 
acquired in process research and development of million in fiscal is comprised of million and million associated with the acquisitions of attitude software  llc attitude software and photomerge technology photomerge  respectively 
the following is a summary of the projects acquired in the acquisitions and the assumptions used in determining the value of the in process research and development costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets  consisting of intellectual property  of attitude software 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with apb  and substantially all of the purchase price of million cash was allocated to in process research and development and expensed at the time of acquisition 
the ongoing project at attitude software at the time of the purchase included the development of the d anarchy authoring product 
we purchased this technology to incorporate it into future versions of our existing adobe products to further enhance the feature sets and user interface contained within the products 
at the date we acquired attitude software  it was estimated that of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately months to complete and would cost million 
the efforts required to complete the development of the technology primarily related to additional design efforts to integrate the technology into several of adobe s products  finalization of coding  and completion testing 
the value of the in process technology was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products the technology would be integrated into  including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products  excluding the value attributed to the existing technology with the products prior to the integration of the purchased technology 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of  exclusive of the value attributable to the use of the in process technologies in future products 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets  consisting of intellectual property  of photomerge 
in connection with the acquisition of photomerge  of the purchase price  or  cash  was allocated to in process research and development due to the state of completion and the uncertainty of the technology 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles change change amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles percentage of total revenue amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in fiscal and primarily related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of golive systems  inc and a related partnership together golive systems in december amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the additional amortization related to the acquisition of glassbook in september for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating income investment gain change change investment gain percentage of total revenue investment gain consists principally of realized gains or losses from direct investments as well as mark to market valuation adjustments for investments held by adobe incentive partners  lp aip 
during fiscal  we recorded investment gains related to the sale of a portion of our investment in tumbleweed communications corp 
tumbleweed and digimarc corporation for million and million  respectively 
additionally  we recorded investment gains related to the mark to market valuation adjustment for avantgo  inc totaling million and other net gains related to various other adobe ventures investments activities totaling approximately million 
these gains were partially offset by investment losses related to the write down of our investments in engage  inc  ecircles  inc  salon 
com  and impresse corporation  totaling approximately million 
in fiscal  we recorded a realized gain of million related to the sale of our investment in vignette corporation 
we also recorded investment gains from mark to market adjustments totaling million  million  and million related to investments in esps  inc  digitalthink  inc  and tumbleweed  respectively 
these gains were partially offset by an investment loss of million related to the acquisition of pointcast  inc  a former investee of adobe  by idealab s launchpad technologies  inc idealab 
in connection with the acquisition  we exchanged our shares of pointcast  inc for approximately  shares of idealab which has since become infogate  inc 
additionally  we recorded a net gain totaling million related to mark to market adjustments of various other adobe ventures investments 
in fiscal  we recorded a realized gain of million related to our investment in mcqueen international limited mcqueen  due to the acquisition of mcqueen by sykes enterprises  incorporated  a publicly traded company 
in addition  we liquidated our investment in siebel systems  incorporated siebel through the distribution to our stockholders of approximately  shares of siebel common stock as a dividend in kind and the sale of our remaining siebel shares 
a gain of approximately million was recognized on the transaction 
the remaining net realized gain recorded in fiscal represents valuation adjustments related to our venture investments held by aip 
we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon the operations of the underlying investee companies 
interest and other income change change interest and other income percentage of total revenue interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and realized gains or losses on the disposal of assets 
interest and other income decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of more investments being made in tax exempt securities  resulting in lower interest income on a comparative pretax basis 
in fiscal  we also recorded foreign exchange transaction losses compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in fiscal in addition  other income was lower in fiscal  as fiscal included a million gain related to the sale of a corporate facility in edinburgh  scotland  in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower average cash and short term investment balances  primarily as a result of cash used for stock repurchases 
in addition  during fiscal more investments were made in tax exempt securities 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal was partially offset by a million gain realized from the sale of a corporate facility in edinburgh  scotland  in connection with the restructuring program announced in the second quarter of fiscal we expect interest and other income to be approximately million per quarter in fiscal we expect interest income to increase slightly in fiscal  even though we plan to continue to repurchase stock under our share repurchase program 
however  we believe that the increase in interest income may be offset by foreign currency charges for purchased options and market price volatility under our implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
further  our cash balances could also be reduced in fiscal due to the purchase of software companies  products  or technologies that are complementary to our business 
income tax provision change change income tax provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal  due to tax benefits associated with the restructuring of our international operations 
our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in nondeductible goodwill amortization 
we have targeted our effective tax rate to decrease in fiscal to approximately 
factors that may affect future results of operations we believe that in the future our results of operations could be affected by various factors  including delays in shipment of our new products and major new versions of existing products lack of market acceptance of new products and upgrades adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business  including the recent slow down affecting the us and other geographic areas introduction of new products by major competitors weakness in demand for application software and printers lack of growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and downward sales price adjustments renegotiation of royalty arrangements consolidation in the oem printer business ongoing weakness in our printing business due to product transitions industry transitions to new business and information delivery models market risks associated with our equity investments as discussed later under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have stated that we are targeting at least annual revenue growth in fiscal additionally  for fiscal we have stated the following operating model targets gross margin of  operating profit margin of  and general and administrative expenses at of revenue 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we have stated operating model targets for research and development expenses of of revenue and sales and marketing expenses of of revenue  and for the remainder of fiscal  research and development expenses of of revenue and sales and marketing expenses of of revenue 
we have also stated that we expect our share count to increase three to four million per quarter in fiscal  that interest income is expected to be approximately million per quarter in fiscal  and that we plan to hire  employees in fiscal however  our headcount increases will not reach this initially planned level due to adjustments in light of the recent slow down in some geographic areas 
finally  we have stated an effective tax rate target for fiscal of and a days sales outstanding dso target range of days 
we use these targets to assist us in making decisions about our allocation of resources and investments  not as predictions of future results 
the targets reflect a number of assumptions  including assumptions about product pricing and demand manufacturing costs and volumes the mix of application products and licensing revenue  full and upgrade products  distribution channels  and geographic distribution substantial headcount increases these and many other factors described in this report affect our financial performance and may cause our future results  including results for the current quarter  to vary materially from these targets 
in particular  the recent slow down in some geographic areas  primarily in the us  has affected all of our product segments and may adversely affect our ability to achieve our revenue target 
the slow down has also affected our hiring plans  we may hire significantly fewer than  employees during fiscal in light of this factor 
our ability to develop and market products  including upgrades of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs  may also have an impact on our results of operations 
our ability to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes could affect our ability to develop these products 
a portion of our future revenue will come from these new applications 
delays in product or upgrade introductions could cause a decline in our revenue  earnings  or stock price 
we cannot determine the ultimate effect that these new products or upgrades will have on our revenue or results of operations 
the market for our graphics applications  particularly our web publishing and consumer products  is intensely and increasingly competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry competitors 
additionally  microsoft has increased its presence in the digital imaging graphics market  we believe that  due to microsoft s market dominance  any new microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with our products 
if competing new products achieve widespread acceptance  our operating results would suffer 
we generally offer our application based products on macintosh  windows  and unix platforms  and we generally offer our server based products on the linux platform as well as these three platforms 
to the extent that there is a slow down of customer purchases of personal computers on either the windows or macintosh platform or in general  our business could be harmed 
we distribute our application products primarily through distributors  resellers  and retailers collectively referred to as distributors 
a significant amount of our revenue for application products is from two distributors 
we have revised our channel program to reduce the overall number of our distributors worldwide and focus our channel efforts on larger distributors 
this revision of the channel program has resulted in an increase in our dependence on a smaller number of distributors selling through a larger amount of our products 
additionally  our goal is to increase our direct distribution of our products to end users through our online store located on our web site at www 
adobe 
com 
any such increase in our direct revenue efforts will place us in increased competition with our channel distributors and with newer types of distribution of our products by online  internet based resellers of our products 
while we anticipate that the restructuring and streamlining of our product distribution channels and the increase in the scope of our direct sales efforts will eventually improve our business by decreasing discounts or rebate programs provided to distributors  decreasing product returns  and shortening inventory cycles  these changes could instead seriously harm our business 
in addition  we continue to expand into third party distribution channels  including vars and systems integrators  in our effort to further broaden our customer base 
as a result  the financial health of these third parties and our continuing relationships with them are becoming more important to our success 
some of these companies are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business conditions 
our business could be seriously harmed if the financial condition of some of these third parties substantially weakens or if our relationships with them deteriorate 
also  as we seek to further broaden our customer base in the corporate business and consumer markets  we may not successfully adapt our application software distribution channels  which could cause our operating results to suffer 
we could experience decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in our distribution channels that could seriously harm our business 
we currently rely on three manufacturers of our products  each located in a different region 
if a manufacturer terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a manufacturer is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  we may not have enough time or be able to replace the supply of products manufactured by that manufacturer to avoid harm to our business 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment experienced a decline in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decline in revenue from the licensing of adobe postscript technology 
we expect this trend to continue  with this revenue declining a further during fiscal from fiscal  and we believe that our financial results could be harmed if it decreases further 
the ongoing weakness in the monochrome laser printer market as a result of the decline in average selling prices of monochrome laser printers and the increasing use of inkjet printers was a factor causing the revenue decline 
in addition  the loss of royalty revenue from hp s desktop monochrome laser printer division  which has been incorporating a clone version of adobe postscript technology in some printers  has resulted in lower licensing revenue to us over the past three years 
even though we continue to work with hp printer operations to incorporate adobe postscript and other technologies into other hp products  we expect continued lower revenue in this segment from hp 
if other significant partners also decide to incorporate a clone version instead of adobe postscript technology  it could seriously harm our business 
further  oem partners on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements 
we evaluate these requests on a case by case basis 
if an agreement is not reached  a customer may decide to pursue other options  which could result in lower licensing revenue for us 
we are currently experiencing a slow down in certain geographic market areas  primarily in the us we attribute this slow down  which is affecting all of our product segments  to weakening economic conditions 
in addition  from the end of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a decline in revenue from the japanese market due to a weak japanese computer market and general economic conditions in japan 
although revenue from our japanese operation has increased since that time  these adverse economic conditions in the us and other geographic markets may continue in the short term  and they may continue to adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
although there were also adverse conditions in other countries  the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of our revenue and thus have less impact on our operational results 
although we implemented two restructurings of our business during fiscal  resulting in a collective workforce reduction of  we plan to continue to invest in certain areas  which will require us to hire a significant number of additional employees 
competition for high quality personnel  especially highly skilled engineers  is extremely intense 
our ability to effectively manage this growth will require us to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and information management systems  and to attract  retain  motivate  and manage employees effectively  otherwise our business could be seriously harmed 
the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products addressing authoring and communication over the internet 
as is typical in the case of a new and evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the software industry addressing authoring and communications over the internet is still developing 
standards defining web graphics have not yet been finally adopted 
in addition  new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new information delivery practices 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet including security  reliability  ease of use and access  cost  and quality of service remain unresolved and may affect the growth of internet use  together with the software standards and electronic media employed in such markets 
we have stated that we intend to increase our investment in e business and enhanced marketing activities in an effort to achieve revenue growth  but we can provide no assurance that increased investment in this new market will result in increased revenue 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue and operating income from our customers located in europe  japan  asia pacific  and latin america 
we generally experience lower revenue from our european operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their purchasing activities in the summer months 
additionally  we are uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in the asia pacific and latin america markets will continue in the foreseeable future due to possible currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions 
while most of the revenue of our european subsidiaries has in the past been denominated in us dollars  in the first quarter of fiscal we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain european countries 
in addition  the majority of our revenue derived from japan is denominated in yen  and the majority of all our subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the financial impact of such fluctuations has not been significant 
our hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks  based on our best judgment of the appropriate trade offs among risk  opportunity  and expense 
we have established a hedging program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily of the japanese yen and the euro 
we are currently reviewing our hedging program and will make adjustments based on our best judgment 
our hedging program is not comprehensive  and our program may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
in connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights or in connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third party rights  we have been  are currently  and may in the future be subject to complex  protracted litigation as part of our policy to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property litigation is typically very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel 
although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation  we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation 
adverse decisions in such litigation could have negative results  including subjecting us to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek licenses from others  preventing us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products  or causing severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa  the securities and exchange commission the sec  and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
accounting policies affecting many other aspects of our business  including rules relating to software revenue recognition purchase and pooling of interests accounting for business combinations the valuation of in process research and development employee stock purchase plans stock option grants goodwill amortization have recently been revised or are under review by one or more of these groups 
changes to these rules or the questioning of current practices may have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results or in the way in which we conduct our business 
due to the factors noted earlier  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in revenue or earnings  or any delay in the release of any product or upgrade  compared to analysts or investors expectations could cause  and has caused in the past  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
additionally  we may not learn of such shortfalls or delays until late in the fiscal quarter  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
finally  we participate in a highly dynamic industry 
in addition to factors specific to us  changes in analysts earnings estimates for us or our industry and factors affecting the corporate environment  our industry  or the securities markets in general will often result in significant volatility of our common stock price

liquidity and capital resources change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consist principally of money market mutual funds  municipal bonds  united states government agency securities  and marketable equity securities 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased million  or  in fiscal  primarily due to cash generated from operations of million and proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock related to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans and sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million 
other sources of cash include the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the sale of a building in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  short term investments increased due to a reclassification of million of investments previously classified as long term to short term 
these increases were partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock in the amount of million  the purchase of long term investments and other assets for million  the purchase of glassbook for million  capital expenditures of million  and the payment of dividends totaling million 
in addition  our short term investments decreased as a result of mark to market adjustments totaling million  the write down of certain short term marketable equity investments totaling million  and the sale of marketable equity investments with a cost basis of million 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including expenditures for computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to purchase treasury stock and acquire software companies  products  or technologies that are complementary to our business 
under our existing plan to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock plans  we repurchased approximately million  million  and million shares in fiscal   and  respectively  at a cost of million  million  and million  respectively 
in april  adobe s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the purchase of up to an additional million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
this new stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program whereby we have been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
no purchases have been made under the million share repurchase program 
in september  adobe s board of directors authorized  subject to certain business and market conditions  the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock over a two year period 
this program was completed in the first quarter of fiscal under this program  we repurchased approximately million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal  at a cost of million  million  and million  respectively 
we have paid cash dividends on our common stock each quarter since the second quarter of fiscal adobe s board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of per common share for each of the four quarters in fiscal   and the declaration of future dividends  whether in cash or in kind  is within the discretion of adobe s board of directors and will depend on business conditions  our results of operations and financial condition  and other factors 
to facilitate our stock repurchase program  we sold put warrants in a series of private placements in fiscal   and each put warrant entitles the holder to sell one share of our common stock to us at a specified price 
approximately million  million  and million put warrants were written in fiscal   and  respectively 
at december   approximately million put warrants were outstanding that expire on various dates through july and have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
in addition  in fiscal   and  we purchased call options that entitle us to buy million  million  and million shares  respectively  of our common stock 
at december   approximately million call options were outstanding that expire on various dates through april and have exercise prices ranging from to per share  with an average exercise price of per share 
our put and call option contracts provide that we  at our option  can settle with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the value of the option as determined by the contract 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
commitments our principal commitments as of december  consisted of obligations under operating leases  line of credit agreements  venture investing activities  and various service agreements 
in august  we entered into an operating lease agreement for two corporate headquarters office facilities in san jose  california 
the lease is for a period of five years and is subject to standard covenants including financial ratios 
we have an option to purchase the buildings at any time during the term for an amount equal to the total investment of the lessor 
at the end of the lease term  we may exercise the purchase option or  with the mutual agreement of the lessor  renew the term of the lease 
in addition to these possibilities  at the end of the term  we may elect to have the buildings sold to an unrelated third party 
in such case  we are obligated to use our best efforts to arrange for such a sale and are obligated to pay the lessor the difference between the total investment in the buildings and the net sales proceeds  provided  however  that in no event would we be required to pay more than a maximum guaranteed residual amount as set forth in the lease 
in the event we default during the term of the lease  the lessor could require us to purchase the buildings for an amount equal to our option price 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
in august  we entered into a million unsecured revolving line of credit with a group of banks for general corporate purposes  subject to certain financial covenants 
one half of the facility expired in august  and the other million expires in august we renewed  for one year  the million unsecured revolving line of credit that expired in august outstanding balances accrue interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that is based on our financial ratios 
the terms  covenants  and margins of the new facility are substantially the same as the expired facility 
there were no outstanding balances on either credit facility as of december  in addition  as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we believe that if either or both of the lines of credit are canceled or amounts are not available under the lines  it would not substantially harm our financial results  liquidity  or capital resources 
under the terms of the lines of credit and the lease agreement  we may pay cash dividends unless an event of default has occurred or we do not meet certain financial ratios 
derivatives and financial instruments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries and japan 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated licenses in japan and local currency denominated operating expenses in europe  where we license primarily in us dollars 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain european countries 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen denominated licenses in japan 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased options 
at december   total outstanding contracts included million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts and purchased put option contracts with a notional value of million 
all contracts expire at various times through march our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
an increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
we recognize gains and losses associated with the mark to market of outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  as other income in the current period 
corresponding gains and losses on the foreign currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized as other income in that same period 
in this manner  the gains and losses on foreign currency denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency contracts 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we began to denominate revenue in euros in certain european countries 
as a rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in europe where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries the local currency revenue from product upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge european currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of equity securities 
as of december   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the prices of these securities could experience adverse changes in the near term 
for example  as a result of recent market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments  we experienced a million after tax unrealized gain during the third quarter of fiscal and a million after tax unrealized loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal on these investments 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate the economic viability of these publicly traded companies  which includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash positions  revenue models  stock price activity over the past six months  and future prospects 
if we believe that an other than temporary impairment exists in one of our equity investments in these publicly traded companies  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value on the last day of our reporting period 
in addition  we have investments in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose a substantial part of or our entire initial investment in these companies 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our public equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
stock price fluctuations of minus   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
potential decrease to the value of securities given x decrease in each stock s price fair value as of december  corporate equities we also have a policy to hedge a certain portion of our equity holdings in publicly traded companies 
from time to time  we have entered into forward contracts to sell portions of our equity holdings in future periods 
these forward contracts are accounted for at fair market value offsetting changes in the value of the equities being hedged 
as of december   the value of our forward contracts hedging equity securities was million 
an increase decrease in the market value of the underlying equities will result in a corresponding decrease increase in the value of the forward contract 
the following table represents the potential decrease to the value of the forward contracts given a percentage change in the underlying equities 
potential decrease to the value of the forward contracts given x increase in the stock price of the underlying equities fair value as of december  forward contracts fixed income investments at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the market value changes for a   or basis point increase in short term treasury security yields were not material due to the limited duration of our portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to one issue  issuer  as well as the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  we do not expect the exposure to market and credit risk to be material 
facility leases we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases of our facilities whose payments are tied to the libor and have evaluated the hypothetical changes in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the libor 
market changes reflected immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the libor curve of plus or minus   and basis points for a twelve month period 
based on this analysis  such charges would not be material to our results of operations or financial position
