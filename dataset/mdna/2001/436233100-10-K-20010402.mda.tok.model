the company considers its business to be somewhat seasonal and expects net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for its tekno books book licensing and packaging operation as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
in addition  although not seasonal  the company s intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience significant fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the significant amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
while certain of the development costs are incurred as normal recurring operating expenses  the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis
