at year end  the allowance for loan losses  at million  represented a coverage ratio allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans of 
both of these totals  the allowance and the coverage ratio  were higher than at year end sale of credit card portfolio and servicing business for several years the company has serviced its own credit card portfolio as well as the credit card portfolios for several small financial institutions 
in  the company determined that it would no longer engage in the consumer credit card servicing business and that it would sell the business as well as its existing consumer credit card balances to mbna america bank  na  an organization widely recognized as an industry leader 
the decision to discontinue this activity was driven by the fact that the consumer credit card business  including both card issuance and account servicing  has increasingly become a commodity operation that requires great scale 
management also expected that its credit card customers would receive a broader array of account benefits and service under mbna s programs 
the sale  which generated a one time nonrecurring net gain of net of tax  was completed in the third quarter of the company will continue to manage its merchant credit card and debit card programs 
management does not expect that the sale of its credit card balances and discontinuation of credit card computer processing services to other correspondent banks will have a material effect on recurring future earnings 
b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  presents the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and costs paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of earning assets and the net interest margin

analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents recent changes key interest rate changes federal discount funds prime date rate rate rate january  january  may  march  february  november  august  june  november  october  september  march  the company s net interest income  for the past several years  has been sensitive to increases in interest rates 
as indicated in the table above  prevailing interest rates economy wide began to increase in the second half of through the second half of this marked a turnaround from a long period of flat or slowly declining prevailing interest rates 
the rate hikes had a moderate impact on the company s financial results for  which continued to show decreases from prior periods in the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on earning liabilities  as well as the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
however  the full impact of rising rates was the primary cause of the decrease in net interest income due to rates in the net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points from the margin for the net interest spread between the two years decreased by basis points 
the decrease in margin and spread was attributable to three main factors i generally  was a period of rising interest rates  and the cost of the company s paying liabilities increased at a faster rate than the yield on the company s earning assets 
ii the company continued to experience a shift in the components of its source of funds from lower cost sources eg  traditional bank deposit products  including demand deposits to higher cost sources eg  federal home loan bank borrowings 
iii throughout the year  the yield curve for investment securities remained atypically flat the normal slope of the yield curve is caused by higher yields for instruments with longer maturities  which prevented management from obtaining a higher average yield on repriced assets 
the negative impact of the above factors on net interest income was exacerbated by the fact that paying liabilities typically reprice more quickly than earning assets putting pressure on margins in times of rising rates 
in this regard  however  management notes that much of the company s recent loan growth has occurred in the consumer loan sector  including indirect loans  a sector that tends to reprice relatively quickly 
other asset sectors  however  including residential mortgage loans and investment securities  are more resistant to upward repricing 
shortly after year end  the federal reserve board took action which resulted in two basis point decreases in the prevailing rates 
the board has given indications that rates may continue to decrease in forthcoming periods 
management is not able to predict with any certainty how the relative repricing of its asset and liability portfolios will proceed in forthcoming periods  or whether prevailing interest rates or the rates paid or earned by the company will continue to fall 
management does expect some improvement on margins attributable to rate decreases  for many of the same reasons discussed above that have led to narrower margins in periods of rising rates eg  liabilities repricing more rapidly than assets 
however  the company faces significant competitive pricing pressures in its marketplace for deposits as well as loans and some of the other factors discussed above that have applied pressure on margins recently  such as the shift in the overall sources of funds from lower to more costly sources  are not expected to disappear or have a beneficial impact in periods of decreasing rates 
in the analysis of to  the same compression of margins and spread was not experienced 
the company s spread between the yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities remained essentially the same for as for net interest margin for  at  represented a basis point decrease from the net interest margin of in the one basis point decrease in the spread reflected a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets and a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from to the basis point decrease in net interest margin in was principally attributable to the fact that average earning assets did not increase as rapidly as average paying liabilities 
from to  average earning assets increased while the increase in average paying liabilities was 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began to increase its cash and due from bank balances as a precautionary measure for any possible run on deposits as a result of perceived year problems 
this measure was one of the reasons for the fact that for average earning assets increased at a slower rate than average interest bearing liabilities 
in january  cash and due from banks returned to normal levels 
another reason for liabilities increasing faster than assets was that average shareholders equity decreased by from to  in response to the decision by the board and management during to continue with a stock repurchase program 
this decrease  although a contributing factor in liabilities expanding more rapidly than assets  also had the positive effect of further leveraging shareholders equity  thereby increasing per share returns 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands change change earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      demand deposits      total assets      earning assets to total assets 

in general  changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities will result in corresponding changes in net interest income  that is  as assets and liabilities increase  so will net interest income 
however  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities between instruments of different rates 
the change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of million in and million in during  average earning assets increased million  an increase of 
average paying liabilities grew at a somewhat faster pace  increasing by million  or 
the combined effect was to increase net interest income by approximately  before giving effect to the negative impact on net interest income resulting from the change in interest rates discussed in the previous section 
even this latter negative effect did not outweigh the positive effect of increased size  however 
the company experienced its growth in average earning assets principally within the loan portfolio  which increased million  or 
the fastest growing segment of the portfolio was indirect consumer loans  which are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where the company acquires the dealer paper 
average indirect loans increased million  or  from to the average balance of commercial loans increased million  or  during the year 
the company also experienced growth in the average balance of residential real estate loans of million  or  from to while the company experienced most of its growth in average paying liabilities from traditional banking deposit products  which increased by million  or  from to  the greatest percentage growth in liabilities occurred in fhlb borrowings which increased by million  or  above the average level in the prior year 
the negative impact on margins resulting from this shift in liabilities from lower to higher cost was discussed in the previous section of this report  change in net interest income due to rates 
the increase in deposit balances during occurred in the company s existing branch network  with the only physical expansion during the year being the addition of a drive up office in the ticonderoga market 
in the comparison between and  average earning assets increased by million  or  between and as discussed earlier  average interest bearing liabilities increased to a somewhat greater extent  by  between the two years 
on the earning asset side  the company experienced growth in its major loan categories commercial and commercial real estate  residential real estate and particularly indirect consumer loans 
indirect consumer loans accounted for the greatest portion of growth within the loan portfolio 
from to  the average balance of indirect loans increased million  or 
the company also experienced steady demand for residential real estate loans with average balances increasing million  or  from to the increase in average earning assets was funded by a million increase in average deposit balances  a million increase in average short term borrowings and by a million increase in average fhlb borrowings 
the growth in average deposit balances occurred primarily in demand deposits  now accounts and time deposits of  or more 
the growth in demand deposits and now accounts took place through the company s existing network of branches 
the growth in time deposits of  or more was primarily attributable to an increase in the balances and number of municipal depositors 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
the provision for loan losses was largely influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the year and the change in the mix and volume of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  essentially unchanged from the balance at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or  of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
while the company has experienced a slight decrease in nonperforming loans and gross charge offs over the past year  the company has also experienced significant growth in the loan portfolio and a shift in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio see c 
financial condition ii 
loan portfolio in this report 
indirect installment loans continue to increase as a percentage of overall loans and  given the nature of these loans  management perceives a somewhat higher level of risk in the current portfolio mix than in the prior periods 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period  an increase of thousand  or  from the prior year amount 
the principal reason for the increase in net loan losses in as compared with was a recovery of thousand in the period related to the final repayment of a large commercial loan 
excluding the large recovery  net loan losses for represented 
of average loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses was million for  an increase of thousand  or  from as in the case of the slightly increased provision for  the increased provision in reflected a shift in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio to loans characterized by slightly greater risk  as opposed to any increase in nonperforming loans or gross charge offs  both of which decreased in compared to levels 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of from the balance at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan  originally placed on nonaccrual status during  which was fully repaid in at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represented of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
the principal reason for the decrease in net loan losses was a recovery in of thousand related to the final repayment of the large commercial loan cited above 
excluding the large recovery  net loan losses for were 
of average loans 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of from the balance at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan  placed on nonaccrual status during  which fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of from the balance at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a large commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status during  the same loan discussed above that was fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were million  or  of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or  of average loans for the period 
in addition  in mid  the company made a purchase acquisition adjustment to the allowance of thousand for loans acquired in the fleet branch transaction 
this adjustment represented the allowance for inherent risk of loss in the loans acquired 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or  of average loans for the period 
however  the allowance for loan losses was significantly reduced during the year by million 
this was the amount of the reserve attributable to loans transferred in the divestiture of the vermont banking operations 
these reductions in the allowance for loan losses were offset in part by a provision for loan losses of thousand  or  of average loans for the year 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
the company s year experience with loan charge offs  provisioning for loan losses and maintenance of its loss allowance reflects a steady strengthening of loan quality and continuing application of high credit standards 
at year end  the coverage ratio was at its highest level in five years  but due to the relatively strong loan growth in the latter years of this period  the allowance as a percentage of total period end loans was at year end  a year low  and unchanged from prior year end 
while management believes that the year end allowance was adequate under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs

other income the majority of other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees to correspondents and other core or recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands change december  amount percent income from fiduciary activities    fees for other services to customers    net gains losses on securities transactions net gain on sale of credit card portfolio other operating income   total other income    total other income increased thousand  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions and one time nonrecurring items  total other income was million for and million for  an increase of thousand  or 
for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from the increase was in large part attributable to an increase in both the number of trust accounts and total assets under administration 
at year end  trust assets under administration amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end fees for other services to customers include deposit service charges  credit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase in was primarily attributable to three areas i increased fee income from processing merchant credit card transactions  ii increased service charges on deposit accounts  and iii increased brokerage fee income 
during  the company realized net securities losses of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
in the third quarter of  the company restructured a portion of its securities available for sale portfolio 
during that quarter  the company sold million of securities with a weighted average yield of at a net loss of thousand reflecting general price declines in the debt market during a period of rising rates 
the company reinvested a substantial portion of the proceeds in million of securities with a weighted average yield of the sale of the credit card portfolio in was discussed in the overview at the beginning of item in the past  the primary component of other operating income was fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for correspondent banks 
with the sale of the credit card portfolio at the end of the third quarter of  the company also discontinued servicing credit card portfolios for its correspondent banks 
income from servicing credit card portfolios amounted to thousand for nine months in and thousand for a full year in other operating income also includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income decreased thousand  or 
only a small part of this decrease was attributable the discontinuation of servicing correspondents credit card portfolios  the discontinuation of this business will have a much greater negative effect on other operating income in although this income reduction will be offset by corresponding decreases in related expense 
most of the decrease in other operating income between and was attributable to a nonrecurring event in the period  which was an award from a federally funded program to encourage lending in designated economically deprived areas 
on a recurring basis  other operating income increased thousand  or  from to the increase was primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of other real estate owned and increased canadian exchange fee income

during  the company realized net securities losses of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of these sales was to extend the maturity of certain securities due to mature near year end  to avoid possible decreases in rates in the investment securities markets accompanying the advent of the year during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of these sales was to extend the weighted average maturity of the investments in that portfolio

most other operating expenses associated with the credit card department were discontinued effective upon the sale 
overall  the company expects a reduction in other expense in attributable to the sale of the credit card business comparable in magnitude to the reduction in other operating income attributable thereto 
salaries and employee benefits increased thousand  or  from to employee benefits increased thousand  or during the period

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired or are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings

indirect loans are almost entirely auto vehicle acquisition loans to consumers financed through local dealerships where  by prior arrangement  the company acquires the dealer paper 
compared to year end  these loans had increased million at year end  or  and represented the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio  constituting of total loans 
residential real estate loans  the second largest segment at year end  at of total loans  increased million  or  from the prior year end 
in past years  the company has sold residential real estate loan originations to the secondary market  but in recent years has retained all residential real estate originations in its own portfolio 
the company also focused on its commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding 
at december  these loans had increased million  or  over year end levels 
during  the company experienced strong growth in the area of indirect automobile loans 
compared to year end  these loans increased million  or  and became the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio  contributing of total loans 
residential real estate loans  the second largest segment at of total loans at year end  increased million  or  from the prior year end 
the company s commercial and commercial real estate loans outstanding  at december   increased million  or  over year end levels 
in  the company saw considerable expansion in its indirect automobile lending program  which increased by million  or 
the company also experienced an increase in consumer installment loans in with most of the increase attributable to the fleet branch acquisition and the remainder principally due to steady growth of the indirect loan program 
also during  the company experienced a significant increase in originations for residential real estate loans 
the majority of the residential loan originations represented new money mortgages  rather than the refinancing of existing loans 
the increase in residential real estate loans in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of such loans incident to the purchase of the branches from fleet bank 
in the fleet branch acquisition completed on june   the company acquired million of loans consumer loans million  home equity loans million  commercial loans million  commercial real estate loans million  and residential real estate loans million 
since then  the communities served by the acquired branches have contributed to the internal loan growth experienced by the company

there is a time lag  however  between the federal reserve s changes in prevailing rates and the impact of those changes on the company s loan portfolio 
as discussed above in this report in the section entitled changes in net interest income due to rate  the federal reserve increased interest rates five times between mid and mid these increases had only a limited impact on the average yield of the company s portfolio during  but did increase average yields throughout in the fourth quarter of  the yield on the loan portfolio stabilized at  the same yield as the third quarter of the federal reserve reduced prevailing rates by basis points in january  and the company now expects that the yield on its loan portfolio will start to decline  but with a similar lag in time as during the period of increasing rates 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and repricing structure of the company s commercial  financial and agricultural loans and its real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
all of the real estate construction loans are for single family houses where the company has made a commitment for permanent financing 
maturity and repricing of commercial loans in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural     real estate construction   total     fixed interest rates     variable interest rates     total     commitments and lines of credit letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business which are not reflected in the financial statements because they were not yet funded 
as of december   the total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  the company has issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
b 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
when nonaccrual loans reach days delinquent  they are charged off against the allowance for loan losses in an amount equal to unpaid principal less the fair value of collateral plus estimated costs to sell 
there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the following table  are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
sfas no 
requires that impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all restructured loans 
reserves for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual  cash basis and cost recovery 
the company s nonperforming loans were as follows schedule of nonperforming loans dollars in thousands december  nonaccrual loans construction commercial real estate commercial loans   residential real estate loans   consumer loans total nonaccrual loans      loans past due days or more and still accruing interest restructured loans in compliance with modified terms total nonperforming loans      total nonperforming loans as a percentage of period end loans 




there were no impaired loans at december  or within the scope of sfas no 
at december   one commercial loan was considered an impaired loan under sfas no 
with a recorded investment of thousand  an allowance for loan losses of thousand and a net carrying amount of thousand 
this loan was included in nonaccrual loans in the schedule of nonperforming loans above 
at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand from december  loans past due or more days and still accruing interest amounted to thousand at december   a decrease of thousand from december  total nonperforming loans  at year end  represented

income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of thousand from december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan which was originally placed on nonaccrual status during and the final portion of which was repaid in loans past due or more days and still accruing interest amounted to thousand at december   a decrease of thousand from december  total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  a decrease from

at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of million from december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status during which was fully paid off in loans past due or more days and still accruing interest amounted to thousand at december   an increase of thousand from december  total nonperforming loans  at year end  represented

at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  an increase of million from december  the increase was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status during  the same loan referenced above that was paid off in loans past due or more days and still accruing interest amounted to thousand at december   an increase of thousand from december  total nonperforming loans  at year end  represented

at december   nonaccrual loans amounted to million  a decrease of million from the year end total 
during  nearly all of the nonaccrual loans in the company s vermont portfolio were transferred in connection with the company s sale of its last remaining vermont operations that year 
nonaccrual loans in the company s new york subsidiary banks at december  were virtually unchanged from the level at the prior year end 
during income recognized on year end balances of nonaccrual loans was thousand 
income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans if all such had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  the company applies an internal credit quality rating system to past due commercial loans 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
because of its aggressive approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  the company typically does not separately identify any potential problem loans in its portfolio that do not otherwise meet one of the classifications discussed above eg  nonaccrual  troubled debt restructurings 
the overall level of the company s classified and problem loans from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in the company s geographic market area was strong in the period 
in the capital district in and around albany  unemployment remained below the national average  and north of the capital district  in the company s principal service areas  the total number of jobs held steady over the period with nominal growth in the job rate 
however  unemployment remains above the national average in the glens falls area and in essex county 
foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section iia of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate loans are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the banks loan portfolios and report on these examinations to management 
the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
in addition to conclusions regarding the adequacy of the allowance  the provision for loan losses is influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance during prior periods and the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated among the loan categories indicated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned unallocated values to categories in the table solely for purposes of compliance with the disclosure requirements  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the designated categories 
on a quarterly basis  management risk classifies delinquent or problem loans except for consumer installment loans and residential real estate loans as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
reserves are assigned to all loans by either a specific allocation  a risk classified loss percentage or by a percentage applied to individual categories of loans 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated

in comparing quarterly average deposits for the fourth quarter of and  quarterly average deposit balances increased million  or 
all categories increased between the two periods except for interest bearing demand deposits  however  regular and money market savings and time deposits of  or more increased both in dollar amount and as a percentage of total quarterly average balances as illustrated in the table below percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
in the first quarter of  the company offered a competitive money market savings product in the saratoga springs market area 
this product was responsible for most of the growth between the fourth quarters of and in regular and money market savings average balances 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by the company on its various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by its competitors  which themselves are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of deposit liabilities by the company 
thus  the five rate increases in the federal funds target rate initiated by the federal reserve between mid and mid resulted in a steady increase in the company s cost of funds over the five quarters presented in the table above 
in january  the federal reserve board  in two separate actions  decreased prevailing rates by basis points 
the company expects that these decreases will ultimately lead to lower cost of deposits  following a typical time lag between federal reserve actions and repricing of its deposit liabilities  although the company is not able to give assurances that its average cost of deposits will decrease

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of the company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost 
the company must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  the company must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  the company has supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company has established overnight and day term lines of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb each in the amount of million at december  if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
in addition  the company has in place borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and the federal reserve bank of new york and also has identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding 
the company measures and monitors its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in shareholders equity during primarily reflected million of retained earnings and an increase of million related to net unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  on securities available for sale  partially offset by million of periodic repurchases of the company s common stock 
in december  the company  through a newly formed subsidiary business trust  privately placed million in capital securities with several institutional investors 
the securities have certain features that make them an alternative funding vehicle and the proceeds qualify as regulatory capital under the capital adequacy guidelines discussed below 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the company and the subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity and capital securities issued by the company s subsidiary business trust less intangible assets 
total capital includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of the company s allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of the company and its subsidiary banks as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december   the company and both of its subsidiary banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by these guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the disclosure under legislative developments in part i  item f of this report 
the principal source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by the company has been dividends declared and paid to the company by its bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the company by its subsidiaries as well as the payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the company was approximately million 
the ability of the company and the banks to pay dividends in the future is  and is expected to continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in the company s loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  the company s business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage related assets  early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a increase in net interest income 
these amounts were within the company s alco policy limits 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions in january to decrease the prevailing interest rates  after a month period of increasing interest rates 
management believes it likely that rates will continue to fall in forthcoming periods  although there can be no assurance that this will actually occur 
while management believes that the decline in prevailing interest rates will have a positive impact on net interest margin and net interest income  it is not able to predict with certainty that such a positive effect will be experienced or what the magnitude of the positive effect  if any  would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
