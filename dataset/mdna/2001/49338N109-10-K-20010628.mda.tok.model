the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december to april 
the impact of seasonality has reduced somewhat as keystone has become more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the reduced number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  general economic conditions that affect consumer spending  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary need for funds over the past two years has been to finance the growth of inventory and accounts receivable and to develop and implement an enterprise wide management information system 
over the next to months  the company estimates that it will spend an additional million to million to complete the installation and implementation of the management information system 
at march   working capital was million compared to million at march  the increase in working capital is primarily the result of increases in inventory  accounts receivable and deferred taxes  offset in part by increased borrowing under the company s line of credit 
the company has been financing its working capital requirements from its cash flow from operations and advances drawn under its line of credit 
during fiscal  the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by  this increase is the result of an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million from a variety of sources  primarily the non cash impact of depreciation and amortization and write downs of impaired assets  offset in part by i a decrease in cash used in investing activities of million  primarily as a result of cash used to purchase property and equipment primarily related to the implementation of the company s enterprise software package  and ii a decrease in cash provided by financing activities of million  primarily as a result of the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock  offset in part by paydowns with respect to the company s borrowings 
the company has in place a revolving line of credit with its commercial lender that provides for a million unsecured credit facility that expires in november advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus 
at june   million had been drawn down under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the loan agreement  which requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the company was not in compliance with all such covenants as of march   but obtained a waiver from its commercial lender prior to the filing of this annual report 
in fiscal  the company initiated a stock repurchase program 
through june   an aggregate of million shares had been repurchased for million  an average of per share 
during fiscal   shares were repurchased for million  an average of per share 
the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations  including implementation of the management information system  and possible acquisitions  for at least the next months 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability 
goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at march   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the amortization of goodwill in fiscal was approximately million  or approximately of pretax income 
the company s estimate of the useful life of goodwill of between and years is considered appropriate due to the long term nature of the business  including its customers  supply sources and longevity of operations 
the risk associated with the carrying value of goodwill is whether future operating income before amortization of goodwill will be sufficient on an undiscounted basis to recover the carrying value 
the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
the measurement of possible impairment is based on either significant losses of an entity or the inability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if an impairment exists  the amount of such impairment would be calculated based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values compared to the recorded costs 
in management s opinion  the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and no impairment existed at march  however  any significant change in the useful lives of goodwill  as estimated by management  or any changes to accounting for goodwill as new accounting standards are issued in the future  could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under its credit facility  where interest rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current levels of debt  the exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations  primarily with respect to its product purchases in taiwan 
while all transactions with taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and new taiwan dollars might impact the price of products purchased in taiwan 
the company might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
under its present policies  the company does not attempt to hedge its currency exchange rate exposure
