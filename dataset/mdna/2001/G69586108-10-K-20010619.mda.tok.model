hong kong profits tax under the hong kong tax authority s departmental interpretation and practice notes  a company based in hong kong but with substantially all of its manufacturing operations located in the prc conducted pursuant to a processing agreement entered into with a prc company can enjoy profit apportionment through which much of its manufacturing profit is subject to hong kong profits tax 
substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located in shenzhen  china and conducted pursuant to a processing agreement entered into with a prc company 
see item  business employees 
effective as of april   the profits tax rate in hong kong is  a change from the former profits tax rate  which was 
under our current profits apportionment  only of our profits are subject to hong kong profits tax and  as a result  we enjoy a lower effective tax rate than would otherwise be the case 
we cannot assure that the hong kong tax authority will continue to grant such tax concession to hong kong companies with manufacturing operations in china  or that we will not lose such concession in the future as a result of changes in hong kong tax law or the interpretation of such law 
in the event that such tax concessions are unavailable to us  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
although traditionally  hong kong has allowed a company like ours to apportion only of its profits to activities outside hong kong not subject to hong kong tax  starting in fiscal  for tax filing purposes  we have apportioned of our profits to activities outside of hong kong 
the hong kong tax authorities are examining our activities with respect to several factors that they use to ascertain the true geographic nature of a company s activities 
although we believe our apportionment to be justified  we cannot assure that the hong kong tax authorities will not insist on a different apportionment that would subject us to payment of back taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange rate fluctuations our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars while our costs of goods sold are generally incurred in us dollars  hong kong dollars and renminbi  and our operating expenses are generally denominated in renminbi  hong kong dollars and us dollars 
in addition  a substantial portion of our capital expenditures  primarily for the purchase of equipment  has been and is expected to continue to be denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
consequently  a portion of our costs and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and other currencies 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of new or additional currency controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
primarily in response to recent developments in the southeast asian currency markets  we from time to time engage in derivatives trading activities  such as entering into forward contracts  to hedge our currency exchange exposure 
the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments for speculative purposes 
at march   we had no outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts 
many of our competitors are located in countries whose currencies devalued significantly against the us dollar beginning in the second half of as a result of such devaluation  these competitors products have become less expensive in us dollar terms 
this reduction could result in our customers purchasing products from these competitors rather than from us  which could have a material and adverse effect on our net sales and results of operation 
pvc resin price pvc resin  the principal raw material used in the manufacture of tubes  together with additives used in the manufacture of tubes accounted for  and of our total raw material costs in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
while we believe principally as a result of increased production capacity by suppliers  that a severe shortage in the supply of pvc resin is unlikely to occur in the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that such shortage will not occur 
any price increases would result in higher costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently maintain approximately two to three months stock of pvc resin and other raw materials used in our production processes  and increase such stock when we believe prices are favorable 
we do not  and do not intend to  enter into future contracts or use any financial instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of pvc resin or other raw materials used in our production processes
