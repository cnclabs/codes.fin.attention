market risks and sensitivity analyses like other global companies  six flags is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of financial risk management at six flags is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the company s operations  cash flows and equity 
six flags does not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  on a limited basis six flags has used derivative financial instruments  exclusively foreign exchange forward contracts 
these derivative financial instruments have been held to maturity and six flags has used non leveraged instruments 
these contracts have been entered into with major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
six flags has used forward contracts to lock in the us dollar cost of equipment to be purchased from foreign vendors or manufacturers where the contracts related thereto are denominated in foreign currency 
at december   no such contracts were outstanding 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of six flags accounting policies and use of such instruments 
in february  the company amended its three interest rate swap agreements that for the term of the applicable amendments ranging from december to march effectively convert the company s million term loan into a fixed rate obligation 
the company s term loan borrowings bear interest at above the libor rate 
the company s interest rate swap agreements effectively lock in the libor component at rates ranging from to and average 
the counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  which minimizes the credit risk 
the following analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value  operations and cash flows of six flags market risk financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates as if these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for this analysis reflect six flags view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact six flags business as a result of these changes in interest and exchange rates 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis at december   six flags had debt totaling  million  of which  million represents fixed rate debt and the balance represents floating rate debt 
after giving effect to the january equity and debt offerings and the use of proceeds therefrom  total debt at that date would have been  million  of which  million would have represented fixed rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact book value  operations or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future operations and cash flows  assuming other factors remain constant 
additionally  increases and decrease in interest rates impact the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
a decrease in thirty and ninety day libor interest rates increases the fair value liability of the interest rate swap agreements 
however  over the term of the interest rate swap agreements  the economic effect of changes in interest rates is fixed as the company will pay a fixed amount and not be subject to changes in interest rates 
assuming other variables remain constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  after giving effect to the financings and assuming an average annual balance on the company s working capital revolver  the pre tax operations and cash flows impact resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million million after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements 
impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  as a result of the adoption  the company recognized a liability of approximately million and recorded in other comprehensive income loss the amount net of tax effect as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
