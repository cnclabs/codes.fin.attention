net income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to significantly higher gas and ngl prices in compared to the prior year  increased production from the powder river coal bed methane development  improved marketing margins  an after tax gain of million recognized on the sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  western gas resources california  in the first quarter of and an after tax gain of million recognized on the sale of the arkoma gathering system in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by after tax losses on hedging activities on our equity gas and ngls of million and an after tax extraordinary charge of million for the early extinguishment of long term debt also in the third quarter of the results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a combined after tax loss of million from the sale of the giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities and related severance charges  settlement of ongoing litigation and an after tax extraordinary charge of million for the early extinguishment of long term debt 
revenues from the sale of gas increased  million to  million for the year ended december  compared to this increase was due to an improvement in product prices in which more than offset a reduction in sales volume 
average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in the sale of gas purchased from third parties resulting from the sale in of our katy gas storage facility which more than offset an increase in volumes available from our coal bed methane production 
revenues from the sale of ngls increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to this increase is due to an improvement in product prices and an increase in sales volume 
average ngl prices realized by us increased 
per gallon to 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to average ngl sales volumes increased mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to this increase in ngl volume is due to an increase in the sale of ngls purchased from third parties 
product purchases increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to an increase in commodity prices and an increase in ngls purchased from third parties 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained constant at for the year ended december  and in marketing margins on residue gas averaged 
per mcf in this represents a significant increase as compared to the margin realized during of 
per mcf 
the margins realized in are reflective of the current volatile market conditions and our ability to benefit from these conditions through our transportation arrangements 
marketing margins on ngls averaged 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to approximately 
per gallon in there is no assurance  however  that these market conditions for our gas and ngl products and related margins will continue in the future or that we will be in a similar position to benefit from them 
in addition  during  we reserved a total of million for doubtful accounts 
this reserve is not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and is reported in selling and administrative expenses 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to these increases are due to increased production taxes and lease operating expenses resulting from our increased drilling and production activities in the powder river coal bed methane development 
selling and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to these increases are due to higher insurance costs  increased compensation and severance costs  increased accruals for doubtful accounts and compensation recorded for re priced stock options 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and our acquisition of the remaining of the westana gathering company in the first quarter of these increases more than offset reductions in depreciation from the sales of our giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities in in  we realized a net pre tax gain of million on the sale of our california subsidiary and our arkoma gathering system 
in  we realized a net pre tax loss of million on the sales of our giddings  katy  mivida and black lake facilities 
extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt increased by a net after tax charge of  for the year ended december  compared to in  we prepaid million of outstanding indebtedness to insurance companies  originally due to be paid in november  with funds available under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we incurred approximately million for pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
this compares to the prepayment in of million of indebtedness to various insurance companies 
in connection with the prepayments  we incurred approximately million for pre tax yield maintenance and other charges

overall  the net loss decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net loss for the year was primarily due to a million  after tax  charge for impairment recorded in in connection with the evaluation of a decrease in product prices and the impact on our bethel  black lake and sand dunes facilities  as required by sfas no 
revenues from the sale of gas decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average gas sales volumes decreased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to an decrease in third party sales activity 
the decrease in volumes sold was partially offset by an increase in average gas prices 
our average gas price increased 
per mcf to per mcf for the year ended december  compared to included in this gas price is approximately million of loss recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity volumes 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to average ngl sales volumes decreased  mgal per day to  mgal per day for the year ended december  compared to  due to a decrease in third party sales activity of  mgal per day and a decrease in plant sales volumes of mgal per day 
plant ngl sales volumes were largely affected by increased volumes taken in kind and curtailed drilling activity due to low oil prices by a producer behind midkiff  and the sale of our edgewood and giddings facilities 
volumes taken in kind affect sales volumes and revenues but do not materially affect income 
the decrease in sales volumes was partially offset by an increase in average ngl prices 
our average ngl price increased 
per gallon to 
per gallon for the year ended december  compared to included in this ngl price was approximately million of loss recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity volumes 
processing  transportation and storage revenue increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to due to increased volumes transported by our migc pipeline resulting from the activity in the powder river basin 
the reduction in product purchases of million to billion for the year ended december  compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in product prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products remained constant at for the year ended december  compared to our margins on third party sales of natural gas have narrowed from 
per mcf in to 
per mcf in this decrease is partially due to increasing competitiveness in the marketplace 
contributing to this decrease in was the sale of our katy storage facility in april this facility generated higher margins per mcf as we were able to capture the summer winter price differential on our storage position 
plant operating expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reorganization of our operating areas as a result of the sales of the giddings  mivida  and katy facilities during depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the sales of the giddings  mivida  and katy facilities during and impairment charges recognized against our bethel and black lake facilities in and interest expense decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the decrease is the result of an overall reduction in long term debt of million with the proceeds from our asset sales in the resulting decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest rates on our senior debt facilities and on the senior subordinated debt 
in connection with the repayments on the senior debt  we incurred approximately million of pre tax yield maintenance and other charges 
these charges are reflected as an extraordinary charge from early extinguishment of long term debt in business strategy in and  as oil and gas prices were approaching historical lows  our activities were focused on consolidating our businesses in our core operating regions and reducing our outstanding debt 
improved product prices throughout and continuing into along with our improved financial position will allow us to emphasize the growth aspects of our business strategy 
our long term business plan is to increase our profitability by i optimizing the efficiency and utilization of our existing operations  ii developing natural gas reserves and increasing production volumes on our existing acreage positions  and iii investing in projects or acquiring assets that complement and extend our core natural gas gathering  processing  production and marketing businesses 
with our improved financial position  in  we will actively evaluate acquisitions of either assets or companies 
these acquisitions can be related to gathering and processing or production with emphasis on properties located in the rocky mountains or canada 
capital expenditures budgeted for existing operations in are estimated to be approximately million 
this includes approximately million related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets and approximately million for the acquisition of undeveloped acreage and development of gas reserves in the powder river basin 
this budget will be increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
we constantly seek to improve the profitability of our existing operations by increasing natural gas throughput levels through new well connections and expansion of our gathering systems  increasing our efficiency through the modernization of equipment and consolidation of existing gathering and processing facilities  evaluating the economic performance of each of our operating facilities to ensure that a targeted rate of return is achieved and controlling operating and overhead expenses 
we continually seek to increase reserves dedicated to our facilities 
our operations are located in some of the most actively drilled oil and gas producing basins in the united states 
we enter into agreements under which we gather and process natural gas produced on acreage dedicated to us by third parties 
we contract for production from new wells and newly dedicated acreage in order to replace declines in existing reserves or increase reserves that are dedicated for gathering and processing at our facilities 
at december   our estimated dedicated reserves totaled tcf 
in  including the reserves developed by us and associated with our partnerships and excluding the reserves and production associated with the facilities sold during this period  we connected new reserves to our facilities to replace approximately of throughput 
in order to obtain additional dedicated acreage and to secure contracts on favorable terms  we may participate to a limited extent with third party producers in exploration and production activities that supply our facilities 
for the same reason  we may also offer to sell ownership interests in our facilities to selected producers 
we selectively participate in exploration and production activities largely to secure additional gas supply for our facilities 
beginning in  we substantially increased our investment in the acquisition of undeveloped acreage and development of the powder river coal bed methane 
we have acquired drilling rights on approximately  net acres in the basin 
at december  we have proved developed and undeveloped reserves of approximately bcf on a portion of this acreage 
we also have participated in the development of properties in southwest wyoming and colorado 
these properties have an additional bcf of proved developed and undeveloped reserves 
this represents an increase of approximately in our proved reserves from december  we also estimate a net total of tcf of probable or possible reserves on an unrisked basis associated with undeveloped acreage in these areas 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the ultimate recovery of these probable or possible reserves 
we will also consider investing in other exploration and production prospects that we consider to be low risk and complementary to our other business segments 
we will continue to invest in projects that complement and extend our core natural gas gathering  processing  production and marketing businesses including the consideration of expansion into additional geographic areas in the continental united states and canada 
in the third quarter of  our board of directors retained an executive search firm to identify and evaluate both internal and external candidates to replace our current chief executive officer and president  lanny outlaw who has informed the board of his intention to retire may  in accordance with his contract 
mr 
outlaw will continue to serve on the board of directors 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and we may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
in  we completed the sales of our giddings  katy and mivida facilities 
in december  we contracted for the sale of the black lake facility and related reserves 
this sale closed in january in  we sold the stock of our subsidiary  western gas resources california  inc and our arkoma gathering system for a combined pre tax gain of approximately million 
we contracted for the sale of the stock in our wholly owned subsidiary pinnacle gas treating  inc in december for gross proceeds of approximately million 
this sale closed in january we used the proceeds from these sales of approximately million to reduce debt 
primarily as a result of these sales  we have reduced our total outstanding debt from million at december  to million at january  product prices  sales of inventory  the volumes of natural gas processed by our facilities  the volumes of natural gas produced from our reserves  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of our receivables will affect net cash provided by operating activities in the future 
our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  increasing our production  completing acquisitions  developing new projects  operating our facilities efficiently and obtaining financing at favorable terms 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities and the sale of non strategic assets  will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities  complete our current capital expenditure program and make any scheduled debt principal payments 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure additional capital is in some cases restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or a combination of alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
we also believe that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements for and while several of our plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves  overall we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset the natural declines 
higher gas prices  greater demand for natural gas  improved technology  eg  d seismic  well fracturing and horizontal drilling  and increased pipeline capacity from the rocky mountain region have stimulated drilling in many of our operating areas 
the overall level of drilling will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for oil and gas  the drilling budgets of third party producers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which is within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which those securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
our sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands sources of funds borrowings under revolving credit facility  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment  net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from exercise of common stock options  other total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt including debt issue costs  capital expenditures  dividends paid  re purchase of cumulative perpetual preferred stock early extinguishment of senior debt  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to us are our inventories of gas and ngls in storage facilities 
we store gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
we held gas in storage and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  under storage contracts at various third party facilities 
at december   we had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mcf for the stored inventory 
see item and business and properties significant acquisitions  projects and dispositions katy 
we held ngls in storage under exchange agreements of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and  respectively 
at december   we had no significant hedging contracts in place for these volumes 
preferred stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of  we purchased in open market transactions a total of  shares of our cumulative preferred stock for a total cost  including broker commissions  of approximately million  or an average of per share of preferred stock 
these shares will be retired 
our board of directors has authorized the re purchase from time to time of up to an additional million of preferred stock in open market transactions 
capital investment program primarily as a result of additional drilling behind our systems and in the powder river basin  we increased our capital budget for the year ending december  by approximately million from our original budget 
capital expenditures related to existing operations totaled approximately million during  consisting of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets  of which million was for maintaining existing facilities and million for acquisition of the remaining interest in the westana gathering company  ii approximately million related to exploration and production activities  and iii approximately million for miscellaneous items 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represented and  respectively  of our total capital expenditures in we expect capital expenditures related to existing operations to be approximately million during  consisting of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets  of which million is for maintaining existing facilities  ii approximately million related to exploration and production activities  and iii approximately million for miscellaneous items 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
this budget will be increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
financing facilities revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and provides for a maximum borrowing commitment of million consisting of an million day revolving credit facility  or tranche a  and a four year million revolving credit facility  or tranche b 
at december   million in total was outstanding on this facility 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at certain spreads over the eurodollar rate  or the greater of the federal funds rate or the agent bank s prime rate 
we have the option to determine which rate will be used 
we also pay a facility fee on the commitment 
the interest rate spreads and facility fee are adjusted based on our debt to capitalization ratio and range from 
to 
at december   the interest rate payable on the facility was 
we are required to maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter  and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter 
the agreement also requires a quarterly test of the ratio of ebitda excluding some non recurring items for the last four quarters  to interest and dividends on preferred stock for the same period 
the ratio must exceed to through september  and increases periodically to to by december  this facility is guaranteed by and secured via a pledge of the stock of our significant subsidiaries 
we generally utilize excess daily funds to reduce any outstanding balances on the revolving credit facility and associated interest expense 
master shelf agreement 
in december  we entered into a master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company of america 
amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement at december  are as indicated in the following table dollars in thousands interest final issue date amount rate maturity principal payments due october   october   on each of october  through december   december  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   on each of july  through in  we amended our agreement with prudential to reflect the following provisions 
we are required to maintain a current ratio  as defined therein  of at least 
to  a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net earnings earned from january  plus of the net proceeds of any equity offerings after january   a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through december  and of not more than thereafter and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than through march and not more than thereafter 
this agreement also requires an ebitda to interest ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  and an ebitda to interest on senior debt ratio of not less than to increasing to a ratio of not less than to by march  ebitda in these calculations excludes certain non recurring items 
in addition  this agreement contains a calculation limiting dividends under which approximately million was available at december  we are currently paying an annual fee of on the amounts outstanding on the master shelf agreement 
this fee will continue until we receive an implied investment grade rating on our senior secured debt 
borrowings under the master shelf agreement are guaranteed by and secured via a pledge of the stock of our significant subsidiaries 
senior notes 
in  we sold million of senior notes  the senior notes  to a group of insurance companies with an interest rate of per annum 
in march  we prepaid million of the principal amount outstanding on the senior notes at par 
the remaining principal amount outstanding of million was prepaid in september with funds available under the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the prepayment in  we paid a pre tax make whole payment of approximately million and expensed capitalized fees of approximately  the combined costs of approximately million  net of a tax benefit of  are reflected as an extraordinary charge on early extinguishment of debt in the year ended december senior subordinated notes 
in  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment which were subsequently exchanged for registered publicly tradable notes under the same terms and conditions 
the subordinated notes bear interest at and were priced at to yield 
these notes contain maintenance covenants which include limitations on debt incurrence  restricted payments  liens and sales of assets 
the subordinated notes are unsecured and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by some of our subsidiaries 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses which have been capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the notes 
covenant compliance 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements at december  taking into account all the covenants contained in these agreements  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity at december  risk management activities our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our gas  crude oil and ngl marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to hedging fixed price purchase and sale commitments  preserving the value of storage inventories  reducing exposure to physical market price volatility and providing risk management services to a variety of customers 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these objectives 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we use futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with various counterparties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct our standard credit review of otc counterparties and have agreements with these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by our ability to require a margin deposit from our major counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  we are subject to similar margin deposit requirements for our nymex counterparties related to our net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
for  we have entered into hedging positions for approximately  mmbtu per day of our equity gas volumes at an average of per mmbtu 
we have hedged an additional  mmbtu per day of equity gas in the first quarter of with a collar providing for a minimum price of per mmbtu and a maximum price of per mmbtu 
these positions represent approximately percent of our projected equity gas volumes in additionally  we have placed floors on approximately  barrels per day of our equity production of crude  condensate and ngls at a net equivalent minimum oil price of per barrel 
this represents approximately percent of our forecasted ngl production 
all prices are nymex equivalents 
for  we have hedged approximately  mmbtus per day  or percent of our projected equity gas production  with collar structures providing for an average minimum price of per mmbtu and an average maximum price of per mmbtu 
these prices are nymex equivalents 
we have not hedged any equity ngl volumes in at december  we had  of gains unrecognized in inventory that will be recognized primarily during the first quarter of which may be partially offset by losses from our related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
at december  we had unrecognized net losses of  related to financial instruments that are expected to be offset by corresponding unrecognized net gains from our obligations to sell physical quantities of gas and ngls 
we enter into speculative futures  swap and option trades on a very limited basis for purposes that include testing of hedging techniques 
our policies contain strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open positions limits 
speculative futures  swap and option positions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
net gains or losses from such speculative activities for the years ended december  and were not material 
natural gas derivative market risk 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to january with a weighted average duration of approximately three months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
we use a value at risk var model designed by jp morgan as one measure of market risk for our natural gas portfolio 
the var calculated by this model represents the maximum change in market value over the holding period at the specified statistical confidence interval 
the var model is generally based upon jp morgan s riskmetrics tm methodology using historical price data to derive estimates of volatility and correlation for estimating the contribution of tenor and location risk 
the var model assumes a one day holding period and uses a confidence level 
as of december   the calculated var of our entire natural gas portfolio of futures  swaps and options was approximately million 
this figure includes the risk related to our entire portfolio of natural gas financial instruments and does not include the related underlying hedged physical transactions 
all financial instruments for which there are no offsetting physical transactions are treated as either the hedge of an anticipated transaction or a speculative trade 
as of december   the var of these type of transactions for natural gas was approximately  crude oil and ngl derivative market risk 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately seven months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we had purchased puts for  barrels per month of nymex monthly average settlement of per barrel to hedge a portion of the company s equity production of natural gasoline  condensates  butanes and crude oil 
we do not hold any crude oil futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   we had purchased puts for  barrels per month of opis mt 
belvieu monthly average settlement of 
per gallon to hedge a portion of our equity production of propane for as of december   we had purchased puts for  barrels per month of opis mt 
belvieu monthly average settlement of 
per gallon of purity ethane to hedge a portion of our equity production of ethane for as of december   we did not hold any ngl futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   the estimated fair value of the aforementioned crude oil and ngl options held by us was approximately million 
foreign currency derivative market risk 
as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximates its fair market value 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximated its fair market value 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  the fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 effective for fiscal years beginning after june  under sfas no 
 which was subsequently amended by sfas no 
 we will be required to recognize the change in the market value of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income depending upon the nature of the underlying transaction 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   the impact from our hedging activities was a decrease in a component of stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income of million  an increase to current assets of  an increase to current liabilities of million  an increase in other long term liabilities of  and an increase in deferred income taxes payable of million 
we adopted mark to market accounting in the first quarter of for the remainder of our marketing activities which for various reasons are not designated or qualified as hedges under sfas upon adoption of mark to market accounting for our marketing activities on january   the impact was a net increase to pre tax income through an unrealized gain of million  an increase to current assets of million  an increase to current liabilities of million and an increase to other long term liabilities of environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  transporting  processing  treating or storing of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ four environmental engineers  four safety specialists and three regulatory compliance specialists to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform environmental assessments of our existing facilities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
we believe that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the texas natural resource conservation commission which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  has created a committee to make recommendations to the commission regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grand fathered air emissions sources within texas 
a grand fathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to we operate a number of these sources within texas  including portions of our midkiff benedum  gomez and mitchell puckett systems 
in connection with a modernization program  we are replacing all of our grand fathered compressors in texas and expect to complete this process in other grand fathered sources  if not permitted or modified  may be subject to increasing emissions fees beginning in we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we anticipate that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be towards stricter standards 
we are unaware of future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  but we cannot rule out that possibility 
we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
although we anticipate that such environmental expenses per facility will increase over time  we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations
