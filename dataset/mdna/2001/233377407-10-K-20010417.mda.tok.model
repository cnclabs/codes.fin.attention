item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general our products and services are marketed in states to over  customers that are engaged in a variety of industries  many of which may be counter cyclical to each other 
demand for our products generally is subject to changes in the united states economy and economic trends affecting our customers and the industries in which they compete in particular 
certain of these industries  such as the oil and gas industry  are subject to volatility while others  such as the petrochemical industry and the construction industry  are cyclical and materially affected by changes in the economy 
as a result  we may experience changes in demand within particular markets  segments and product categories as changes occur in our customers respective markets 
our growth strategy in the past focused on a combination of acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the electrical contractor segment  and internal growth 
we have curtailed our acquisition efforts and are focusing on internal growth 
key elements of our internal growth strategy include leveraging existing customer relationships  expanding product offerings to new and existing customers  reducing costs through consolidated purchasing programs and centralized product distribution centers  centralizing certain customer service and inside sales functions  reducing costs by converting selected branches from full warehouse and customer service operations to sales centers  designing and implementing innovative solutions to address the procurement and supply needs of our customers and using our traditional distribution and integrated supply capabilities to increase sales in each area 
results will be dependent on our success in executing our internal growth strategy and  to the extent we complete any acquisitions  our ability to integrate such acquisitions 
results of operations years ended december  in millions  except percentages sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative non recurring operating charges operating income loss interest expense other income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for decreased to approximately million from million in the valve segment  which was sold during the third quarter of  generated revenues in of million 
excluding these revenues  current year revenues actually increased by million when compared to sales for the mro segment increased million  or  primarily due to an improvement in the oil and gas industry 
sales for the electrical contractor segment declined by million  or  as a result of employee turnover and continued loss of market share to competitors 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales declined by approximately for  when compared to  on a consolidated basis and for the mro segment 
the majority of this decline occurred at a one location operation  which was acquired prior to this operation serves primarily one customer 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for the electrical contractor segment remained relatively constant for  when compared to  as the segment maintained gross margin but lost market share 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for declined by approximately million when compared to as a percentage of revenue  the expense declined by approximately to from for non recurring operating charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of non recurring operating charges 
these charges consist of an million charge for the impairment of goodwill and other assets associated with acquisitions completed before  a million charge to write off fixed assets of computer systems which are being replaced and facilities which have been closed  and million of accruals primarily associated with future rent on closed facilities 
approximately million and million of this charge pertained to the electrical contracting segment and mro segment  respectively 
as a result of increasingly poor financial results for the acquired operations  we evaluated our recoverability of goodwill and other assets recorded in connection with all of our acquisitions 
all of our acquisitions were completed prior to these operations have been experiencing declining revenues and declining operating margins 
we determined that the expected future undiscounted cash flows of four acquisitions were below their carrying value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
operating income 
excluding the million of nonrecurring operating charges  operating income for increased million when compared to this increase is the net of a million increase in operating income for the mro segment  a million increase in operating loss for the electrical contractor segment and a million decline in operating income resulting from the sale of the valve segment 
the improved operating income  exclusive of nonrecurring charges  for the mro segment is the result of increased sales and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increased loss for the electrical contractors segment is the result of the continued loss of market share and a decrease in sales 
interest expense 
interest expense for remained constant when compared to although our average outstanding debt balance between the two years was lower in compared to  the increased interest rates we paid as a result of amending the credit facility combined with the market increase in interest rates and default interest rate  resulted in interest expense remaining relatively constant 
other income 
other income for was approximately million higher than in due primarily to the sale of two mro facilities during for approximately million 
gains on the sale of these properties were approximately million 
income taxes 
as of december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million representing the future tax benefits of certain accruals not currently deductible 
we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized as these reserves are recovered and reduce future taxable income 
for information concerning the provision for current and deferred income taxes as well as information regarding differences between the effective tax rates and statutory rates  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
revenues for decreased to approximately million from million in our acquisitions during  which included the electrical contractor segment  accounted for million in revenues during the valve segment  which was sold during the third quarter of  generated revenues in of million compared to million in excluding revenues generated by the operations acquired in and the valve segment sold during  revenues decreased by to million from million in this decrease in revenues for the mro segment  excluding the acquisitions  resulted primarily from the effects associated with the decline in oil prices in and a slow recovery by the oil industry in along with a softness in the mining industry 
revenues for the electrical contracting segment for declined slightly from even though revenues include less than nine months of operations since dates of acquisition 
this decline resulted from employee turnover associated with the change in ownership 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for decreased by approximately million  or  when compared to  and is primarily attributable to the decrease in selling expenses resulting from lower sales 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense for increased by to as compared to in this was due primarily to the decrease in revenue volume which outpaced the expense reduction effort undertaken by us during operating income 
operating income for decreased by million  to million  from million in this decline is primarily due to the fact that the decrease in revenue volume outpaced the expense reduction efforts undertaken by us 
this decrease is the net of a million decrease in operating income for the mro segment  a million decrease to a million operating loss for the electrical contracting segment and a million increase in operating income for the valve segment 
the decline in operating income for the mro segment resulted primarily from the decline in sales combined with the fact that costs did not decline commensurate with the sales decline 
operating income for the electrical contracting segment resulted from sales declining faster than costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for remained relatively consistent when compared to liquidity and capital resources general as a distributor of mro products and electrical contractor products  we require significant amounts of working capital to fund inventories and accounts receivable 
additional cash is required for capital items such as information technology and warehouse equipment 
we also require cash to pay our lease obligations and to service our debt under the company s loan agreements with its bank lender the credit facility  all available cash is generally applied to reduce outstanding borrowings  with operations funded through borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three secured lines of credit with various subsidiaries of the company and a term loan 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement associated with the acquisition of a business in  we can require the seller to adjust the purchase price for certain inventory remaining unsold as of july  we notified the seller that the adjustment of the purchase price exceeds the  balance of the subordinated note payable 
as of july   we suspended principal and interest payments on the note 
the seller has notified our bank lender that we were in default on the subordinated note 
our bank lender notified us that the default on the subordinated note caused us to be in default on one of its secured lines of credit in the amount of million 
however  we have entered into a forbearance agreement with our bank lender whereby the bank lender agreed to forebear taking any action on defaults under the million secured line of credit 
the bank lender can terminate the forbearance agreement at any time 
the million balance of the secured line of credit and the million balance of the subordinated note have been included in current maturities of long term debt at december  in our opinion  should the million secured line of credit be demanded upon termination of the forebearance agreement  we would be able to refinance the obligation or liquidate it through the proceeds from asset sales or property refinancing 
we intend to aggressively pursue our claims against the seller under the provisions of the asset purchase agreement 
the subordinated note provides for an interest rate of prime plus four percent if the note is in default 
we believe the subordinated note will either be paid off using funds obtained from the seller in settlement of our claims or the subordinated note will be offset against our claims 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in collecting the funds due under our claims or in offsetting the subordinated note against our claims 
subsequent to december   we amended the credit facility with our bank lender effective december   which now provides for borrowings up to an aggregate of the lesser of i a percentage of the collateral value based on a formula set forth therein or ii million  and matures april   except for the million secured line of credit which is in default and callable anytime under the forebearance agreement previously discussed 
interest accrues at prime plus on the revolving portion of the credit facility and prime plus on the term portion of the credit facility 
the prime rate at december   was 
the credit facility is secured by receivables  inventory  real estate and machinery and equipment 
the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as financial covenants that are measured monthly and require that we maintain a certain cash flow and other financial ratios 
in addition to the million of cash at december   after the bank lender waived compliance with certain financial ratios  we had million available for borrowings under the amended credit facility at december  from time to time we have not been in compliance with certain covenants under the credit facility  including the monthly minimum earnings requirement and the monthly fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were not in compliance with these covenants 
the lender has provided waivers to us regarding the compliance with these covenants through december   except for the million secured line of credit 
the lender also reduced the minimum monthly earnings requirement throughout we used cash in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to million in cash provided during this change between the two years is primarily attributable to accounts receivable and inventory declining in  thus providing cash versus accounts receivable and inventory increasing in  thus using cash 
fourth quarter sales were million below fourth quarter sales 
fourth quarter sales were million greater than fourth quarter sales 
these changes in sales trends account for the changes in the balances of inventory and receivables 
we generated cash through investing activities of approximately million during as compared to million in cash used in this increase was primarily attributed to the sales of certain of our fabrication and warehouse properties in houston  texas  for approximately million in cash 
we also had capital expenditures of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to million during the same period of capital expenditures during were related primarily to leasehold improvements associated with the relocation of two of our mro facilities million  computer equipment and the development of an e commerce website million which was subsequently written off 
capital expenditures during were primarily related to the purchase of furniture and fixtures and a telephone system million for our corporate headquarters as well as the purchase of computer equipment and software million 
our internal cash flow projections indicate our cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will meet our normal working capital needs during however  we will require additional debt or equity financing to meet our future debt service obligations  which may include additional bank debt or the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
in connection with such financing  we may be required to issue securities that substantially dilute the interest of our shareholders 
as described above  all of our credit facility matures on or before april  therefore  to keep amounts borrowed under the credit facility classified in our balance sheet as long term  we must comply with related covenants and renew and extend or replace the credit facility during however  we may not be able to renew and extend or replace the credit facility 
any extended or replacement facility may have higher interest costs  less borrowing capacity  more restrictive conditions and could involve equity dilution 
our ability to obtain a satisfactory credit facility may depend  in part  upon the level of our asset base for collateral purposes  our future financial performance and our ability to obtain additional equity 
we would require additional capital to fund any future acquisitions 
at this time  we do not plan to grow through acquisitions unless the market price of our common stock rises to levels that will make acquisition accretive to our earnings or we generate excess cash flow 
we also may pursue additional equity or debt financing to fund future acquisitions  although we may not be able to obtain additional financing on attractive terms 
accounting pronouncements on december   the united states securities and exchange commission sec staff released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  to provide guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we reviewed our revenue recognition procedures and are satisfied that we are in compliance with this sab 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities sfas no 

this statement requires the fair value of derivatives be recorded as assets or liabilities 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives would be accounted for currently in earnings or comprehensive income depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
sfas no 
 as amended  is effective for us beginning january  we adopted the statement effective january   there was no impact on our financial results as we were not a party to any derivative instruments 
in  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus on issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs and issue  accounting for certain sales incentives  collectively  the issues 
we adopted the issues in the fourth quarter of and have restated our quarterly and annual financial statements to conform to the requirements of the issues 
there was no effect on net income as a result of the adoption of the issues 
the net effect of the adoption of the issues was an increase in net sales of million  million and million  an increase in cost of sales of million  million and million  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  and a decrease in other income of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
inflation we do not believe the effects of inflation have any material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition and attempt to minimize inflationary trends by passing manufacturer price increases on to the customer whenever practicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk results from volatility in interest rates 
this risk is monitored and managed 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our debt portfolio 
to limit interest rate risk on borrowings  we target a portfolio within certain parameters for fixed and floating rate loans taking into consideration the interest rate environment and our forecasted cash flow 
this policy limits exposure to rising interest rates and allows us to benefit during periods of falling interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is generally limited to our credit facility
