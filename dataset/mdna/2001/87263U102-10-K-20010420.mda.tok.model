our actual results could be materially different from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
overview t r systems was founded in as an engineering services company providing consulting services to the printing  copying and multimedia markets 
in  we began development of our own products and in  we introduced the micropress  our digital document production management system 
since  we have continually improved the micropress by adding software functionality and device connectivity 
we have derived our revenue primarily from the sale of imaging systems and related add on software and hardware for the management  distribution and production of digital documents 
additionally  we receive or have received revenue from engineering services for the development of technology  the sale of consumable products  such as toner  and replacement parts that support our systems  customer service plans  fees for other customer services  such as training and product related consulting  and royalties for previously licensed technology 
imaging systems revenue is recognized based on the guidance in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from imaging systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the system has been shipped  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable 
under multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
our products do not require significant customization 
before the february  effective date of sop  we recognized revenue from imaging systems upon shipment 
the adoption of sop had no effect on our accounting for revenue 
engineering service fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the hours of work done on a project as a percent of the total estimated hours required to complete the project 
we recognize revenue from the sale of printing consumables upon shipment 
we recognize revenue from customer service plans ratably over the term of each plan  which is typically one to three years 
nonrefundable prepaid royalties are recognized as revenue over the term of the royalty agreement based on the greater of actual royalties earned or the straight line method 
revenue from royalties  which is included in service revenue  has been less than of total revenue in each of our last three fiscal years 
we distribute our products in north america and internationally through our distribution relationships with hitachi  ikon  kyocera mita  minolta  ricoh and toshiba  and as well as through a network of independent dealers 
we first sold products under the oem agreements with hitachi and minolta in fiscal we began selling products under our oem agreements with ikon  ricoh and toshiba in fiscal we also sold products to kyocera mita in fiscal sales shipped internationally were million  or of revenue  in fiscal we expect that sales shipped internationally will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
currently  all our sales are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive  which could result in a reduction in our sales in a particular country 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a million deferred income tax benefit in our results of operations 
additionally  we recognized a  deferred income tax asset for the tax benefits related to the exercise of employee stock options through a corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital 
these amounts represent the remainder of our net operating losses for income taxes and other deferred income assets  which had previously been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
in estimating the realizability of our million deferred tax assets  we consider both positive and negative evidence and give greater weight to evidence that is objectively verifiable 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not based on the level of current year taxable income  the absence of cumulative net operating losses for the past three years  anticipated future operating results and the amount and expiration dates of our net operating loss carryforwards 
at january   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards for income taxes which  if not utilized  expire beginning in through in prior periods  we concluded that the realization of our deferred tax assets was not more likely than not and fully offset our deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we record software development costs as required by financial accounting standards board statement no 
to date  we have expensed software development costs as incurred due to the immaterial amount of costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility and the time that the software is generally available for sale

net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended january   and revenue 
revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal revenue over fiscal revenue of million  or  was due primarily to an increase in imaging systems revenue 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in engineering services revenue 
the fiscal increase in revenue of million  or  was due to an increase in imaging systems revenue 
we derive imaging systems revenue from the shipment of digital document management and production systems as well as software  hardware and consumables related to those systems 
our imaging systems revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to shipments of products under our new oem relationships in fiscal during fiscal  we shipped products to ikon  kyocera mita  ricoh and toshiba in addition to hitachi and minolta  both of which also purchased products in fiscal the increase in imaging systems revenue from fiscal to fiscal of million  or  was primarily due to an increase in shipments under our oem relationships with minolta and hitachi 
the increase in shipments to minolta and hitachi in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in shipments to mita industrial 
shipments to mita industrial declined significantly after its reorganization proceedings 
during fiscal  we began shipping to mita industrial s successor  kyocera mita 
we recognize services revenue primarily from engineering service fees  customer service plans  training and product related consulting 
additionally  included in services revenue in fiscal and fiscal is revenue from royalties for previously licensed technology 
during fiscal  we recognized million in revenue from services  an increase of million over fiscal  primarily as a result of engineering service fees recognized for developing technologies to connect additional print devices of new and existing oems to the micropress

the decrease in services revenue from million in fiscal to million in fiscal was due to a decrease in revenue from royalties for previously licensed technology 
during fiscal  we derived million  or  of our total revenue from sales shipped internationally 
this compares to million  or of total revenue  in fiscal and million  or of total revenue  in fiscal domestic revenue as a percent of total revenue grew at a faster rate than international revenue in both fiscal and fiscal due to greater focus on the domestic market both by our oem customers and us through our independent resellers  as well as our more established domestic distribution infrastructure 
revenue from sales shipped internationally was derived from sales in asia  europe and canada in fiscal and fiscal with no one territory representing more than of total revenue 
fiscal revenue from sales shipped internationally was primarily generated by sales in asia through our oem relationship with mita industrial and from engineering service fees from minolta 
revenue from shipments to asia in fiscal represented of total revenue 
cost of imaging systems 
cost of imaging systems consists primarily of third party hardware  principally print devices  board components  finished boards and consumables  and third party software  as well as labor and overhead 
cost of imaging systems was million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal as compared to million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal and million  or of imaging systems revenue  in fiscal cost of imaging systems as a percent of imaging systems revenue decreased in both fiscal and fiscal due to an increase in oem imaging systems revenue as a percent of total imaging systems revenue 
we typically incur lower cost of imaging systems as a percent of sales on sales through our oem relationships than on sales through our independent resellers  as sales through our oem relationships typically contain less hardware than systems sold through our independent resellers 
we incur a higher cost of imaging systems as a percent of sales on the hardware that we sell than on the software that we sell 
the impact of the increase in oem revenue as a percent of total revenue in fiscal was partially offset by an increase in the cost of imaging systems as a percent of imaging systems revenue sold through our independent resellers  as well as an increase in labor and overhead in our product assembly operations

the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense of  on print devices used to develop connectivity with the micropress 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal of  was due to an increase in personnel related expenses as a result of the hiring of additional research and development personnel 
we believe that research and development spending  including spending for employee salaries and benefits  will increase in the future as we add connectivity to the micropress and further develop our software products

the deferred income tax benefit represents the remainder of our net operating losses for income taxes and other deferred income tax assets  which had previously been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded a current provision for alternative minimum income taxes of  we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal since we had a net loss in that year 
liquidity and capital resources from inception  we have funded our operations and investments in property and equipment primarily through the sale of equity securities 
in january  we completed our initial public offering and received million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs 
prior to our initial public offering  we funded our operations primarily through the private placement of preferred stock totaling about million 
we also obtained additional funding through the private placement of our common stock primarily with our founders  other employees and private investors

during fiscal  we received  from the sale of common stock under our employee stock plans 
we had no other sales of stock during fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal and  in fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was the result of million of net income recorded in fiscal  as well as an increase in accounts payable offset by an increase in deferred tax assets as a result of the recognition of the benefit of our remaining net operating loss carryforwards and increases in receivables and inventories as a result of the increase in our sales and cost of imaging systems between the two periods 
net cash used in operating activities increased in fiscal due to increases in receivables and inventories 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting purchases of property and equipment 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of spending on leasehold improvements and equipment for a newly leased operations and training center in norcross  georgia  and for the expansion of office space in our main office building 
the remaining increase was the result of purchases of equipment and software to aid in our research and development efforts  as well as to support the growth in our infrastructure 
in addition to our purchases of property and equipment in fiscal  we capitalized  in print devices received from our oem customers for partial payment of engineering service fees 
the fiscal total includes furniture and leasehold improvements purchased for our office space  which we moved into during fiscal  as well as spending on equipment used in product development and spending for trade show and demonstration equipment for the micropress 
we anticipate that we will continue spending on capital expenditures consistent with our growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel  although we have no plans for significant expenditures related to the expansion of our facilities in the current fiscal year 
we have a million secured revolving line of credit from a bank  which expires on october  there were no borrowings against this line of credit at january  or all borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at prime plus and are secured by our assets 
the line of credit requires the maintenance of various covenants  including a restriction on paying dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants at january  the agreement also provides for up to  in letters of credit 
any letters of credit issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the line 
in april  we issued a  letter of credit under this facility in connection with an operating lease obligation 
this letter of credit is reduced annually by at january   we had an unused  letter of credit from a bank under an additional credit facility 
both the letter of credit and the credit facility expire on january  as security for the letter of credit  we are required to maintain a certificate of deposit for  the certificate of deposit is classified as restricted cash 
net cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal and  in fiscal the net cash used in fiscal was the result of the settlement of a bank overdraft outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year along with the payment of additional costs from our initial public offering in fiscal these uses of cash in fiscal were offset by the proceeds from the sales of our common stock through our employee stock plans 
fiscal financing activities include our initial public offering as well as the private placement of  shares of series d preferred stock at per share in may we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion for the foreseeable future 
however  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements or if we determine to acquire any technology  we may be required to raise additional funds  through either debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
inflation has had no material impact on our operations to date 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
subsequently  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
and no 
and  as amended  is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including some derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 some contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative 
we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  effective february  the adoption of this statement did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations because we do not have any significant derivative instruments 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
b  is effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sab no 
in our fourth fiscal quarter and have determined that the effect of sab no 
is not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe our exposure to market rate fluctuations on our cash equivalents is minor due to the short term maturities of those investments  typically days or less 
we have market risk relating to borrowings under our credit facility because the interest rates under the facility are variable 
however  as of january   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales shipped internationally 
currently  all our sales shipped internationally are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive  which could result in a reduction in our sales in a particular country
