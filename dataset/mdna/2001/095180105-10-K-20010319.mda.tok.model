per share compared to net income of million 
per share before accounting for after tax merger and recapitalization costs of million 
per share and non recurring costs of million 
per share 
had the merger and recapitalization occurred on january   the net loss for reflecting the full year effect would have been million 
per share 
the results reflect increased sales and operating income from the outdoor products segment  lower sales and higher operating income in the industrial and power equipment segment  and reduced sales and operating income for the sporting equipment segment 
the improved results in the outdoor products segment is indicative of favorable market conditions including the effects of storm damage in europe  partially offset by the negative impact of the us dollar s strength on overseas sales 
the industrial and power equipment segment reflects the effects of plant rationalization actions taken in and the introduction of new products  partially offset by a downturn in market conditions during the sporting equipment segment was impacted by lower shipments in compared to which was in part attributable to increased consumer purchasing patterns late in in anticipation of yk 
corporate expenses in include million for the donation of art see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the expenses associated with the recapitalization and merger and the donation of art  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in from the decrease is the result of reduced corporate expenditures related to cost reduction actions and lower incentive compensation expenses  in addition to reduced selling expenses within the sporting equipment segment  partially offset by higher expenses within the outdoor products segment related to higher sales volumes 
higher interest expense for reflects higher long term debt levels during the current year resulting from the transaction highlighted in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective tax rate was higher in in comparison to  primarily the result of the non deductible portions of the merger and recapitalization expenses 
the principal reasons for these results and the status of the company s financial condition are set forth below 
sales in the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in operating income was million in compared to million in sales reflect a significantly higher volume of sales of chain saw components  particularly in europe and the united sates  with smaller increases in sales in other product lines as indicated in the table following in millions page increase decrease in chain saw components lawn mowers and accessories other total segment sales the improvement in operating income was primarily due to the higher sales of chain saw components  partially offset by higher lawn mower manufacturing costs 
operating income in compared to was negatively affected by an additional million from unfavorable foreign exchange 
sales for the sporting equipment segment declined to million in from million in this performance reflects lower sales of ammunition which was somewhat impacted by yk buying in and lower competitive selling prices on optical products in  partially offset by increased sales to law enforcement and international markets 
sales by the company s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in ammunition related products sports optical products other total segment sales operating income decreased to million in from million in the decrease is the result of lower ammunition volume and lower optics selling prices  partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses 
the company s industrial and power equipment segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the strength of the forestry industry in general  particularly in the company s most important market the southeastern united states  as well as the need to offer discounts in response to extremely aggressive competitive pricing for available sales 
segment sales in decreased to million from million as the market for forestry equipment weakened significantly in the second half of the year 
soft market conditions related to low wood prices  paper mill consolidations  higher fuel prices  and unfavorable weather conditions for a majority of the year  coupled with an overhang of used equipment in certain dealers inventories  continue to impact sales of new equipment 
sales of gear components and rotation bearings were essentially flat for the year as increased sales to the utility market were offset by decreases to the construction and forestry equipment markets 
sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions page increase decrease in timber harvesting and loading equipment gear components and rotation bearings total segment sales segment operating income was million  which compares to an operating loss of million in the improved operating income is primarily due to the inclusion of fabtek  which was acquired in september  and lower manufacturing costs than which included million related to the closure of two facilities partially offset by the impact of lower unit shipments 
market conditions were extremely weak in the fourth quarter of and resulted in a segment operating loss of million for the quarter in comparison to an operating profit of million in the fourth quarter of these market dynamics have continued into and management does not anticipate any significant improvement in the first half of the year 
if current market conditions were to continue  it would be unlikely this segment could achieve historical levels of sales and profitability 
the company s backlog decreased to million at december  from million at december  as follows in millions increase decrease in outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december sales for were million compared to million for operating income from segments for was million compared to million for for  income before extraordinary loss was million 
per share before accounting for after tax merger and recapitalization costs of million 
per share and non recurring costs of million 
per share 
this compares to income before extraordinary loss of million 
per share in these results reflect a significant reduction in sales and operating income from the industrial and power equipment segment due to adverse market conditions  manufacturing problems at the prentice facility which adversely impacted productivity and costs associated with the plant consolidation and realignment program  and improved results from the sporting equipment segment and outdoor products segment 
corporate expenses include a donation of art with a book value of million in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
merger and recapitalization expenses of million were incurred in compared to million in for a summary description of the merger and recapitalization  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the expense associated with the donation of art and merger and recapitalization expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in compared to these decreases reflect cost page reduction efforts at each segment and the corporate office 
higher interest expense for reflects higher long term debt levels during the current year resulting from the transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective income tax rate in reflects the donation of art and the non deductible portion of the expenses associated with the merger 
the principal reasons for these results and the status of the company s financial condition are set forth below 
sales of the outdoor products segment for were million compared to million in operating income was million in compared to million the prior year 
sales reflect a higher volume of sales of lawn mowers and accessories and from flat to slightly lower sales of other product lines as indicated in the following table in millions increase decrease in chain saw components lawn mowers and accessories other total segment sales the improvement in operating income is primarily due to the higher sales of lawn mowers and accessories and the positive effect of a favorable exchange rate in brazil which adds approximately million 
sales for the sporting equipment segment were up significantly to million in from million in operating income improved to million in from million in these results reflect a higher volume for ammunition and related components  sports optics and other products  partially offset by competitive pricing actions required during the last half of the current year in one of this segment s products 
sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in ammunition related products sports optical products other total segment sales additionally in the second half of  the sporting equipment segment completed certain cost reduction activities by consolidating its raw materials purchasing and sales and marketing organizations  transferring certain production to lower cost facilities and eliminating certain outsourcing 
annual savings of million from these efforts were realized in the company s industrial and power equipment segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the strength of the forestry industry in general 
a key indicator of this segment s market is the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp which declined from an average of per metric ton in the fourth quarter of to an average of per metric ton in per metric ton in the first quarter  per metric ton in page the second quarter  per metric ton in the third quarter and per metric ton in the fourth quarter  resulting in depressed market conditions characterized by significant sales declines in the company s most important market the southeastern united states and the need to offer discounts in response to extremely aggressive competition for available sales 
operating results of this segment were adversely affected by these poor market conditions in sales by the segment s principal product groups were as follows in millions increase decrease in timber harvesting and loading equipment gear components and rotation bearings total segment sales this segment incurred an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in primarily due to sharply reduced demand and manufacturing problems at the prentice facility which increased costs 
in response to weak market conditions and to improve capacity utilization  the company implemented a program of production consolidation and realignments in this segment to lower costs and improve productivity 
one manufacturing facility was closed during the first half of with its production shifted to other company plants 
another small facility was closed during the third quarter of with its production outsourced 
costs of approximately million related to these plant closings were charged to operations during financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december   as a result of the merger and recapitalization transactions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant amounts of debt  with interest payments on the notes and interest and principal payments under the new credit facilities representing significant obligations for the company 
the notes require semi annual interest payments and the term loan facilities under the new credit facilities require payments of principal of million annually through  million in  and million in interest on the term loan facilities and amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are payable in arrears according to varying interest periods 
the company s remaining liquidity needs relate to working capital needs  capital expenditures and potential acquisitions 
the company intends to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements through cash flows generated from operations and from the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has an availability of up to million 
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility which reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility were million at december  the revolving credit facility will mature august  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs  including financing for acquisitions  in the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be the case 
the company may also consider other options available to it in connection with future liquidity needs 
page the company has senior notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in the company also has senior subordinated notes outstanding in the principal amount of million which mature in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the terms and conditions of the senior notes  the senior subordinated notes  and the senior term loans 
the impact on earnings of the continued downturn in the forestry equipment markets raised questions as to whether the company would meet the covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios of the credit agreement for december  and for subsequent quarters 
as a result  the company sought and received see note of notes to consolidated financial statements from its lenders an amendment to its credit agreement 
as a result of the agreement  the company is in compliance with all the terms of the credit agreement 
in connection with the amendment  the company s principal shareholder  an affiliate of lehman brothers  inc  invested million in the form of a mezzanine security on march  cash balances at december   were million compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was principally due to increased net income of million  partially offset by higher working capital usage of million  a higher gain on disposal of property  plant  and equipment of million and an increase in deferred taxes of million 
working capital increased by million to million compared to million last year 
accounts receivable decreased by million  accounts payable decreased by million  and inventories increased by million 
the decline in accounts receivable reflects the significantly lower sales during the fourth quarter as compared to in the industrial and power equipment segment 
the inventory increase reflects million from acquisitions and million higher inventory within the industrial products segment  principally the result of reduced demand for equipment 
accounts payable declined in the fourth quarter from  principally due to reduced production volumes in december from a year ago 
accounts receivable at december   and december   and sales by segment for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of were as follows in millions december  december  increase decrease accounts receivable outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total segment receivables page three months ended december  december  increase decrease sales outdoor products sporting equipment industrial and power equipment total segment sales the company s outdoor products segment includes oregon cutting systems  frederick manufacturing  and dixon industries 
the higher sales by the outdoor products group and an increased mix of sales to original equipment manufacturers who generally require shorter payment terms  coupled with third party dealer financing offered by dixon  resulted in a decrease in that segment s receivables as compared to last year 
because of the seasonal nature of the sporting equipment business  the need to produce and ship efficiently in order to ensure an adequate supply during peak sales periods  and response to competitor programs  the company offers extended payment terms within its sporting equipment segment 
as a result  receivables tend to peak in september and reach their low point in january 
at december   extended term receivables were million higher than at december  and are the principal reason for the segment s overall increase in receivables 
the decrease in the industrial and power equipment sales revenues for the fourth quarter of the year is the principal reason for the decrease in receivables 
in response to market and competitive factors  the segment offers extended terms 
at december   there were approximately million in receivables with extended terms compared to million at december  cash used in investing activities in was million 
included in this amount is the acquisition of fabtek  windsor forestry  and estate cartridge for million 
purchases of property  plant  and equipment for the year were million and the sale of certain property  plant  and equipment  principally the company aircraft  was million 
the company has absorbed the increase in working capital and the acquisition of fabtek  windsor  and estate cartridge through operating cash flows and short term borrowings under its revolving credit agreement 
cash flow provided by financing activities for was million  substantially all from the utilization of the revolving credit activity 
the company expects the cash flow from operations and the amounts available under its revolving credit agreements will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital until market conditions improve in the industrial and power equipment segment and receivable terms return to those normally extended 
no material adverse effect on the operations  liquidity or capital resources of the company is expected as a result of the extended terms 
immediately after the merger and recapitalization transaction described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company became substantially leveraged which may adversely affect its operations 
this substantial leverage could have important consequences for the company  including the following the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired or may not be available on favorable terms  page a substantial portion of cash flows available from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest expense  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in net income and cash flows or an increase in expenses may make it difficult to meet debt service requirements or force the company to modify operations  and substantial leverage may make the company more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressure 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of expectations as regards to future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk the company manages its ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  the company has  on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and has entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december   no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term debt outstanding at december   by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt for a duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in under its credit agreement  the company was required to enter into hedge agreements within days of the borrowing and maintain such hedge agreements in place until the second anniversary of the borrowing  such that at least of the aggregate principal amount of the borrowings are subject to a fixed rate of interest 
the company has in place an interest rate cap at an immaterial cost to comply with this requirement 
foreign currency exchange risk approximately of oregon s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of oregon s reported sales and operating income 
historically  the company s principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and local currency sales in europe principally france and germany 
during the past three years  the company has not used derivatives to manage any significant foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
commodity price risk during  the company purchased approximately million pounds of brass for use in its sporting equipment operations 
while the company has in previous years hedged approximately of these purchases and may in future years hedge these purchases if the price trend is such that it could have a material effect on financial condition or results of operations  no futures contracts to manage page this price risk were entered into in because there are no copper and zinc contracts outstanding at december   an immediate hypothetical decrease in the futures prices of copper and zinc would have no effect on fair value 
in addition  a large quantity of other metals principally lead were purchased by sporting equipment operations in derivatives were not used to manage this price risk 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  as amended in june by sfas sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts

sfas  as amended by sfas  was effective for the company beginning january  certain instruments historically utilized by the company to hedge raw materials and interest rate risks are required to be marked to market each period under this standard 
the adoption of sfas  as amended by sfas  has not had a material impact on the results of operations 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no
