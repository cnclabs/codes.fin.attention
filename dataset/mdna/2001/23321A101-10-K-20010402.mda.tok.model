see introductory note on page hereof 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the subsection entitled additional factors that may affect future operating results and the market price of our stock in item above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
results of operations net sales 
we had net sales of  in   in and  in the decrease in net sales in as compared to was due in part to one of our major customers changing their focus from selling integrated storage solutions  which included the disc product line as a major component  to software only sales 
in addition  although units sales in remained relatively flat as compared to  our average selling price decreased due to a shift in the product mix towards our lower priced units 
also  the units sold in generally had fewer media slots  and our revenue from the sale of media decreased 
our traditional customers moved to purchasing lower end units because the storage capacity is greater than the capacity of lower end units in prior years because of technological improvements 
in response to the decline in demand in our traditional markets  we are pursuing new markets  including corporate environments requiring nearline solutions 
we believe that these new markets have a growing requirement for the high capacity nearline storage solutions that we offer 
in  the number of units sold was relatively flat as compared to as customers deferred spending on new information storage systems while they completed their year testing activities 
the increase in net sales in as compared to was primarily due to our renewed emphasis on selling media along with our products 
the general sales cycles for distribution of our products are similar to those of most businesses selling products designed for use as part of large systems  and range from three to six months for value added resellers var and small system integrators and from one to two years for original equipment manufacturers oem  product integrators and large system integrators 
cost of sales 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  was approximately in  in and in our relatively low gross margins reflect our low sales volumes  which have resulted in unabsorbed manufacturing costs and high costs of materials due to the inability to achieve purchasing economies of scale due to low sales volume 
if we are able to increase sales  then we expect costs of sales per unit of product will decrease because fixed manufacturing costs will be distributed over the larger sales volume  and material costs will decrease as the result of volume purchases 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in   in and  in although expenses remained relatively flat in as compared to  expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in headcount due to attrition 
we believe that research and development expenses will increase moderately in due to current projects under development 
marketing and sales expenses 
marketing and sales expenses were  in   in and  in expenses increased in as compared to primarily due to an increase in head count 
expenses increased in as compared to primarily due to increased participation in industry trade shows 
we believe that in marketing and sales expenses will increase in connection with our continued efforts to broaden market acceptance of our products 
in particular  we intend to increase our sales force and increase our spending on market awareness activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses have remained relatively flat and were  in   in and  we believe that general and administrative expenses continue to remain relatively flat during liquidity and capital resources during  and  we used cash of   and  respectively  primarily to fund operating losses 
in fiscal  we raised  through the issuance of convertible preferred stock 
at december   we had a cash balance of approximately  in addition  we have a commitment from our largest investor to invest up to  if needed 
we believe this committed future investment  together with borrowing from a factoring agreement with a financial institution  which allows it to borrow the lesser of  or of eligible receivables  and cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements at least through the end of  although we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
the ability to sustain our operations for a significant period after december  will depend on our ability to significantly increase sales or raise significant additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us 
there is no assurance that any of these conditions will be achieved 
in particular  we expect to require increasing amounts of cash to finance our efforts to increase sales  which we plan to achieve by increasing selling efforts to large system integrators and oems  by hiring additional sales and sales support staff and by making evaluation units available 
in addition  we intend to expand our current network of resellers 
we may require cash to finance purchases of inventory to satisfy anticipated increased sales as our products achieve market acceptance 
although we have not committed to make any material capital expenditures as of december   our budget for capital equipment expenditures for is approximately  the majority of these purchases are expected to be in the areas of process and molding tooling to reduce cost and improve producibility of our products 
the terms of the series c preferred stock and outstanding warrants may limit the availability of financing for us  particularly equity financing  because of the superior preferences of the series c preferred stock and the potential dilutive effect of the outstanding warrants 
holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends in the amount of approximately  per year 
when and if declared 
we have never paid cash dividends and have no present plans to pay dividends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to significant market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates as we are not expected to have a significant investment portfolio in fiscal in addition  we do not use derivative financial instruments of any kind and currently all of our transactions are in us currency
