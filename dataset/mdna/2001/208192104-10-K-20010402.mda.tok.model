item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes filed with this report 
overview we currently market three pharmaceutical products 
in may  the fda granted us clearance to market olux tm foam clobetasol propionate  for the treatment of moderate to severe scalp dermatoses 
we launched olux on november  our commercial business is focused on the dermatology marketplace  which is characterized by a large patient population that is served by relatively small  and therefore more accessible  groups of treating physicians 
we are offering two dermatology products with clinically proven therapeutic advantages and are providing quality customer service to physicians through our experienced sales and marketing staff 
we also sell ridaura  a product to treat rheumatoid arthritis 
in addition to our commercial business  we are developing a biotechnology product that has the potential to treat multiple diseases 
our product is a recombinant form of a natural hormone called relaxin 
relaxin reduces the hardening  or fibrosis  of skin and organ tissue  dilates existing blood vessels and stimulates new blood vessel growth 
we currently have clinical trials underway with relaxin for infertility 
we intend to develop relaxin for other indications 
on october   we announced that our pivotal trial for relaxin for the treatment of scleroderma failed to reach its primary endpoint 
we have discontinued our development program related to relaxin for scleroderma 
we are in earlier stage clinical trials of relaxin for the treatment of infertility and peripheral arterial disease 
we maintain north american rights for relaxin and have entered into collaborative relationships for this program for markets outside of the united states 
in october  our partners in japan and europe notified us that they would terminate our relaxin development agreements with them in accordance with the termination provisions of the respective agreements and as of december   we have no further development obligations under either agreement 
consequently  the rights for relaxin in japan have reverted to us  and the european rights will revert to us in april results of operations revenues years ended december  in thousands product luxiq   ridaura    actimmune   olux  total product revenues    license medeva celltech   intermune  suntory   paladin labs immune response faulding total license revenues    total revenues    our product revenues in were million compared to million in and million in the increase in total product sales in was due to continued sales growth of luxiq r foam betamethasone valerate   which we began marketing in april  and the launch of olux in november although ridaura sales increased year to year  we believe that ridaura will experience decreased sales due to competition from new and existing products 
beginning with the second quarter of  in connection with our agreement with intermune  we sold our remaining actimmune product rights  effective april  the increase in total product sales in over was due to sales of actimmune  which we began shipping in february  and luxiq  which we launched in april this increase was partially offset by lower sales of ridaura 
license revenues were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in license revenues for over includes million paid by intermune in connection with our sublicense agreement  million in connection with the sale of actimmune product rights to intermune  million related to revenue recognized in which had been deferred january  in connection with the change in accounting principle in accordance with sab  and a one time million milestone payment from celltech in connection with our collaboration agreement for the development of relaxin before medeva gave notice of termination of the contract in october in  we recorded million in license revenue million of a license fee and million for quarterly reimbursements of product development costs in connection with our agreement with medeva in relation to the development of relaxin 
in addition  we recorded million for a milestone payment made by suntory  and million for a license fee paid by paladin labs 
payments made by suntory and paladin labs are associated with collaboration agreements for relaxin 
the million license revenue recorded in was for a license fee paid by suntory under the collaboration agreement for relaxin 
also in  we recorded million for a license fee associated with intermune and million license fee for the assignment of patent rights to the immune response corporation 
we expect license revenue to fluctuate significantly depending on when and whether we or our partners achieve milestones under existing agreements  and on new business opportunities that we may identify 
intermune purchased the remaining united states commercial rights and revenue rights to actimmune effective april  as part of the transaction  intermune paid million which included the prepayment of a million obligation owed in prior to this transaction  connetics had retained rights to actimmune revenue based on a fixed amount of unit sales in the years  and beginning with the quarter ended june   intermune has purchased all of our remaining product rights to actimmune 
cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the costs of luxiq  ridaura  actimmune until april  and olux  royalty payments on these products based on a percentage of our product revenues and product freight and distribution costs from cord 
we recorded cost of product revenues of million compared to million in and million in the decrease in cost of product revenues from to is primarily due to discontinued sales of actimmune effective april  actimmune cost more to manufacture and produce than our other products do 
the increase in cost of product revenues in over was primarily due to costs associated with the sales of luxiq and actimmune  which we began marketing in  and higher product and royalty costs 
license amortization the expenses associated with the acquisition of product rights to ridaura were fully amortized by december  accordingly  we did not record any amortization expense in we recorded amortization expense of million in associated with the acquisition of product rights to ridaura  compared to million in the decrease of million amortization expense in compared to was the result of the asset being fully amortized by the end of november eleven months compared to a full year amortization in research and development research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in in  our research and development expenses consisted of manufacturing scale up of relaxin  conducting a phase ii iii trial of relaxin for the treatment of scleroderma  increasing personnel in our organization  and expenses associated with the initiation of clinical trials of relaxin 
research and development expenses for were consistent in nature with those recognized in the increase in research and development expenses in over was due to the commencement of manufacturing scale up of relaxin  which accounted for approximately of the increase  conducting a phase ii iii trial of relaxin for the treatment of scleroderma in  increasing personnel in our development organization  and initiation of clinical trials of relaxin for the treatment of infertility 
we expect research and development expenses to remain at the same level for the next few quarters  due to relaxin clinical trial activities for new disease indications  preclinical activities associated with technologies acquired from soltec  pre manufacturing start up costs associated with qualifying a new supplier for olux  ongoing expenses related to relaxin manufacturing  and possible acquisitions of new technologies and products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in was primarily due to expenses associated with launching olux in the fourth quarter of  and increases in the number of personnel in our sales and marketing and clinical organizations 
the increase in expenses from over was due to the following factors the increase in our sales and marketing staff compared to the same period in  expenses associated with the market launch of luxiq  co promotion fees for luxiq and ridaura  and stock compensation related expenses 
charge for in process research and development there were no license fee charges in in we recorded a million license fee charge in connection with our december licensing agreement with soltec for exclusive rights to certain applications of a broad range of unique topical delivery technologies 
in  we recorded a million non cash license fee charge associated with our interferon gamma license agreement with genentech 
we determined that it was highly uncertain whether the amount paid for these two licenses would be realized  as they relate to pre fda approved products and are dependent on additional research and development and do not have alternative future uses 
consequently  we expensed the full purchase amounts 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  were million for  compared with million in  and million in the increase in interest and other income in over was due to realized gains of million from the sale of marketable securities and higher interest income from higher cash and short term investment balances 
the increase in interest income in compared to was due to a higher investment balance as a result of receiving a total of million from our corporate partnership arrangements and net proceeds of approximately million through a public offering of our common stock in october cash received in was offset in part by cash used in operations and payment of debt obligations  including payments of approximately million of principal and interest to glaxosmithkline for rights to ridaura and million principal and interest payments for a bank loan 
interest expense was million in  compared with million in  and million in the decrease in interest expense in from resulted from lower interest expense associated with lower balances outstanding for obligations under capital leases  and a note payable 
the decrease in interest expense in from was the result of lower balances for obligations under capital leases and loans  and notes payable 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  compared to zero in and the reason for the increase in income tax expense in compared to is that we recorded pre tax income in as compared to net losses in and our results for reflect a gain of million on the sale of securities in for a more complete description of our income tax position  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
net income loss in  we had net income of million  compared to net losses of million in and million in the net income in compared to the net loss in was primarily attributable to the following a million gain on the sale of common stock of intermune  increased product revenues in compared to  no product amortization charges related to the acquisition of ridaura in as compared to a charge of million in  a one time million milestone payment and million of quarterly development reimbursement from celltech in connection with our collaboration agreement for the development of relaxin  and the sale effective april  of our remaining actimmune product rights for million to intermune and a one time payment of million in connection with our exclusive sublicense agreement with intermune 
the increase in net loss in from was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in development activities related primarily to relaxin  increasing personnel in the sales and marketing organization  expenses associated with the launch of luxiq  million licensing charge in connection with the license of delivery technologies from soltec  stock compensation related expenses  and co promotion fees for luxiq and ridaura 
these costs were offset in part by a million increase in product and contract revenues  and million increase in net interest and other income 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
these losses are expected to fluctuate from period to period based on timing of product revenues  clinical material purchases  clinical trial expenses  and possible acquisitions of new products and technologies 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through proceeds from equity financings  sale of investments  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners and bank loans 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at december   and accounts receivable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  our cash balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including high grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared with million in and million in net income of million for was affected by the gain on sale of intermune stock of million and non cash charges of million of depreciation and amortization expense and million non cash compensation expense 
the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows was due to the decrease in accrued and other current liabilities 
net loss of million for was affected by non cash charges of million depreciation and amortization expense and million deferred compensation expense 
cash outflow for was primarily for operating activities  including growth in inventory due primarily to carrying three products  and increases in accounts receivable due to higher product sales 
cash usage was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to higher development  sales and marketing expenses 
the net loss was affected by a number of charges that did not use cash  including a million charge for the write off of technology licensed in exchange for common stock  million of amortization expense and million of imputed interest expense associated with the acquisition of ridaura 
cash outflow for was primarily for operating activities and approximately million in principal and interest payments to glaxosmithkline 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared with cash used in investing activities of million in and million in the increase in cash from investing activities in was primarily related to million of proceeds from the sale of shares of intermune stock 
cash outlays in were due to equipment expenditures required for operations 
cash outlays in were due to leasehold improvements and equipment expenditures required for operations 
cash outlays in included million for equipment expenditures required for operations and million for fulfillment of obligations under the equity and asset purchase agreements with glaxosmithkline 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in included million of cash proceeds from the issuance of stock  offset by million of note and lease payments 
of the million of cash proceeds  million relates to a private placement of  shares of connetics unregistered common stock 
financing activities in included the receipt of proceeds of million from the sale of common stock to celltech and paladin labs  and million in a public offering of our common stock 
this was offset in part by a million principal payment to glaxosmithkline for obligations under a promissory note in connection with the ridaura acquisition  million pay down on a bank loan and million in payments under capital leases and loans 
in we raised million through private sales of our common stock and obtained million through a bank loan  offset in part by million in payments on obligations under capital leases and loans and principal payments of million to glaxosmithkline 
working capital 
working capital increased to million at december   from million at december  the increase in working capital was due to a million private placement of our common stock and the million sale of actimmune rights to intermune and the million of proceeds from the sale of stock of intermune  partially offset by cash used for operations 
the increase in working capital in compared to was due to proceeds from our public offering of common stock and payments received from our corporate partnering arrangements  offset in part by our use of cash in operations  higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased development  sales and marketing expenses  and payment of debt obligations 
as of december   we had million in future obligations for non cancelable operating leases  which are to be paid in we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash generated from product sales and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish other collaborative arrangements  the level of product revenues  the possible acquisition of new products and technologies and the development of commercialization activities 
therefore such capital uses and requirements may increase in future periods 
as a result  we may require additional funds prior to reaching profitability and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our other products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we are required to adopt sfas effective january  because we do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in hedging activities  we do not believe that adopting sfas will have and impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect forward looking statements a wide range of factors could materially affect our future developments and performance  including the following we have a limited operating history and are subject to the uncertainties and risks associated with any new business 
we have experienced operating losses every year since our incorporation and expect to incur additional losses for at least the next few years 
losses are expected to fluctuate from period to period based on timing of product revenues  clinical material purchases  possible acquisitions of new products and technologies  scale up activities and clinical activities 
therefore  the time for us to reach profitability is uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will ever be able to generate revenue from our products now under development or achieve profitability on a sustained basis 
there are risks related to the management of the marketing and sales of our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively manage the distribution of our products and to market and sell our products successfully 
if luxiq and olux do not sustain market acceptance  our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
future revenues from sales are uncertain as we are subject to patent risks and competition from new products 
our products for research  preclinical testing and sale have been supplied by collaborators and contract manufacturing companies 
we currently have no manufacturing facilities nor do we intend to develop such capabilities in the near future 
the failure of any of our contract manufacturers to provide products for clinical testing or to manufacture products on a commercial scale on a timely basis will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to uncertainties associated with product development and market acceptance 
several of our products are in clinical or preclinical development 
there can be no assurance that products under development will be safe and effective  approved by the fda  produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs or will gain satisfactory market acceptance 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including costs associated with the research  development  clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals of products in our pipeline  enforcing patent claims and intellectual property rights  acquisition of new products and technologies  commercialization activities and the ability to establish collaborative arrangements 
such requirements may increase in the future and we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements or from other sources 
future financings could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
a key element of our strategy is to in license or acquire additional marketed or late stage development products  which involve risks 
a portion of the funds needed to acquire  develop and market any new products may come from our existing cash  which will result in fewer resources available to our current products and clinical programs 
we may also have to recruit additional qualified employees to manage the development  marketing  sale and distribution of newly acquired products 
we cannot assure you that newly acquired products will achieve the marketing or therapeutic success expected of them by us  industry analysts or others at the time of acquisition 
our success will depend in part on our ability to preserve our trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  and to obtain patent protection for our products and processes 
products or processes made  used or sold by us may be covered by patents held by third parties that could prevent us from practicing the subject matter  require us to obtain licenses or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
the patent positions can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
accordingly  the breadth of such claims cannot be predicted 
patent disputes are frequent and we could in the future be involved in material patent litigation 
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward looking statements is illustrative  but by no means exhaustive 
accordingly  all forward looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty 
our business strategy may cause fluctuating operating results our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year depending upon the relative timing of events or uncertainties which may arise 
for example  the following events or occurrences could cause fluctuations in our financial performance from period to period changes in the levels we spend to develop new product lines changes in the amount we spend to promote our products changes in treatment practices of physicians that currently prescribe our products changes in reimbursement policies of health plans and other similar health insurers  including changes that affect newly developed or newly acquired products increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products the development of new competitive products by others the mix of products that we sell during any time period our responses to price competition forward buying patterns by wholesalers that may result in significant quarterly swings in revenue reporting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of securities that may include us corporate debt  us government debt  and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  in thousands total fair value available for sale securities    weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
we make payments to ccl pharmaceuticals for the production of luxiq and olux in pounds sterling  and to boehringer ingelheim for the production of relaxin in austrian schillings 
if the us dollar depreciates against the schilling or the pound  the payments that we must make will increase  which will increase our expenses 
we have a bank loan that is sensitive to movement in interest rates 
interest income from our investments is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we face minimal material market risk exposure
