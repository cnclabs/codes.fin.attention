fiscal year ended february net revenues for the year ended march  decreased by to  million from  million for the year ended february  net revenues decreased due to the discontinuations of several non core businesses  related product lines and the restructuring of the compaq relationship 
in addition  revenues of the company s non core legacy products decreased as the company s transformation continued and the company focused on selling products and services related to the ongoing businesses of the four operating subsidiaries 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its dnpg business and most of the company s non core legacy products 
net revenues within the united states domestic decreased million or to million or of total net revenues for fiscal from million or of total net revenues for fiscal net revenues in europe decreased million or to million or of total net revenues for fiscal from million or of total net revenues for fiscal net revenues within pacific rim increased million or to million or of total net revenues for fiscal from million or of total net revenues for fiscal net revenues within other regions increased million or to million or of total net revenues for fiscal from million or of total net revenues for fiscal total segment net revenues of enterasys were million and million fiscal years and  respectively  representing an increase of million or from fiscal year to the increases in net revenues were primarily due to increased revenues of multi layer switching products  wireless and security products 
total segment net revenues of riverstone were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  representing an increase of million or from fiscal year to the increases in net revenues were primarily due to the addition of new telecommunications service provider customers both in the united states and internationally 
total segment net revenues of aprisma were million  and million in fiscal years and  respectively  representing an increase of million or from fiscal year to the increase in revenues of aprisma products was attributable to increased revenues to new service provider and enterprise customers  continued penetration of current service provider and enterprise customers in aprisma s target markets as well as the expansion of aprisma product line capabilities to manage the latest generation optical and broadband networking equipment in the optical and metro aggregation markets 
in addition  aprisma s product line capabilities expansion included the integration and management of multi vendor security devices and applications 
total segment net revenues of gnts were million and million in fiscal years and respectively  representing an increase of million or from fiscal year to the increase in net revenues was primarily due to the addition of new professional service customers both in the united states and internationally 
total other net revenues of cabletron s non core legacy and discontinued products decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to net revenues of million in fiscal the decrease in revenues of non core legacy and discontinued products was principally due to the discontinuations of the dnpg and netvantage product lines  as well as lower revenues of other non core legacy products 
gross margin  expenses and interest income gross margin of enterasys products increased million or to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the increase in gross margin is primarily related to the increase in net revenues and is also attributable to overall cost savings as a result of outsourcing manufacturing 
gross margin of riverstone products increased million or to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the improvements in gross margins are primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues and economies of scale achieved from increased net revenues 
gross margin of aprisma products increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the increase in gross margin was due to increased revenues of spectrum licenses  an improved revenue mix of higher margin core products compared to lower margin third party products and the execution and implementation of oem agreements resulting in improved margins 
gross margin of gnts services increased million or to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the improvements in gross margins are primarily attributable to increased net revenues 
gross margin of cabletron non core legacy and discontinued products decreased million to a loss of million  or or net revenues  in fiscal year compared to million  or of net revenues  in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins is primarily attributable to decreased net revenues associated with products that the company discontinued  sales returns  and pricing allowances 
research and development r d expenses in the year ended march  decreased to million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  r d decreased in accordance with prior restructuring initiatives and refocused efforts on core projects identified in the restructuring initiative 
the company plans to continue to develop new products through a combination of internal development efforts and acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net revenues  in the year ended march  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenues was primarily a result of increased professional fees  consulting fees and asset impairments that were incurred as a result of the transformation of the company 
amortization of intangible assets expense was million  or of net revenues  in the year ended march  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  the change in amortization expense was primarily a result of the acquisition of indus river and the divestiture of dnpg both of which were completed during the year ended march  stock based compensation expense in the year ended march  was million  million was amortized related to stock options granted with exercise prices below fair market value on the date of grant and million was amortized related to stock issued that was contingent on future services in connection with the company s acquisition of nsw 
the company expects to recognize future quarterly charges of million per quarter during each of the next eight quarters followed by million per quarter during each of the subsequent eight quarters  in connection with these grants 
an additional million was related to stock options granted to consultants 
as the majority of these options have been fully vested and the related services have been performed  the company does not expect any significant future compensation expenses associated with these options granted to consultants 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a special charge of million related to the restructuring initiative undertaken during may in connection wth the company s transformation 
the special charges consisted of million related to asset impairments  million related to severance benefits and million related to exit costs 
these charges reflect the expected sale of an office building in rochester  nh  exit costs associated with the planned closure of sales offices worldwide of which were closed as of march   the write off of certain assets that were not required subsequent to the transformation of the company and the planned reduction of approximately individuals from the company s global workforce 
the reduction in the global workforce involved principally sales  engineering and administrative personnel and has also included targeted reductions impacting most functions within the company 
the exit costs which the company expects to incur relate primarily to long term lease commitments 
this initiative is intended to establish the proper sizing of the transformed company and to align the revenue opportunities with cost models 
as of march   employees have been terminated in accordance with the plan 
in the year ended march   the company recorded million of special charges 
these special charges consisted of million of in process research and development costs related to the acquisition of indus river and a million charge taken in connection with a restructuring initiative that resulted from the company s transformation offset by a million adjustment to the prior year restructuring 
in the year ended february   the company recorded million of special charges for the restructuring initiative undertaken during march these charges reflect the closure of the company s manufacturing facility in ohio  the planned closure of sales offices worldwide sales offices were closed  the consolidation and outsourcing of various manufacturing operations  the write off of certain assets that were not required subsequent to the restructuring and the planned reduction of approximately  individuals from the company s global workforce individuals were terminated in accordance with the initiative 
the reduction in the global workforce was principally manufacturing and distribution personnel but also included targeted reductions impacting most functions within the company 
the exit costs which the company expects to incur relate primarily to long term lease commitments which will be paid out over a few years 
this initiative was intended to reduce the expense structure of the company  reduce cost of goods sold  increase cash reserves  provide higher return on assets and revenue per employee  enable aggressive asset reduction and consolidation initiatives and increase net income 
these actions were completed prior to june  there is no assurance that the company will achieve the intended benefits of the restructuring initiative 
the benefits are subject to numerous risks that could impair the company s ability to realize the expected benefits when expected  or ever 
enterasys income from operations increased million to income of million in fiscal year compared to a loss of million in fiscal year this increase was due principally to increased gross margins and reduced r d expenses 
riverstone s loss from operations decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this increase was due principally to increased gross margins being offset by higher operating expenses as riverstone developed its own infrastructure apart from cabletron and to increased spending in r d and selling expenses 
aprisma s loss from operations decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to a loss of million in fiscal year the additional loss was principally due to increased sales and marketing expenses including an increase in the number of direct sales people 
gnts loss from operations increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to higher gross margins being offset by increased operating expenses 
the other segment s loss from operations increased million to million in fiscal year compared to income from operations of million in fiscal year the change was principally due to discontinuations of non core product lines and the sale of dnpg 
net interest income in the year ended march  was million compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in net interest income in the year ended march  as compared to the year ended february  was due to higher interest rates and higher average invested balances 
net other expense in the year ended march  was million 
of this total million relates to write down of marketable and non marketable securities to their expected realizable value  recognition of million of deferred gain relating to the efficient transaction  million loss on the sale of marketable and non marketable securities  million loss on the disposal of the dnpg business and million of other non operating expenses 
net other income in the year ended february  was million 
of this total million relates to the realized gain from the sale of a subsidiary  flowpoint  million relates to the restructuring of the company s relationship with compaq and million relates to the sales of corporate equities

in the year ended february   the company recorded million of net other income and a million restructuring charge 
income tax expense benefit the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended march  compared to for the year ended february  the income tax benefit was million for the year ended march  compared to an income tax expense of million in the year ended february  the tax benefit for the year ended march  included a non deductible in process research and development charge and million charge for the write down of certain deferred tax assets  which in management s opinion are not likely to be realized 
the tax expense for the year ended february  included other income items  which in total  were taxed at higher tax rates than normal operating income and expenses 
the year ended february  income tax expense included a million tax charge related to the sale of flowpoint  a million tax charge related to the compaq alliance agreement  a million tax benefit related to the amortization of purchased acquisition costs  a million tax benefit related to the write off of product lines and a million tax benefit related to the manufacturing divestiture 
results of the fiscal year ended february  vs 
fiscal year ended february  net revenues for the year ended february  increased by to  million from  million for the year ended february  net revenues increased primarily as a result of increased revenues of the company s layer and layer switched technology products 
worldwide revenues of switched products increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in revenues of switched products was principally due to an increase in revenues of the company s switch router products  which offset declining revenues of older switched products 
the increase has been as a result of the company s success in penetrating the wan segment of the layer switching market  creation of layer switching technology products and continuation of customers migrating from the older shared media technology products 
secondarily  revenues increased as a result of increased revenues to compaq in connection with the transition from an oem agreement between compaq and the company  with minimum purchase commitments  to an alliance agreement 
as part of this transition  compaq purchased million million in the fourth quarter of fiscal of existing inventory that was in the company s manufacturing pipeline and paid the company million as a pricing rebate for compaq s failure to meet its minimum purchase commitments in the year ended february  revenues of shared media products decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  from million in the year ended february  revenues of shared media products steadily decreased throughout the years ended february  and february  as a result of both declining unit shipments and lower prices per product 
revenues of spectrum and other miscellaneous products increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  this increase was largely a result of customers purchasing older miscellaneous products that enable them to maintain their existing systems 
revenues from professional services and maintenance remained relatively flat at approximately million in the year ended february  and million in the year ended february  net revenues within the united states in the year ended february  were million or of net revenues  compared to million or of net revenues in the year ended february  domestic net revenues increased in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   largely due to revenues of switched media products increasing by more than domestically and revenues of products in the company s manufacturing pipeline to compaq 
net revenues in europe were million or of total net revenues in the year ended february  compared to million or of total net revenues in the year ended february  the decrease in revenues was a result of decreases across a majority of the product lines  including a million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   decrease in shared media products and a million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   decrease in revenues of switched products 
revenues decreased in the year ended february  compared to february  as revenues of dnpg compaq products began to decline 
net revenues in the pacific rim pac rim were million or of total net revenues in the year ended february  compared to million or of total net revenues in the year ended february  revenues of switched products increased million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february   but were offset by decreases in revenues across a majority of the product lines  including a million  or  decrease in service revenues 
net revenues in other regions were million  or  of total net revenues in the year ended february  compared to million  or  of total net revenues in the year ended february  revenues of switched products increased million  or  from the year ended february  to the year ended february  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on the company s operating results in the periods presented 
gross margin was million  or  in the year ended february  compared to million  or  in the year ended february  the improvement in gross margin during the year ended february   as compared to the year ended february   reflects lower materials costs associated with streamlined product offerings 
research and development r d expenses in the year ended february  decreased to million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  r d decreased  in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february  as a result of the elimination of staff and facilities from various r d departments and refocused efforts on core projects identified in the restructuring initiative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  the decrease in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net revenues in the year ended february  compared to the year ended february   was primarily a result of reductions in sales offices  staff and the writeoff of fixed assets 
amortization of intangible assets expenses were million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  compared to million  or of net revenues  in the year ended february  the change in amortization expense was a result of acquisitions  that were completed during the year ended february   having a full year s worth of amortization expense 
special charges were million in the year ended february  compared to million in the year ended february  in the year ended february   the million of special charges were taken for a restructuring initiative undertaken in connection with the company s decision to outsource its manufacturing operations 
in the year ended february   special charges were taken for in process research and development related to the acquisition of yago systems  inc million  ariel million  flowpoint million and netvantage million 
net interest income for the year ended february  was million compared to million in the year ended february  the increase in net interest income in the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  was due to a significant increase in cash  resulting from the sale of an equity investment near the end of fiscal income loss before income taxes the improvement from a loss before income taxes  in the year ended february   to income before income taxes  in the year ended february   was primarily due to the company s sale of its flowpoint subsidiary and income related to its restructured relationship with compaq as well as higher gross profit margins and lower operating expenses 
the increase in loss before taxes in the year ended february  was due to lower gross profit margins as the company continued its migration from shared media products to switched products and higher personnel costs in r d departments  which more than offset the decrease in special charges 
income tax expense benefit the company s effective tax rate was for the year ended february  compared to for the year ended february  the income tax expense of milllion in the year ended february  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the year ended february  the tax benefit for the year ended february  included large non deductible in process research and development charges and acquisition costs and tax benefits related to the ariel acquisition  fixed asset loss and losses from operations  which produced a higher tax rate than normal operating income and expenses 
the year ended february  income tax benefit included a million tax benefit related to the acquisition of ariel and a million tax benefit related to the fixed asset loss 
business combinations fiscal year acquisitions on january   cabletron acquired indus river  a designer and marketer of virtual private networks for enterprise class customers 
in connection with the acquisition  cabletron issued  shares of cabletron common stock and  shares of cabletron series c preferred stock to the shareholders of indus river in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of stock of indus river 
in addition  cabletron assumed outstanding options to purchase indus river stock  which options were converted into options to purchase  shares of its common stock and  shares of its series c preferred stock 
cabletron also assumed outstanding warrants to purchase indus river stock  which warrants were converted into warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock and shares of its series c preferred stock 
the company has recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of million 
this acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research development 
accordingly  the company recorded an expense of million for this in process research and development 
the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired of million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets and is being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of years 
the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of indus river from the acquisition date 
cabletron also issued stock options in connection with the acquisition of indus river 
the company calculated the intrinsic value of the unvested stock options as of the consummation date of the merger  and as a result recorded approximately million of unearned stock based compensation for the value of the options 
the company incurred approximately million of compensation expense as earned during fiscal year in connection with our acquisition of indus river networks  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value of these projects based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of the acquisition  these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date 
we used an independent third party appraiser to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the values assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with indus river networks enterprise class virtual private network technologies 
the percentage of completion method was utilized for the valuation procedures 
the percentage complete was determined based on a ratio of completed project engineer hours to total estimated engineer hours required to complete the project 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met design specifications  including functional  technical and economic performance requirements 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
in the model used to value this in process research and development  total revenues attributable to indus river networks were projected to exceed million within five years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major research and development efforts 
as of the valuation date  it was determined that riverworks  the existing product of indus river networks  would generate revenues through end of fiscal  with million in that year and million in fiscal the estimated revenues for the products resulting from in process research and development were projected to peak at approximately million in fiscal and then decline as other new products and technologies were projected to enter the market 
our cost of sales was estimated based on internal projections generated by indus river networks  review of market and industry data and discussions with indus river networks management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the opportunities in the virtual private networking market and the unique technology architecture of riverworks  substantial gross margins were expected through the forecast period 
our cost of sales was projected to average approximately through fiscal and increase gradually to in fiscal our selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation  were projected to remain constant as a percentage of sales at approximately 
our research and development expenditures were expected to peak in fiscal at of sales and then remain constant at of sales in fiscal and thereafter 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return for companies in between the start up and the early development stages 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of were used for the business enterprise and for the in process research and development 
we believe these rates were appropriate because they were commensurate with the early stage of development for indus river networks  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process research and development  the useful life of the technology  the profitability levels of the technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the forecasts used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions that we believed to be reasonable 
however  at the time these forecasts were made  it was uncertain whether the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  would prove accurate 
our assumptions may have been incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances are likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the projected and actual results from the acquisition date of january  have been materially consistent 
the majority of the projects in process at the time of the acquisition have progressed reasonably consistent with the planned schedule 
research and development expenditures since the acquisition have not differed materially from expectations 
we expect to successfully complete these research and development programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects and these projects may not prove technologically or commercially successful 
such factors as efforts to achieve technical viability  uncertainty regarding standards required for new products  the rapid pace of changing technology inherent in the industries in which the company operates  as well as competitive threats  contribute to the significant risks of completing the development of these technologies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consist principally of planning  designing  and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and operating results and a portion of the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
we believe  as we did at the time of the acquisition  that if we do not successfully complete these outstanding in process research and development efforts  our future operating results would be materially adversely impacted and may never realize the value of these in process research and development programs 
on september   the company acquired network security wizards  inc  a privately held company that develops intrusion detection system technology 
under the terms of the agreement  the company i issued  shares of its common stock to the two stockholders of nsw  ii issued  shares of its common stock to be held in escrow on behalf of the two stockholders of nsw subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of certain events and iii granted  options to purchase the company s common stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of nsw 
the company recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of million 
this acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the cost represents  shares of common stock at per share and  options  valued at approximately million 
the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of million was allocated to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of four years 
the  shares of common stock that are held in escrow were recorded as unearned stock based compensation of million and were not included in the cost of the acquisition 
the stock based compensation will be amortized over a two year period 
the company s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of nsw from the acquisition date 
fiscal divestitures on january   the company and flextronics entered into a definitive agreement for cabletron to divest its manufacturing and repair services operations located in rochester  new hampshire and limerick  ireland to flextronics which closed on february  flextronics acquired the company s manufacturing assets  inventories and manufacturing personnel 
simultaneously with this transaction  the company contracted with flextronics as an oem to produce most of its products 
in anticipation of this divestiture  the company recorded a charge of million related to lowering its carrying value of inventory as cost of goods sold expense and recorded a million charge related to personnel costs as sg a expense 
the company received million for inventory that it sold to flextronics and million for manufacturing related fixed assets  including buildings 
on december   the company sold its flowpoint subsidiary to efficient networks  inc in exchange for million shares of efficient common stock and  shares of efficient preferred stock 
the common stock was subject to various restrictions on resale 
the preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock following the approval of efficient shareholders at a special meeting on april  in connection with the sale of flowpoint  cabletron and efficient entered into an oem agreement under which cabletron will resell the efficient and flowpoint product lines 
fiscal acquisitions yago systems  inc in connection with the acquisition of yago  the company allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the company expensed these costs as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets were determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of yago s next generation switching router family of products and technologies 
at the time of its acquisition  yago was a development stage company that had spent approximately million on research and development focused on the development of advanced gigabit switching technology 
in fact  all of yago s efforts since the company s inception had been directed towards the introduction of an advanced gigabit layer  layer  and layer switching and router product family 
yago had no developed products or technology and had not generated any revenues as of its acquisition date 
at the time  yago was testing the technology related to the msr  its first product to be released  and was developing its msr family of products 
these two primary development efforts were made up of six significant research and development components  which were ongoing at the acquisition date 
these component efforts included continued msr development and testing  research and development of the msr a desktop version of the msr  development of the msr  development of wide area network interfaces for its switching products  routing software research and development  and device management software research and development 
at the time of yago s acquisition  the company believed that the msr product family of switching routers would set a new standard for performance and functionality by delivering wire speed layer  layer and layer functionality 
designed for the enterprise and isp backbone markets  upon completion of their development  the msr products were intended to offer large table capacity  a multi gigabit non blocking backplane  low latency and seamless calling 
yago also intended to develop its msr products to be interoperable with other standard based routers and switches 
as of the acquisition date  management expected the development of the msr product family would be the only mechanism to fuel yago s revenue growth and profitability in the future 
despite the incomplete state of yago s technology  the company felt that the projected size and growth of the market for the msr product  yago s demonstrated promise in the development of the msr product family and the consideration paid by cabletron s competitors to acquire companies comparable to yago all warranted the consideration paid by cabletron for yago 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the proposed technologies met their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
anticipated completion dates for the projects in progress were expected to occur over the two years following the acquisition and the company expected to begin generating the economic benefits from the technologies in the second half of fiscal expenditures to complete the msr technology were expected to total approximately million two years following the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  cabletron anticipated generating significant increases in revenues and undiscounted cash flows from the acquisition of yago  with a projected peak in and then a decline as other new products displaced those used in the original forecast assumptions 
yago  which has been renamed riverstone networks  makes up cabletron s internet infrastructure solutions business for internet service providers and other telecommunications service providers 
cabletron also maintains a significant enterprise market business 
the yago based products began generating significant revenue for the enterprise markets during cabletron s fiscal year ended february  this began with the release of a fully featured msr in july and continued with the release of the mssr product 
cabletron continued to increase sales of products based on the yago in process projects in the enterprise market during the fiscal year ended february  based on additional successful product introductions including the msr  msr and wide area network interfaces 
based on riverstone s markets the company began to experience significant revenue growth from the yago products beginning the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended february  this reflected the growth of the service provider marketplace and acceptance of the underlying yago technology as it pertained to the service provider market 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were projected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were projected to enter the market 
cost of sales was estimated based on yago s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses were projected to remain constant 
research and development expenses were projected to decrease as a percentage of sales as the in process projects were completed 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  discount rates of to were used for the business enterprise and for the in process r d 
the company believes these rates were appropriate because they were commensurate with yago s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at this time 
the projected and actual results to date have been materially consistent 
the majority of the projects in process at the time of the acquisition have been completed reasonably consistently with the planned schedule and the initial products have been brought to market 
the company continued to work toward the completion of some of the projects underway at yago at the time of the acquisition as well as the follow on projects based on the underlying technology associated with the acquired in process projects 
research and development expenditures since the acquisition have not differed materially from expectations 
the risks associated with these continued efforts  including the follow on projects  are still considered significant  and no assurance can be given that the company s upcoming products will meet market expectations 
the company expects to continue its support of these efforts and believes it has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
such factors as efforts to achieve technical viability  uncertainty regarding standards required for new products  the rapid pace of changing technology inherent in the industries in which the company operates  as well as competitive threats contribute to the significant risks of completing the development of these technologies 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consist principally of planning  designing  and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and operating results and a portion of the value of the in process research and development might never be realized 
dslam division of ariel corporation on september   cabletron acquired the assets and liabilities of ariel 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including fees  expenses and other costs related to the acquisition 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of the dslam division of ariel corporation from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of ariel  the company allocated million million  net of tax of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
the valuation of the in process research and development ipr d incorporated the guidance on ipr d valuation methodologies promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec 
these methodologies incorporate the notion that cash flows attributable to development efforts  including the effort to be completed on the development effort underway  and development of future versions of the product that have not yet been undertaken  should be excluded in the valuation of ipr d 
this allocation represents risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete products 
at the date of acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development r d in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the company used independent third party appraisers to assess and allocate values to the in process research and development 
the value assigned to these assets was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established  including development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of ariel s next generation dslam technology 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired ipr d into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development is based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
for purposes of the ipr d valuation  the total revenues attributable to ariel were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  ariel had no existing products and accordingly all revenue growth in the first several years are related to the in process technologies 
for purposes of the ipr d valuation  it was estimated that revenues for the in process projects would peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
cost of sales was estimated based on ariel s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the network equipment arena and ariel s unique technology architecture  substantial gross margins were estimated through the forecast period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was forecasted to decline until and then remain constant at 
sg a expenses including depreciation as a percentage of sales were projected to decline slightly until and then remain constant at 
r d expenditures as a percentage of sales were projected to remain constant at over the projection period 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of percent was determined to be appropriate for the in process r d 
these discount rates were commensurate with ariel s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at the time of acquisition 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined to abandon its efforts regarding dsl related technology 
the company s dsl efforts were largely a result of technology acquired in the acquisitions of ariel and flowpoint 
the company finalized its decision to abandon r d on dsl technology when it sold its flowpoint subsidiary  thus the company expensed the remainding million of the ariel goodwill 
flowpoint corp 
on september   cabletron acquired flowpoint  corp  a privately held manufacturer of digital subscriber line router networking products for million  payable in four installments 
prior to the agreement  cabletron owned of the outstanding shares of flowpoint stock 
the first installment was paid in the form of cash while the remaining installments were paid in the form of cabletron common stock 
during the year ended february   the company issued approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to the installment payments 
in addition  cabletron assumed  options  valued at approximately million 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of the acquisition 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of flowpoint from the acquisition date until december   the date on which the company sold flowpoint to efficient 
in connection with the acquisition of flowpoint  the company recorded special charges of million for in process research and development projects

for purposes of the in process r d valuation  the total revenues attributable to flowpoint were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  flowpoint had a few existing products  which lacked the technological breadth and depth necessary in the evolving networking equipment market 
accordingly  for purposes of the in process r d valuation  it was estimated that significant revenue growth in the first several years would be primarily related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were projected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market

the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of percent was determined to be appropriate for the in process r d 
these discount rates were commensurate with flowpoint s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at the time of the acquisition 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of its year ended february   the company sold its flowpoint division to efficient networks 
consequently  the company expensed the remainder of the goodwill associated with this acquisition which resulted in decreasing the realized gain from the sale of flowpoint 
netvantage  inc on september   cabletron acquired netvantage  inc  a publicly held manufacturer of ethernet workgroup switches 
under the terms of the merger agreement  cabletron issued million shares of cabletron common stock to the shareholders of netvantage in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of stock of netvantage 
cabletron recorded the cost of the acquisition at approximately million  including direct costs of the acquisition 
the cost represents million shares at per share  in addition to direct acquisition costs 
cabletron s consolidated results of operations include the operating results of netvantage  inc from the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of netvantage  the company recorded special charges of million for in process research and development projects

for purposes of the ipr d valuation  the total revenues attributable to netvantage were projected to exceed million within years  assuming the successful completion and market acceptance of the major r d efforts 
as of the valuation date  netvantage had a few existing products  which lacked the technological breadth and depth necessary in the evolving networking equipment market 
accordingly  it was estimated that the significant revenue growth in the first several years would be primarily related to the in process technologies 
the estimated revenues for the in process projects were expected to peak in and then decline as other new products and technologies were expected to enter the market 
to date  actual revenues have been substantially similar to those projected 
cost of sales was estimated based on netvantage s internally generated projections and discussions with management regarding anticipated gross margin improvements 
due to the market opportunities in the network equipment arena and netvantage s unique technology architecture  substantial gross margins were projected through the forecast period 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was forecasted to remain constant at

the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and developmental projects  a discount rate of percent was determined to be appropriate for the in process r d 
these discount rates are commensurate with netvantage s stage of development  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and  the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at the time of the acquisition 
the forecasts used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believed to be reasonable but which  at the time  was inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
at the time such forecasts were made  it was uncertain whether the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability 
the company s assumptions may have been incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances were likely to occur 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from the projected results 
the company began recognizing the economic benefits from the technologies in the fourth quarter of the year ended february  the estimated expenditures to complete these projects were reasonable compared to actual expenditures incurred 
the company ceased further research into these projects during the year ended march  the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of acquisition 
during the last quarter of fiscal year  the company wrote off million of the remaining intangible assets relating to netvantage when it finalized its decision to abandon research and development on netvantage related technology and discontinued sales of netvantage products 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments decreased to  million at march  compared  million at february  the balance at february  included  million  recorded as long term investments  related to the company s investment in efficient stock 
at march   the company s investment in efficient was valued at million 
net cash used by operating activities was million in the year ended march  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended february  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended march  was primarily a result of net changes in inventories  prepaid expenses and accounts payable and other non cash items 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended march  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the year ended february  the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures and the receipt of proceeds on written call options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended march  compared to million in the year ended february  the increase was primarily due to cash received for the issuance of preferred stock  warrants and stock purchase rights 
the company also received proceeds from the issuance of subsidiary shares and exercise of subsidiary stock purchase rights primarily related to the riverstone ipo 
these amounts were partially offset by the company s repurchase of its common stock 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  were million  or days of sales outstanding  at march  compared to million at february   or days sales outstanding 
the increase in days of sales outstanding was a result of the timing of sales and related collections 
worldwide inventories were million at march  or days of inventory  compared to million  or days of inventory  at february  the increase of days in inventory was due to the increase in finished goods inventory purchased to protect against an anticipated shortage of supply components 
during the years ended march   february   and february  capital expenditures totaled million  million and million  respectively  and were principally related to upgrades of computer related equipment and investments in technology to improve productivity 
in the opinion of management  internally generated funds from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will provide adequate funds to support the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
business environment and risk factors the following are cautionary statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company may occasionally make forward looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of the company s future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may be contained in  among other things  sec filings and press releases made by the company and in oral statements made by the officers of the company 
actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
therefore  no assurances can be given that the results in such forward looking statements will be achieved 
important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ from those contained in such forward looking statements include  among others  the factors mentioned below 
in the following factors  references to we  us  our or similar terms refer to the company 
risks related to cabletron the completion of our transformation involves risks 
following shareholder approval at our annual meeting  we contributed a substantial portion of our operating assets and liabilities to four operating subsidiaries  enterasys  riverstone  aprisma and gnts 
in february  we completed an initial public offering of riverstone 
on march   we announced our intention to distribute all of our shares of riverstone to our shareholders in a spin off transaction and to establish aprisma and enterasys as independent public companies 
in addition  we are considering other strategic alternatives with respect to our operating subsidiaries  including the sale of one or more of the operating subsidiaries 
we are not obligated to complete any of these transactions and cannot assure you whether any distribution or other strategic transaction will be approved or implemented 
the distribution of riverstone and the establishment of aprisma and enterasys as independent public companies will depend upon the individual performance of each subsidiary  market conditions and similar considerations 
also  all of these transactions are subject to conditions  including irs rulings and shareholder votes  if deemed necessary or desirable  as well as other regulatory approvals and uncertainties 
any distribution or other strategic transaction will be implemented only if our board of directors continues to believe that it is in the best interests of the subsidiary and our stockholders 
if we fail to satisfy any conditions  if we encounter unfavorable or different financial  industry or economic conditions  or if other unforeseen events intervene  some or all of the currently planned steps could occur on a different timetable or on different terms than we currently anticipate  or might not occur at all 
we believe that the shares of enterasys and riverstone that we own comprise a substantial portion of our value 
following any distribution of these shares  our stock price will likely trade at substantially lower prices  and may remain low unless our stockholders approve and we implement a reverse stock split 
in addition  investors who hold our shares because of our ownership of enterasys  riverstone or both may sell our shares  creating further downward pressure on our stock price 
a portion of our common stock is held by mutual funds obligated to purchase stocks in the standard poor s index 
if we do not remain in this index following the distribution of enterasys or riverstone  these mutual funds will be required to sell our stock 
substantial sales of our common stock following the distribution of enterasys  riverstone or both could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
many of our management personnel are employees of enterasys and will leave cabletron when we distribute shares of enterasys to our shareholders 
enterasys provides many administrative services to us and our other operating subsidiaries under a sub services agreement  which enterasys may terminate upon one full fiscal quarter s notice 
following our distribution of enterasys shares  enterasys may terminate this sub services agreement  and we may be unable to develop sufficient administrative capacity to operate efficiently by the effective date of termination 
we have received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the distribution of riverstone common stock to shareholders of cabletron will qualify as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we may seek a similar ruling  or an opinion of legal counsel  with respect to our intention to establish aprisma and enterasys as independent public companies 
rulings and opinions of this nature are subject to various representations and limitations  and in any event  are not binding upon the internal revenue service or any court 
if a distribution of a subsidiary s shares fails to qualify as a tax free distribution under section of the internal revenue code  we will recognize a taxable gain equal to the difference between the fair market value of the applicable subsidiary on the date of the distribution and our adjusted tax basis in the applicable subsidiary s common stock on the date of the distribution 
in addition  each of our stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable corporate distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the applicable subsidiary s common stock received by the stockholder on the date of distribution 
any taxable gain recognized by us or our stockholders as a result of a distribution which failed to qualify as a tax free distribution under section is likely to be substantial 
limitations under section of the internal revenue code may restrict our ability to use our capital stock following any distribution of a subsidiary 
these limitations will generally prevent us from issuing capital stock to the extent that the issuance is part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes one or more of the distributions  and pursuant to which one or more persons acquire shares of our capital stock that represents or more of the voting power or or more of the value of our capital stock 
these limitations may restrict our ability to undertake transactions involving the issuance of our capital stock that we believe would be beneficial 
we have a history of operating losses in recent years and may not operate profitably in the future 
we have experienced operating losses in recent years and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
for the fiscal years ended february   february  and march   we incurred operating losses of million  million and million respectively 
we will need to generate higher revenues and lower our expenses to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues or reduce expenses to achieve profitability  and if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability over subsequent periods 
if the current global economic slow down were to continue or the united states were to enter a recession  our ability to increase revenues may be seriously adversely affected 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors related to our industry  the markets for our products and how we manage our business 
we have little or no control over many of these factors and any of these factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
in addition to the other risks that we discuss in this section  the following may adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
fluctuations in the demand for our products and services  
the timing and size of sales of our products or the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders  
the timing of product introductions and product acceptance by customers  
the timing and level of non cash stock based compensation charges  
increases in the prices or decreases in the availability of the components we purchase  
product returns from our distribution partners in excess of reserves  
our ability to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products  
the timing and level of research and development and prototype expenses  
the mix of products and services sold  and 
changes in the distribution channels through which we sell our products 
we plan to continue to increase our operating expenses to fund greater levels of research and development  broaden our customer support capabilities and develop new distribution channels 
we also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as our operating subsidiaries address the increased reporting and other administrative demands that will result from being a publicly traded company 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated organizational growth and revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
as a result  if revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations for any of the reasons set forth above  or for any other reason  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
this revenue shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter  which could result in significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
historically we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of a quarter  with revenues frequently concentrated in the last two weeks of the quarter 
most distribution partners and customers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a quarter  in part because they believe they are able to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
because we rely on the generation of a large portion of revenues at the end of the quarter  traditionally we have not been able  and in the future do not expect to be able  to predict our financial results for any quarter until very late in the quarter 
due to this end of period buying pattern  we may not achieve our financial forecasts  either because expected sales do not occur in the anticipated quarter or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us than anticipated 
due to the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
you should not rely on our results or growth for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock may fall 
risks related to our industry there is intense competition in the market for network communications equipment  which could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the network infrastructure equipment market is dominated by cisco systems  which currently has substantially greater market share than any other participant in that market  including us 
in addition  this market is intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
our other principal competitors include alcatel  avaya  formerly part of lucent  extreme networks  foundry networks  hewlett packard  nortel networks  marconi  and com 
we also experience competition from a number of other smaller public and private companies 
we may experience reluctance by our prospective customers to replace or expand their current infrastructure solutions  which may be supplied by one or more of these competitors  with our products 
there has also been a trend toward consolidation in our industry for several years  and we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market share positions 
we believe that consolidation among our competitors and potential competitors could result in stronger competitors with expanded product offerings and a greater ability to accelerate their development of new technologies 
some of our competitors  particularly cisco  have significantly more established customer support and professional services organizations and substantially greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial and other resources than we do 
many of our competitors also have more customers  greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop  enhance and expand their product offerings more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  pursue acquisitions and other opportunities more readily and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter our market  thereby further intensifying competition 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share  which would materially harm our ability to increase revenues and profitability 
we and our competitors have pursued and continue to pursue a strategy of acquiring network communications companies that have developed advanced networking technologies 
the acquisition of these companies allows us and our competitors to offer new products without the lengthy time delays associated with internal product development 
we compete with our competitors to acquire companies of this nature 
as a result  in addition to other factors  the prices paid to acquire companies of this nature is often very high  when compared to the assets and sales of these companies 
the greater resources of our competitors may enable them to compete more effectively for the acquisition of companies of this nature and may cause us to pay higher prices for the companies we do acquire 
in addition  we and our competitors invest in early stage network communications companies to secure access to advanced technology under development by these companies and to improve our chances of acquiring these companies in the future 
if we are unable to successfully invest in companies with promising network communications technology  we may be unable to gain access to their technology and may have more difficulty acquiring these companies in the future 
if we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological changes  our products could become obsolete and we may be unable to attract new customers or retain our existing customers 
the market for network communications equipment is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete 
accordingly  we may be required to make significant and ongoing investments in future periods in order to remain competitive 
the development of new products or technologies is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may be unable to respond quickly or cost effectively to these developments or to obtain the necessary funds to develop or acquire new technologies or products needed to compete 
if we do not anticipate and meet evolving customer requirements  we will not retain our current customers or attract new customers 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop and manage customer relationships to introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our current and prospective customers may require product features and capabilities that our products do not have 
we must effectively and timely anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products that meet those demands 
our failure to develop products that satisfy evolving customer requirements would seriously harm our ability to achieve or sustain market acceptance for our products and prevent us from recovering our investment in developing products 
we have responded in the past  and expect to respond in the future  to customer requirements by occasionally licensing products from others 
if we are unable to license these products  or to license them on favorable terms  we may be unable to provide our customers with the products and services they demand 
in addition  we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
material delays in introducing new products may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors  which could seriously harm our business 
we may expend significant resources on educating potential customers about our products without achieving actual sales 
the purchase of our products often represents a significant capital investment by our customers related to their network infrastructure and typically involves significant internal procedures involving the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
we often must provide a significant level of education to our customers on the benefits of our products and services 
this frequently results in a lengthy sales process  and purchases of our products are subject to a number of significant risks  including customer budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews 
during this time we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
if we fail to recognize revenue from a particular customer after making such a substantial investment  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
we may be unable to expand our indirect distribution channels  which may hinder our ability to increase our revenues 
our sales and distribution strategy relies heavily on our indirect sales efforts  including value added resellers  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
we believe that our future success will also depend on our ability to maintain and expand existing relationships  as well as establish successful new relationships  with a variety of systems integrators 
we have entered into agreements with only a small number of large systems integrators to date 
we also intend to increase our reliance on our value added resellers  which requires that we add more sales personnel to monitor this distribution channel 
our value added resellers and systems integrators are not  and will not be  prohibited from selling products and services that compete with ours 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our existing agreements or reach new agreements with additional systems integrators or other distribution partners on a timely basis or at all  or that our systems integrators and distribution partners will devote adequate resources to selling our products and services 
if we are unable to expand our indirect sales operations  we may be unable to increase market awareness or sales of our products and services  which may prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues 
we work with other companies to develop products in our primary market or in complementary markets  which increases our reliance on others for generating revenues and may lead to disputes about ownership of intellectual property 
we intend to establish strategic partnerships with industry leading organizations in complementary markets to incorporate our networking technology into products or solutions sold by these organizations 
we have not yet entered into any agreements of this type and may be unable to do so in the future on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are able to enter into these agreements  we will likely be unable to control the amount and timing of resources our partners devote to developing products that incorporate our technology and the efforts they devote toward selling these products 
if we are unable to enter into these agreements on favorable terms  or if these partners do not devote sufficient resources to developing and selling the products that incorporate our technology  our revenue growth will be lower than expected 
although we intend to retain all rights to our technology in these arrangements  we may be unable to negotiate the retention of these rights 
furthermore  disputes may arise over the ownership of technology developed as a result of these partnerships 
these and other potential disagreements between us and these partners could lead to delays in the research  development or sale of products we are developing with them or more serious disputes  which may be costly to resolve 
disputes with partners who also serve as indirect distribution channels for our products could reduce our revenues from sales of our products in our traditional market  as well as in these complementary markets 
we use several key components for our products that are purchased from single or limited sources and we could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs 
we currently work with third parties to manufacture our key proprietary application specific integrated circuits  which are custom designed circuits built to perform a specific function more rapidly than a general purpose microprocessor 
these proprietary circuits are very complex and these third parties are our sole source suppliers for the specific types of application specific integrated circuits that they supply to us 
we also have limited sources for the semiconductor chip that we use in our wireless roam about solution 
we do not carry significant inventories of these components and we do not have a long term fixed price or minimum volume agreement with these suppliers 
if we encounter future problems with these vendors  we likely would not be able to develop an alternate source in a timely manner 
there are also several key components used in the manufacture of our products that are purchased from single or limited sources  and we are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
our contract manufacturers may experience shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components in the future 
if we are unable to purchase our critical components  particularly our application specific integrated circuits  at such times and in such volumes as our business requires  we will not be able to deliver our products and services to our customers in accordance with their schedule requirements 
in addition  any delay in obtaining key components for new products under development could cause a significant delay in the initial launch of these products 
any delay in the launch of new products could harm our reputation and operating results 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain these critical components in sufficient volume and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we have little control over their cost 
accordingly  the lack of alternative sources for these components may force us to pay higher prices for them 
if we are unable to obtain these components from our current suppliers or others at economical prices  our margins could be adversely impacted unless we raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner 
existing competitive conditions may not permit us to do so  in which case we may suffer increased losses or reduced profits 
we depend on a single contract manufacturer for providing substantially all of our manufacturing requirements  and a failure by this contract manufacturer would impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
we do not have internal manufacturing capabilities 
we outsource substantially all of our manufacturing to one company  flextronics international  ltd  which procures material on our behalf and provides comprehensive manufacturing services  including assembly  test  control and shipment to our customers 
if we experience increased demand for our products  we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity with flextronics or add additional contract manufacturers 
flextronics also builds products for other companies  and we cannot be certain that they will always have sufficient quantities of inventory and capacity available to fill orders placed by our customers or that they will allocate their internal resources to fill these orders on a timely basis 
further  qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming 
the loss of our existing contract manufacturer or our failure to timely qualify a new contract manufacturer to meet anticipated demand increases could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our product 
in this event  we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships 
if we fail to accurately predict our manufacturing requirements  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays 
we use a forward looking forecast of anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
if we overestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturer may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our requirements  our contract manufacturer may have an inadequate inventory  which could result in delays in delivery to our customers and recognition of revenue 
in addition  the lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
for example  some of our application specific integrated circuits have a lead time of up to eight months 
our customers and business partners may not recognize our new brands  which could adversely affect our sales and marketing efforts and cause our revenue to decline 
before the transformation of our business  we sold our products and services under the cabletron name 
we now sell our products and services under the names of our operating subsidiaries and are changing the trademarks and trade names under which we conduct our business to these names 
we are also changing the names of some of our products 
we believe that the sale of our products and services has significantly benefited from the use of the cabletron brand name 
because we have previously marketed our products under the cabletron name  our existing customers and business partners and investors generally may not recognize our new brands or the names of our products 
we plan to incur significant sales and marketing expense to build new strong brand identities 
the expenses we incur toward building our brands  however  will not result in immediate returns and it may be a long time before our customers and business partners recognize and make positive connections with our new brands 
if we fail to promote our new brands and new product names successfully in local and international markets  our business may suffer 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property may hinder our ability to compete 
we regard our products and technology as proprietary 
we attempt to protect them through a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  contractual restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary rights 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products or technology without authorization  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  or to develop similar technology independently 
we have in the past and may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
we may be subject to claims that our intellectual property infringes upon the proprietary rights of others  and a successful claim could harm our ability to sell and develop our products 
we license technology from third parties and are continuing to develop and acquire additional intellectual property 
although we have not been involved in any material litigation relating to our intellectual property  we expect that participants in our markets will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
third parties may try to claim our products infringe upon their intellectual property  in which case we would be forced to defend ourselves or our customers  manufacturers and suppliers against those claims 
any claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  in which case we would have to cease selling  incorporating or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property and expend substantial amounts of resources to redesign our products 
if we are forced to enter into unacceptable royalty or licensing agreements or to redesign our products  our business and prospects could suffer 
our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations 
our sales outside of the united states accounted for in the fiscal year ended march   in the fiscal year ended february  and of our revenues in the fiscal year ended february  one of our principal growth strategies is to expand our presence in international markets both through increased international sales and strategic relationships 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in future periods 
we often experience increased costs in international markets  which reduces our margins and profitability 
our international presence subjects us to international risks  including 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations  
political and economic instability  
delays in meeting customer commitments associated with managing an international distribution system  
increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices in many international markets  
managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  
increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  
natural disasters  political uncertainties and changing regulatory environments in foreign countries  and 
difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries 
the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
as a result  increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could result in a reduction in sales and profitability 
to the extent our prices or expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
our products are very complex and undetected defects may increase our costs and harm our reputation with our customers 
our networking products are extremely complex and must operate successfully with equally complex products of other vendors 
our products may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as new upgrades are released 
these errors may relate to the product itself or to its interoperability with other products in the network 
the pressures we face to be the first to market new products increases the possibility that we will offer products in which we or our customers later discover errors 
we have experienced new product and product upgrade errors in the past and expect similar problems in the future 
these problems could result in our incurring significant warranty and repair costs and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts 
if we are unable to fix these problems in a timely manner  we would likely experience loss of or delay in revenues and significant damage to our reputation and business prospects 
we have made and expect to make future acquisitions which involve numerous risks 
we have supplemented and expect to supplement further our internal growth by acquiring complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we recently acquired indus river networks  inc and network security wizards  inc 
as part of our strategy to increase our presence in the market for virtual private networks and for network security 
in the future  we may be unable to identify and acquire suitable candidates on reasonable terms  if at all 
we compete for acquisition candidates with other companies that have substantially greater financial  management and other resources than we do 
acquisitions often involve significant transaction costs  and there may be substantial costs incurred in connection with potential acquisitions that are not successfully completed 
if we do complete an acquisition  integrating newly acquired organizations and products and services is likely to be expensive  time consuming and a strain on our managerial resources 
these acquisitions  particularly multiple acquisitions over a short period of time  involve a number of risks that may result in our failure to achieve the desired benefits of the transaction 
these risks include  among others  the following 
difficulties in assimilating the operations of the acquired businesses  
potential disruption of our existing operations  
an inability to integrate  train and retain key personnel  
diversion of management attention and employees from day to day operations  
an inability to incorporate  develop or market acquired technologies or products  
unexpected liabilities of the acquired business without sufficient indemnification  
operating inefficiencies associated with managing companies in different locations  and 
impairment of relationships with employees  customers  suppliers and strategic partners 
these acquisitions also may not generate sufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition in the short term or at all 
we may finance acquisitions by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
we may also use cash or incur debt to pay for these acquisitions 
in addition  we may be required to expend substantial funds to develop acquired technologies to amortize significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with future acquisitions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  from time to time  we have made  and expect to make in the future  acquisitions that resulted in in process research and development expenses being charged in a particular quarter  which could adversely affect our operating results for that quarter 
our ability to develop  market and support products depends upon retaining and attracting highly qualified individuals in our industry 
our future success depends to a significant extent on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  assimilate and retain large numbers of highly qualified engineering  sales  marketing  managerial and support personnel 
the demand for qualified personnel is high and competition for their services is intense 
the competition for qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense in the new england area  where our principal operations are located 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could delay the development and introduction of our products  negatively impact our ability to sell them  and increase our costs of doing business 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease over time  which may reduce our revenue and gross margins 
our industry has experienced erosion of average selling prices in recent years 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to increased sales discounts and new product or technology introductions by us or our competitors 
our prices will also likely be affected adversely by downturns in regional or industry economies  such as the recent down turn in the united states economy 
we also expect our gross margins may be affected adversely by increases in material or labor costs and an increasing reliance on third party distribution channels 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient cost reductions and increases in sales volumes  any decline in average selling prices will reduce our revenues and gross margins 
if our products do not comply with complex governmental regulations and evolving industry standards  our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability 
the market for network communications equipment is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
to be competitive  we must continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have had to delay the introduction of new products to comply with third party standards testing 
we may be unable to address compatibility and interoperability issues that arise from technological changes and evolving industry standards 
we also may devote significant resources developing products designed to meet standards that are not widely adopted 
in the united states  our products must comply with various governmental regulations and industry regulations and standards  including those defined by the federal communications commission  underwriters laboratories and networking equipment building standards 
internationally  our products are required to comply with standards or obtain certifications established by telecommunications authorities in various countries and with recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards  fail to anticipate correctly which standards will be widely adopted or fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we will be unable to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenues or achieving profitability 
the united states government requires that network equipment providers satisfy certain performance requirements before they are permitted to sell to the government 
we have not yet satisfied these requirements  although at least one of our competitors has satisfied the requirements 
other governments or industries may establish similar performance requirements or tests that we may be unable to satisfy 
if we are unable to satisfy the performance or other requirements of the united states government or other industries that establish them  our revenue growth may be lower than expected 
because cisco maintains a leadership position in selling network communications equipment products  they may have the ability to establish de facto standards within the industry 
any actions by cisco or any other industry leaders that diminish compliance by our products with industry or de facto standards  or the ability of our products to interoperate with other networking products  would be damaging to our reputation and our ability to generate revenue 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the aicpa accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  modification of software revenue recognition which requires recognition of revenue using specific methods and amends sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop and amends certain paragraphs of sop the company adopted sop for its year ended february  the adoption of sop did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the year ended february  in june  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which requires companies to record derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal  which did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the company holds minority equity investments in various public and private companies 
the publicly traded equities are subject to market volatility  are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
many of the private investments are early stage companies which are highly illiquid and inherently risky  thus the company could lose its entire investment 
at march   the company held approximately million shares of common stock of efficient networks  which it received as consideration for the sale of its flowpoint subsidiary on december  as of march   the company determined that in accordance with sfas  the efficient shares had experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
the company recognized a reduction in value of the efficient investment of million based on the expected realizable value of per share  which represents the siemens tender offer price 
there was an associated reduction in the deferred gain of million  which resulted in pre tax net other expense of million 
the company also recorded other than temporary declines on five other publicly traded equity securities which resulted in pre tax net other expense of approximately million 
on march   the company liquidated its holdings of efficient common stock in a tender offer by siemens ag siemens 
the company s financial statements as of march  valued the company s interest in efficient at approximately the same price as the tender offer 
at march   the company s fair value holdings of efficient stock totaled million and represented of total assets 
interest rate sensitivity 
the company maintains an investment portfolio consisting partly of debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities 
the securities that the company classifies as held to maturity are recorded on the balance sheet at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities are not material 
the securities that the company classifies as available for sale are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax as a component of stockholders equity 
a hypothetical or basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million or million decrease  respectively approximately percent or percent  respectively in the fair market value of the securities 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the company  as a result of its global operating and financial activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in order to minimize the potential adverse impact  the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the currency risk inherent in global operations 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments 
gains and losses on the contracts are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities 
at march   the company had purchased forwards with a notional value of approximately million and options with a notional value of approximately million 
a hypothetical percent appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar from march  market rates would not result in a material decrease in fair market value  earnings or cash flows 
also  any gains or losses on the contracts are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions and consequently a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
