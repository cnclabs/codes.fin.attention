these increases were partially offset by a decrease  on a percent of revenue basis  in salaries  wages and employee benefits

the increase in other expenses  as a percentage of revenue  resulted primarily from higher recruiting and training costs brought about by a higher driver turnover rate and increased competition for drivers 
the percentage decrease  relative to salaries  wages and employee benefits expense for compared to was due to the reduction in management and executive incentives for  which are based on the profitability of the company  the effects of fuel surcharges and the elimination of a substantial portion of drivers incentives earned during the fourth quarter of which resulted from a change in the drivers pay package  except for drivers in the company s dedicated services division  that eliminated incentive pay and overall  increased mileage based pay by

although the company competes primarily on the basis of its service provided to its customers rather than rates charged  rate discounting continues to be a factor in obtaining and retaining business 
the number of firms competing in the truckload segment of the industry has increased dramatically since the deregulation of the industry in also  a depressed economy tends to increase the competitive pressure placed on rate and service from alternative modes of transportation such as less than truckload and railroads 
the company s management believes that the truckload segment of the market has reached a certain level of maturity as the market exists currently and that the company s further growth in the truckload segment of the industry is likely to be attained by increasing its market share rather than through an increase in the overall size of the market 
the company experienced higher driver turnover and a reduction in equipment utilization as well as increased insurance costs in the first three quarter of because of large number of students and inexperienced drivers hired during this period 
in order to combat this trend  the company issued a driver pay increase on october  with this pay increase  the company eliminated incentive pay from its pay package except for drivers in its dedicated services division 
this pay increase was implemented in order to dramatically improve driver recruiting efforts by attracting more experienced drivers than in the past and improve driver retention by offering a more competitive pay package than most other companies in the truckload segment of the industry 
this pay raise will increase driver wages by approximately of revenue annually 
management has set goals for recruiting  retention  driver and equipment utilization and claims cost to be achieved in order to recover this additional wage cost 
more experienced drivers will also help the company provide superior customer service

seasonality in the trucking industry generally  revenues decrease as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses increase  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs 
future revenues could be impacted if customers reduce shipments due to temporary plant closings  which historically have occurred during july and december 
fuel availability and cost the motor carrier industry is dependent upon the availability of diesel fuel  and fuel shortages or increases in fuel taxes or fuel costs have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect the profitability of usa truck 
fuel prices have fluctuated widely and fuel taxes have generally increased in recent years 
the company has not experienced difficulty in maintaining necessary fuel supplies  and in the past the company generally has been able to recover most of the increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes from customers through increased freight rates 
diesel prices increased during and there can be no assurance when diesel prices will decrease to price levels experienced in recent periods 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover any future increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes through increased rates
