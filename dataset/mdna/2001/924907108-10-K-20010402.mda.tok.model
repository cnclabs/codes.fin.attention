item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background we are a provider of telecommunications software and middleware in the form of products and services for network management applications and telecommunications devices 
we develop  market  and support vertically integrated  object oriented software solutions for the management of public telecommunications networks 
our solutions cover the telecommunications management network tmn market and the emerging common object request broker architecture corba telecommunications market 
our tmn products are based upon the international telecommunications union s tmn standard and support network operation and management over diverse transmission media and protocols 
we believe that we offer the only commercially available  fully interoperable suite of products and tools that span the network element  element management  network management and service management layers of the tmn model 
our corba software products e orb are designed to enable operations support systems oss and network infrastructure to integrate in ways which will accelerate network and service deployment and provide for the transition from tmn managed networks to corba solutions 
our corba software also provides command and control software infrastructure for telecommunications hardware and systems 
the vertel mediation framework mediation framework software product is used to simplify and accelerate the integration of network infrastructure with telecom oss infrastructure 
we offer embedded software for network equipment and software solutions to allow telecommunications service providers to integrate proprietary  simple network management protocol snmp  tmn  and corba based network management systems with standards based solutions 
in addition  we offer object oriented software platforms that facilitate the rapid development of network and service management applications and features such as fault detection and automatic response  remote improvement of network configuration  automation of accounting and billing functions and optimization of network traffic and security 
in september  we announced plans to offer a new set of services based on our mediation framework 
these web based hosted services  known as webresolve  are designed to automate service assurance functions for telecommunications providers 
costs of approximately  relating to the introduction of webresolve are included in the financial statements 
however  we do not expect any material revenues from webresolve until the second half of we also provide professional services  such as turnkey management solutions  in addition to product integration and product application services 
our professional services include system analysis and design  source code portation and interface  custom application development  conformance and certification testing and technical support services 
we sell products and services primarily through a direct sales force in the united states and abroad and  in certain territories  through third party agents 
our customers include telecommunications service providers and their customers  network equipment manufacturers  independent software developers and software platform vendors 
we derive revenue primarily from software license fees  royalties and services  including professional services  technical support and maintenance 
software license fees consist primarily of licenses of our software products 
we recognize software license revenue based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 as amended 
our software license agreements generally do not provide for a right of return 
we maintain reserves for returns and potential credit losses  neither of which has had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition through december  pursuant to our license agreements  licensees may distribute binary or embedded versions of our software in our licensees products 
royalties or runtime revenues become due upon shipment of products containing the binary or embedded code 
generally  software license royalty revenue is recognized upon notification by our licensee that products incorporating our software have been shipped by our licensee or  for customers for which we have sufficient historical information  upon estimated amounts which we expect the customer to report 
because of the development times required for licensees to design and ship products containing binary or embedded software  we generally do not receive royalties from shipments of such products for at least three quarters from the date we initially ship source code 
we separately offer professional services  including system design and engineering  custom application development  source code portation  conformance testing and certification and application development 
many of our customers contract for professional services 
these services are typically based on a detailed statement of work 
professional services revenue varies according to the size  timing and complexity of the project and is typically billed based on satisfaction of certain milestones or on a per day fee 
revenue from professional services is recognized using the percentage of completion method  or on a time and materials basis 
in certain cases  customers reimburse us for non recurring engineering efforts 
such reimbursements are recognized as revenue and associated costs are reflected as cost of revenues 
our technical support services consist of product support and maintenance  training and on site consulting 
product support and maintenance fees have constituted the majority of technical support and service revenue 
product support and maintenance fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months 
other revenue from training and on site consulting is recognized as performed 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of operations as a percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative general and administrative non employee stock compensation goodwill amortization restructuring expense total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations overview fiscal was a transition year for vertel 
we experienced declining revenues from our traditional tmn based products that had generated most of our revenues in the past 
the tmn standard is being superseded by new technology far more quickly than we had anticipated 
also  our international sales continued to face the challenge of a strong dollar  making our products more expensive for our asian and european markets which in part contributed to lower sales in those markets 
at the same time  however  we moved forward aggressively with a new generation of products that have met with good market acceptance 
our e orb and mediation framework software products have been licensed by alcatel  lucent  motorola  nokia and the us department of defense  among others 
our professional services unit psu revenues increased over the prior year in total  but were lower in the second half of the year reflecting the overall downturn in spending within the telecommunications industry 
late in the year we announced webresolve  which has received positive feedback and may find a larger potential market than we first predicted 
we had expected that our older tmn based technologies would generate sufficient revenue in to allow us time to begin to benefit from anticipated future revenue streams from our new technologies 
however  most of our customers are still in the development stage with new products utilizing e orb 
we anticipate increased revenue from e orb and our mediation framework from royalties as customers actually deploy products that include our software 
therefore  revenues from our new products in were not sufficient to make up for steeper revenue declines in our older tmn based products than we had anticipated 
it also remains difficult to predict the timing of such revenues because we do not yet have a representative sample of customers who have completed the sales and development cycle and have moved on to the deployment phase 
notwithstanding revenue declines  benefits from our cost cutting program implemented in october helped us to reduce our operating loss by compared to our outlook for is optimistic 
we believe demand for our new products will increase 
our products facilitate communication between telecommunications network software and wireless handheld products and network based servers  and make connections between otherwise incompatible telecom software and support software for billing and customer service possible 
our new webresolve speeds the process of identifying performance failures in services provided by traditional telecommunication and emerging service providers such as internet service providers  so that problems can be corrected promptly 
we believe the market for these products is good and that we have reorganized the way we develop and market these products so that we can serve this market in an increasingly cost effective way 
we recognize that we must constantly update our products and continue to keep a tight control on costs 
net revenues 
net revenues declined in to  from  in  with lower revenues in both the license and service and other segments 
the decline followed a increase in net revenues in compared to net revenues of  in license revenue declined in as well as  but was offset in by higher revenues from professional service contracts and maintenance 
sales to customers outside the united states comprised approximately  and respectively of net revenues in  and we have historically reported a high percentage of sales to such customers and expect international sales to continue to be significant to our business 
international sales in were hurt by the continued strong dollar against asian and european currencies  which reduced our sales abroad 
if the dollar strengthens significantly  we may not be able to remain competitive in asian and or european markets 
in addition  even if currency conditions are favorable  our sales cycle is usually lengthy and results in quarterly fluctuations between geographic markets 
finally  any political or economic turmoil in our major asian markets china  japan and korea could impact future sales in the affected area 
license 
license revenues consist primarily of license fees and royalties derived from software products  including tmn based products and new offerings such as e orb and mediation framework 
historically license revenues have accounted for a substantial portion of total revenue 
in  license revenues declined to  from  in  accelerating a decline from  in the decline in was due primarily to lower tmn product revenues due to technological changes in the telecommunications industry and to lower revenues from legacy corba products as we concentrated our development and sales efforts on the higher performance e orb product line 
while we expect to continue to sell tmn based software  particularly in asia and the pacific rim  we expect that these products will be phased out over time as new technology such as e orb and mediation framework takes its place 
license revenues from new products helped to mitigate the decline in license revenues 
the decrease in license revenues in was due primarily to an unusual comparison with a stronger performance in  when we recognized significant licensing fees from a semi exclusive licensing contract for our aeronautical telecommunications network atn router  from licensing revenues in connection with our sale of our cdpd and pact technologies  revenues from our atn and cdpd product lines in the first half of the year prior to their sale  and a one time fee for a license to a related party 
the decline in was partially offset by expersoft licensing revenues recognized in service and other 
service and other revenues consist primarily of professional services  maintenance  technical support  non recurring engineering projects  training and other revenues 
revenues for this segment declined in to  from  in the decline resulted from lower software maintenance revenues  primarily due to non renewal of maintenance contracts on older or discontinued products and lower non recurring engineering services revenues 
the decline was partially offset by higher professional service revenues  resulting primarily from higher utilization of professional service personnel 
service and other revenues increased in from  as a result of higher professional service revenues  and higher maintenance revenues  arising primarily from the acquisition of expersoft 
the increase was partially offset by lower non recurring engineering services revenues 
our professional services revenues are dependent on a limited number of consulting contracts from both new and existing customers 
during the second half of  we experienced a decrease in professional services revenues due to the slowdown in spending within the telecommunications sector 
any continued economic slowdown may lead to deferrals or elimination of such contracts which would adversely impact our personnel utilization and operating results 
additionally  during  we made significant investments in launching webresolve which is designed to automate service assurance functions for telecommunications providers 
a continued economic slowdown may result in a delay or elimination of contracting with new customers which would adversely impact future operating results 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of royalty fees paid for third party software incorporated in our products  the cost of reproduction of our software and user documentation  and delivery of software 
cost of license revenues decreased in to  or of license revenue 
the improvement was primarily the result of the comparison to unusually high cost of license revenues in  resulting from two non recurring items 
in  we made a one time payment of  required under a third party license agreement related to our trader service corba product and recorded costs of an expersoft license transaction valued at  of which  in costs and estimated earnings had accrued to expersoft prior to its acquisition by vertel 
the cost of license revenues of  increased  or  from  in we anticipate that changes in pricing structures and distribution strategies may occur and that license revenue margins can be expected to continue to fluctuate and could decline in future years 
cost of revenues service 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of costs associated with performing professional consulting services  software maintenance and customer technical support such as telephone support  training services and non recurring engineering services 
in these costs included approximately  related to the introduction of webresolve 
cost of service revenues was   and  for  and  respectively  representing  and of service revenues respectively 
the higher percentage of cost of service revenues in compared to primarily resulted from expenses relating to the introduction of webresolve 
the decrease in percentage of cost of service revenues in from was due to the increase in professional service revenue  improved operational efficiencies in our professional services unit and improved maintenance margins due to the addition of expersoft s maintenance customers 
we expect to hire additional consulting personnel in in anticipation of additional consulting service contracts and to staff webresolve 
to the extent that new consulting service contracts do not materialize or webresolve does not generate anticipated revenue  our future profit margins from services would be adversely impacted 
research and development 
the major components of r d expenses are engineering salaries  employee benefits and associated overhead  fees to outside contractors  cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment  which consists primarily of computer and test equipment 
in some cases  r d costs for non recurring engineering projects are reimbursed by customers 
we have historically invested heavily in research and development 
however  total r d expenses declined in to  from  in and also decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the decline was primarily the result of a restructuring plan announced in october  which reduced our overall workforce by  of which the tmn product development staff in the united states accounted for approximately half of the total workforce reduction 
we moved the remaining tmn product development function to our poland operations where costs are lower 
payroll  consulting  recruiting and related costs therefore were reduced 
the percentage decline from was also a result of the comparison to  in which we had higher costs from a non recurring expense for development software  the expense of expersoft s product development organization  as well as a lower charge back to cost of revenues for non recurring engineering services 
our r d expenses in of  represented of revenue  a slight increase from in  when r d expenses were we expect to continue to make investments at approximately the current level in the development of new products and feature enhancements to existing product lines but changes in net revenues of future quarters could influence expenditures in future periods 
since the restructuring  our r d expenditures are concentrated in the areas of corba product development primarily e orb product and related application services and our mediation framework which is designed for the integration of telecom operation support systems and the underlying network equipment management systems 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and associated costs related to selling and marketing  including trade shows and other promotional costs 
we believe that substantial sales and marketing expenditures are essential to developing opportunities for revenue growth and sustaining our competitive position 
however  sales and marketing expenses were reduced in to  from  in  primarily as a result of our personnel reduction in late and consequent reductions in associated payroll  commissions  recruiting  relocation and travel costs 
we maintained our spending on trade shows and incurred marketing costs related to the introduction of webresolve  both of which partially offset the reductions 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased in to from in sales and marketing expenses in had increased from  in  when they comprised of revenues 
the increase in was due primarily to increased personnel and associated payroll  commission  recruiting  relocation and travel costs  as well as higher consulting  trade show  public relations  advertising expenses  and the addition of expenses of expersoft s sales and marketing organization 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel as well as professional fees and investor relations costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in primarily due to lower payroll and facility costs 
the decline was partially offset by increased investor relations  costs primarily due to a larger number of shareholders in general and administrative expenses increased in from  in  primarily due to the addition of expersoft s general and administrative organization  and increased professional and consulting fees 
these increases were partially offset by lower recruiting fees 
general and administrative non employee stock compensation 
non employee stock compensation resulted in  in expenses in  an increase of from  in the charges reflect the value of stock options held by non employee directors which became fully vested during the year  while the charge in was a non recurring charge related to the value of stock options granted to three former officers in january there were no such charges in goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization for was  compared to  in and zero in goodwill resulted from the purchase of expersoft in march of and is being amortized over five years at approximately  per quarter 
restructuring expense 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan designed to reduce operating costs 
we reduced our overall workforce at that time by approximately 
the estimated costs of restructuring recorded in the financial statements for the year ended december  were  and included costs of employee severance pay and the costs of vacating a portion of a facility 
of these costs   was paid in and  was paid in at december   facility reserves totaled  additionally  during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a benefit of  on the reversal of restructuring reserves originally recorded in and  resulting in a net restructuring expense recorded for fiscal of  there was no restructuring benefit or expense recorded in operating loss 
we incurred losses from operations of  in and  in the decrease in loss from operations in was due to lower operating expenses  although this improvement was partially offset by lower revenues and the resulting lower gross profit 
the increased loss from operations in as compared to the operating loss of  in was due to a combination of lower margins and higher operating expenses 
other income  net 
in  other income net increased to  compared to  in and  in other income  net in consisted primarily of a non recurring gain on the sale of our remaining equity interest in systems wizards  interest income  net sub lease income  and a gain on the early termination of a capital lease 
other income  net in consisted primarily of interest income 
other income  net in consisted primarily of the gain on sale  in december of our holdings of series b and series c preferred stock in sonoma systems a former subsidiary  the non recurring gain on the sale of our cdpd and pact technologies  a non recurring gain of approximately  to reflect curtailment of a non us pension plan that previously covered our irish employees  a non recurring gain on the sale of a certain software library and the assignment of certain assets and liabilities of our atn operations  and interest income provision for income taxes 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  consisting primarily of non us taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  in due to the expiration of certain tax contingencies 
in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of  on pre tax income from operations of  no income tax benefit was recognized on pre tax losses from operations of  and  in and  respectively 
our tax provision was positively impacted by the utilization of approximately  of net operating losses carried forward from prior years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted rates 
a valuation allowance equal to the total amount of our net deferred tax assets of  at december  has been established 
the net deferred tax assets might be realized to the extent that we operate profitably in the future during the respective carryforward periods 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used by operating activities during was  compared to  used by operating activities in and  generated from operating activities during the negative cash flow from operations in was comprised primarily of a loss from continuing operations  cash payments for restructuring expenses  decreases in deferred revenue  and accrued wages and related liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  and non cash depreciation and amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
the negative cash flow from operations in was comprised primarily of a loss from continuing operations  and increases in accounts receivable  and deferred revenue 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization  and non cash stock based compensation 
the cash generated from operating activities in was primarily the result of the proceeds from the sale of our cdpd and pact technologies  non cash depreciation and amortization  a decrease in accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses and other current assets  and an increase in accrued taxes 
these amounts were partially offset by payments in of restructuring expenses that were accrued in 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in  net cash used for investing activities was  for and net cash provided by investing activities was  in the net cash provided by investing activities in resulted from net sales of short term investments  and proceeds from the sale of equity securities  which was offset by purchases of property and equipment 
the net cash used for investing activities in was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments  purchases of property and equipment  and cash paid for the acquisition of expersoft  net of cash acquired  partially offset by a decrease in other assets of  the net cash provided in was primarily due to the sale of our holdings of series b and series c preferred stock of sonoma systems  which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment  and net purchases of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was   and  for  and  respectively 
the net cash provided in was due to the exercise of stock options under our stock option plans  which was partially offset by payments of capital lease obligations 
net cash provided in was due to the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans  and was partially offset by payments of capital lease obligations 
net cash provided in was primarily due to the private placements of common stock  and the exercise of stock options under the employee stock option plans 
no net cash was provided by or used for discontinued operations in or net cash provided by discontinued operations was  in we believe that cash and short term investment balances  at december  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may also consider the acquisition of  or evaluate investments in  products and businesses complementary to our business 
any such acquisitions or investments may require additional capital resources 
at december  our long term liquidity needs consisted principally of operating lease commitments related to facilities and office equipment 
european monetary union in january  eleven european countries  including france and germany  where we maintain operations  implemented a single currency the euro to replace their separate currencies 
while transactions may still be consummated in the individual currencies of the member countries until july  we will be required to  and are currently in the process of  implementing modifications to our payroll and benefits systems as well as our contracts and other obligations in order to accommodate the euro 
we do not currently believe that we will incur a material financial expense in connection with such modifications 
the introduction of the euro presents certain risks for us including risks associated with our reduced ability to adjust pricing of our products based on local currencies  fluctuations in the euro based on economic turmoil in countries other than those in which we do business and other risks normally associated with doing business in international currencies  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a quantitative information about market risk 
vertel s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment policy that ensures the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
as of december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments with a weighted average variable rate of and  respectively 
as of december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents and  of short term investments with a weighted average variable rate of and  respectively 
at december  we had no short or long term debt 
at december  we had  of short term fixed rate debt 
b qualitative information about market risk while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  a portion of our worldwide operations have a functional currency other than the united states dollar 
in particular  we maintain operations in france  germany  japan  korea  the netherlands  poland and the united kingdom  where the functional currencies are french franc  deutschemark  yen  won  dutch guilder  zloty and british pound  respectively 
most of our revenues are denominated in the united states dollar 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could also result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations cannot be predicted adequately 
to date  exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our earnings and we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
we do not have a policy relating to hedging 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by us would be successful or that our results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
our foreign assets are not material 
we mitigate default and interest rate risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor and by placing our portfolio under the management of professional money managers who invest within specified parameters established by the board of directors 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification
